CHAPTER 1
Introduction
Open a book — any book —on the economics of developing countries, and it will begin with
the usual litany of woes. Developing countries, notwithstanding the enormous strides they
have made in the last few decades, display fundamental economic inadequacies in a wide
range of indicators. Levels of physical capital per person are small. Nutrition levels are low.
Other indicators of human capital such as education — both at the primary and seconday
levels — are well below developed-country benchmarks. So are access to sanitation, safe
water and housing. Population growth rates are high, and so are infant mortality rates. One
could expand this list indefinitely.
Notice that some of these indicators — infant mortality or life expectancy, for instance —
may be regarded as defining features of underdevelopment, so in this respect the list above
may be viewed, not as a statement of correlations, but as a definition of what we mean by
development (or the lack of it). But other indicators, such as low quantities of physical capital
per capita, or population growth rates, are at least one step removed. These features don’t
define underdevelopment. For instance, it is unclear whether low fertility rates are intrinsically
a feature of economic welfare or development. Surely, many families in rich countries may
take great pleasure in having a large number of offspring. Likewise, large holdings of
physical capital may well have an instrumental value to play in the development process,
but surely the mere existence of such holdings does not constitute a defining characteristic
of economic welfare.
And indeed, that is how it should be. We do not make a list of the features that go hand in
hand with underdevelopment simply to define the term. We do so because — implictly
or explicitly — we are looking for explanations. Why are underdeveloped countries
underdeveloped?1
It is easy enough to point to these inadequacies in terms of physical
and human capital, but the extra step to branding these as causes of underdevelopment is
perilously close, and we should avoid taking that step. Low levels of capital, or low levels
of education, are just as much symptoms of development as causes, and to the extent that
1Perhaps the word “underdeveloped” does not constitute politically correct usuage, so that several publications
— those by well-known international organizations chief among them — use the somewhat more hopeful and
placatory present continuous “developing”. I won’t be using such niceties in this article, because it should be
clear — or at least it is clear in my mind — that economic underdevelopment pins no derogatory social label on
those who live in, or come from, such societies.
4 Introduction
they intertwine with and accompany the development process (or the lack of it), we cannot
rely on these observations as explanations.
That doesn’t stop economists from offering such explanations, however. More than one
influential study has regressed growth rates (alternatively, levels) of per-capita income on
variables such as the rate of savings and population growth. There is very little doubt, in fact,
that such variables are significantly associated with per-capita income. But nevertheless,
we do have to think about the sense in which these studies serve as explanations for
underdevelopment.
For instance, is it the case that individuals in different parts of the world have some intrinsic
difference in their willingness — or ability — to save, or to procreate? If this were the case,
we could hang our hat on the following sort of theory: such-and-such country is populated
by people who habitually save very little. This is why they are underdeveloped.
Somehow, this does not seem right. We would like to have a theory which — while not
belittling or downplaying the role of social, cultural and political factors — does not simply
stop there. We would like to know, for instance, whether low incomes provoke, in turn,
low savings rates so that we have a genuine chicken-and-egg problem. The same is true of
demographics — underdevelopment might be a cause of high population growth rates, just
as high population growth rates themselves retard the development process.
My goal in these notes is to talk about some of these chicken-and-egg situations, in which
underdevelopment is seen not as a failure of some fundamental economic parameters,
or socio-cultural values, but as an interacting “equilibrium” that hangs together, perhaps
precipitated by inertia or by history. [Indeed, in what follows, I will make a conceptual
distinction between equilibria created by inertia and those created by history.]
Why is this view of the development process an important one? There are three reasons
why I feel this view should be examined very seriously.
[1] This point of view leads to a theory, or a set of theories, in which economic “convergence”
(of incomes, wealth, levels of well-being) across countries is not to be automatically had.
Actually, the intelligent layperson reading these words will find this reasoning a bit abstruse:
why on earth would one expect convergence in the first place? And why, indeed, should I
find a theory interesting on the grounds that it does not predict convergence, when I knew
that all along? This is not a bad line of reasoning, but to appreciate why it is misguided, it is
important to refer to a venerable tradition in economics that has convergence as its very core
prediction. The idea is based — roughly — on the argument that countries which are poor
will have higher marginal products of capital, and consequently a higher rate of return to
capital. This means that a dollar of extra savings will have a higher payoff in poor countries,
allowing it grow faster. The prediction: pooere countries will tend to grow faster, so that
over time rich and poor countries will come together, or “converge”.
This is not the place to examine the convergence hypothesis in detail, as my intention is
to cover other views of development.2 But one should notice that convergence theories
in this raw form have rarely been found acceptable (though rarely does not mean never,
2
See Ray [1998], Chapters 2 and 3.
Introduction 5
among some economists), and there are several subtle variants of the theory. Some of
these variants still preserve the idea that lots of “other things” being equal, convergence
in some conditional sense is still to be had. It’s only if we start accepting the possibility
that — perhaps — these “other things” cannot be kept equal, that the notion of conditional
convergence starts losing its relevance and very different views of development, not at all
based on the idea of convergence, must be sought.
[2] The second reason why I find these theories important is that they do not reply on
“fundamental” differences across peoples or cultures. Thus we may worry about whether
Confucianism is better than the Protestant ethic in promoting hard-headed, succesful
economic agents, and we might certainly decry Hindu fatalism as deeply inimical to
purposeful, economic self-advancement, but we have seen again and again that when it
comes down to the economic crunch and circumstances are right, both Confucian and
Hindu will make the best of available opportunities — and so will the Catholics and a host
of other relgions and cultures besides. Once again, this is not the place to examine in detail
fundamentalist explanations based on cultural or religious differences, but I simply don’t
find them very convincing. This is not to say that culture — like conditional convergence
— does not play a role. [In fact, I provide such examples below.] But I also take the view
that culture, along with several other economic, social and political institutions, are all part
of some broader interactive theory in which “first cause” is to be found — if at all — in
historical accident.
[3] The last reason why I wish to focus on these theories is that create a very different role for
government policy. Specifically, I will argue that these theories place a much greater weight
on one-time, or temporary, interventions than theories that are based on fundamentals. For
instance, if it is truly Hindu fatalism that keeps Indian savings rates low, then a policy of
encouraging savings (say, through tax breaks) will certainly have an effect on growth rates.
But there is no telling when that policy can be taken away, or indeed, if it can be taken away
at all. For in the absence of the policy, the theory would tell us that savings would revert
to the old Hindu level. In contrast, a theory that is based on an interactive chicken-and-egg
approach would promote a policy that attempts to push the chicken-egg cycle into a new
equilibrium. Once that happens, the policy can be removed. This is not to say that once-andfor-all
policies are the correct ones, but only to appreciate that the interactive theories I am
going to talk about have very different implications from the traditional ones.

CHAPTER 2
The Calibration Game
The simple model of convergence also has to be put through enormous contortions to fit the
most essential development facts regarding per-capita income across countries. This is the
point of the current section.
2.1 Some Basic Facts
Low per capita incomes are an important feature of economic underdevelopment—perhaps
the most important feature—and there is little doubt that the distribution of income across
the world’s nations is extraordinarily skewed.
The World Development Report (see, e.g., World Bank [2003]) contains estimates for all
countries, converted to a common currency. By this yardstick, the world produced
approximately $32 trillion of output in 2001. A little less than $6 trillion of this — less
than 20% — came from low- and middle-income developing countries (around 85% of the
world’s population). Switzerland, one of the world’s richest countries, enjoyed a per capita
income close to 400 times that of Ethiopia, one of the world’s poorest.
A serious discrepancy arises from the fact that prices for many goods in all countries are not
appropriately reflected in exchange rates. This is only natural for goods and services that are
not internationally traded. The International Comparison Program publishes PPP estimates
of income, and under these the differences are still huge, but no longer of the order of 500:1.
Over the period 1960–2000, the richest 5% of the world’s nations averaged a per capita
income (PPP) that was about twenty-nine times the corresponding figure for the poorest
5%. As Parente and Prescott [2000] quite correctly observed, interstate disparities within the
United States do not even come close to these international figures. In 2000, the richest state
in the United States was Connecticut and the poorest was Mississippi, and the ratio of per
capita incomes worked out to slightly less than 2!
Of course, the fact that the richest 5% of countries bear approximately the same ratio of
incomes (relative to the poorest 5%) does not suggest that the entire world distribution
of incomes has remained stationary. Of greatest interest — a recent financial crisis
notwithstanding — is the meteoric rise of the East Asian economies: Japan, Korea, Taiwan,
8 The Calibration Game
Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and (commencing somewhat later)
China. Over the period 1965–90, the per capita incomes of the aforementioned eight East
Asian economies (excluding China) increased at an annual rate of 5.5%. Over 1990–1999,
the pace slowed somewhat, especially in Japan, but averaged well over 3% per year for the
remainder.1
Impressive as these rates are, they are dwarfed by China’s phenomenal performance.
Between 1980 and 1990, China’s per capita income grew at an annual rate of 8.6%. The
corresponding figure for the 1990s is even higher: around 9.6%.
In contrast, much of Latin America languished during the 1980s. After relatively high rates
of economic expansion in the two preceding decades, growth slowed to a crawl, and in many
cases there was no growth at all. Morley’s [1995] study observed that in Latin America, per
capita income fell by 11% during the 1980s, and only Chile and Colombia had a significantly
higher per capita income in 1990 than they did in 1980. It is certainly true that such figures
should be treated cautiously, given the extreme problems of accurate GNP measurement in
high-inflation countries, but they illustrate the situation well enough. With some notable
exceptions (such as Chile, 5.7%, and Argentina, 3.6%), annual per-capita growth in incomes
continues to be extremely slow for Latin America in the 1990s, though these rates did turn
positive through most of the region.
Similarly, much of Africa stagnated or declined over the 1980s. Countries such as Nigeria
and Tanzania experienced substantial declines of per capita income, whereas countries such
as Kenya and Uganda barely grew in per capita terms. Notable turnarounds in the 1990s
have occurred in both directions, with alarming declines in countries such as the Congo,
Rwanda and Burundi, and substantial progress in Uganda.
Looking at the overall picture once more without naming countries, one can get a good
sense of the world income distribution by looking at mobility matrices, an idea first applied
to countries by Danny Quah. I’ve constructed one such matrix using 132 countries over the
period 1980–2000; see Figure 2.1.
Each row and column in this matrix is per-capita income relative to world per-capita income.
The rows represent these ratios in 1980; the columns the corresponding ratios in 2000. The
cell entries represent percentages of countries in each row-column combination, the rows
adding up to 100 each. So, for instance, 88% of the countries that earned less than than a
quarter of world per-capita income in 1980 continued to do just that in 2000.
Clearly, while there is no evidence that very poor countries are doomed to eternal poverty,
there is some indication that both very low and very high incomes are extremely sticky.
Middle-income countries have far greater mobility than either the poorest or the richest
countries. For instance, countries in category 1 (between half the world average and the
world average) in 1980 moved away to “right” and “left”: less than half of them remained
where they were in 1980. In stark contrast to this, fully 88% of the poorest countries
(category 1/4) in 1980 remained where they were, and none of them went above the world
average by 2000. Likewise, another 88% of the richest countries in 1980 stayed right where
1To appreciate how high these rates of growth really are, note that for the entire data set of 102 countries studied
by Parente and Prescott, per capita growth averaged 1.9% per year over the period 1960–85.

they were. This is interesting because it suggests that although everything is possible (in
principle), a history of underdevelopment or extreme poverty puts countries at a tremendous
disadvantage.
There is actually a bit more to Figure 2.1 than lack of mobility at the extremes. Look at the
next-to-poorest category (those with incomes between one-quarter and one-half of the world
10 The Calibration Game
average in 1962). Almost half of them dropped to an even lower category. Thus it is not only
the lowest-income countries that might be caught in a very difficult situation. In general, at
low levels of income, the overall tendency seems to be movement in the downward direction.
My book contains a corresponding mobility matrix for 1963–1984, with very similar findings.
To summarize, then, we have the following observations.
(1) Over the period 1960–2000, the relative distribution of world income appears to have been
quite stable. The richest 5% of the world’s nations averaged a level of per capita income
that was about 29 times the corresponding figure for the poorest 5%. By any standards,
this disparity is staggering, and especially so when we remember that we are talking about
incomes that have been corrected for purchasing power parity.
(2) The fact that the overall distribution has remained stationary does not mean that there
has been little movement of countries within the world distribution. Of particular interest
in the 1980s is the rise of the East Asian economies and the languishing of other economies,
particularly those of sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. Diverse growth experiences
such as these can change the economic composition of the world in the space of a few
decades. Nonetheless, a single explanation for this diversity remains elusive.
(3) The observation that several countries have changed relative positions suggests that there
are no ultimate traps to development. At the same time, a history of wealth or poverty does
seem to partly foretell future developments. The mobility of countries appears to be highest
somewhere in the middle of the wealth distribution, whereas a history of underdevelopment
or extreme poverty appears to put countries at a disadvantage.
(4) That history matters in this way is an observation that requires a careful explanation.
Poor countries do seem to have some advantages. They can use, relatively free of charge,
technologies that are developed by their richer counterparts. Scarce capital in these countries
should display a higher rate of profit, because of the law of diminishing returns. They can
learn from mistakes that their predecessors have made. In this way differences across
countries should iron themselves out over the longer run. Thus the observation that history
matters in maintaining persistent differences needs more of a justification than might be
obvious at first glance.
One can see different attempts to reconcile the failure of convergence with the traditional
theory:
(A) Hardline View. Don’t abandon the traditional aggregative theory but seek reasons for
productivity and other controls to be systematically different across countries. Conditional
on those controls, attempt to establish convergence.
(B) Multiplicity View. Abandon the convergence argument. Argue that the same fundamentals
can progress in very different directions depending on initial conditions.
(C) Interactive View. Argue that the world is one interactive system and cannot be split up
into several growth models (with or without convergence) running side by side.
In these notes we shall spend some time with each of these views.
The Calibration Game 11
2.2 The Parente-Prescott and Lucas Calibrations
Normalize labor to 1, and consider the following aggregative production function:
yt = Atk
θ
t
,
where At captures some exogenous growth of TFP. It will be convenient to bestow on At the
exponential form
At = A(1 + γ)
(1−θ)t
,
so that (1 + γ)
(1−θ)t − 1 can be thought of as the growth rate of TFP. We have written things
in the slightly ugly form so as to simplify the expressions later.
One way to think about it is to interpret γ as the growth rate of labor productivity. That
would translate into output productivity by a power of 1 − θ.
Write the capital accumulation equation:
kt+1 = (1 − δ)kt + xt
,
where δ is the depreciation rate and x is the flow of fresh investment. By the savings–
investment equality and the Solow assumption that savings is proportional to per-capita
income, we see that
xt = syt
,
where s is the savings rate. We can combine all these equations and proceed as follows:
Define k
∗
t
≡ kt/(1 + γ)
t
; then the capital-accumulation equation implies that
(1 + γ)

and dividing through by (1 + γ)

(1 − δ) + s

Now yt/kt simply equals A/k

1−θ

simply converges to k

(1 − δ) + s
A
k

or

It follows that kt converges to the path

t

sA
γ + δ
!1/(1−θ)
,
so that yt converges to the path
A(1 + γ)
t

sA
γ + δ
!θ/(1−θ)
.
We may therefore conclude that in steady state, the effect of varying the savings rate only
depends on the ratio θ/(1 − θ).
12 The Calibration Game
But this has small effects. We know that in a Cobb-Douglas world of perfect competition,
θ is a good proxy for the share of capital in national income. Lucas (1990) uses an estimate
for that share of around 0.4, so that the ratio in question is around 2/3. This means that
a doubling of the savings rate — a huge increase — will only raise steady state per-capita
incomes by a factor of 22/3
, which is around a 60% increase. This comes nowhere close to
the inequalities we see around us.
Parente and Prescott (2000) impute around 70% to labor income and 5% to land, which leaves
them with a capital share of 25%. With that our required ratio is even lower: θ/(1−θ) = 1/3.
That means that a doubling of the savings rate only translates into a 25% variation in percapita
income.
And moreover, the savings rates in the richest countries are nowhere close to double that
of their poor counterparts. In 1993, the industrialized countries averaged a savings rate of
19.4%. The LDCs actually had a higher savings rate during that period — 23.3% — while
even Africa had a savings rate of 18.8%.
Notice that TFP differentials in productivity give us a better chance to explain differentials:
whereas across two countries 1 and 2,
y1
y2
=


s2
θ/(1−θ)
,
for technical levels the difference is more amplified:
y1
y2
=

A1
A2
1/(1−θ)
.
When θ is 1/3, the savings difference translate into income differences as the square root,
while for technology differences the ratio is taken to the power 1.5. So, for instance, a
doubling of the technology difference “explains” a difference of close to three times in percapita
output. This is a bit closer to what we see, and it is small wonder, then, that those who
are wedded to Solow-type convergence models have been inclined to focus on technological
differences.
Actually, the above calibrations, which are due to Parente and Prescott (2000) (see also
Mankiw, Romer and Weil (1992)) can be given a sharper and more immediate expresson by
simply using the production function and no more. This is the route taken in Lucas (1990).
Once again begin with the Cobb-Douglas production function
y = Akθ
(note, no time subscripts, I won’t even need to do any growth theory). Use the competitive
condition to assert that the rate of return to capital is given by
r = Aθk
θ−1
,
or equivalently
r = θA
1/θy
(θ−1)/θ
.
The Calibration Game 13
Once again take the share of capital to be 1/3; then θ = 1/3, so that across two countries 1
and 2,
r1
r2
=

y2
y1
!2
.
This yields absurd numbers. If the per-capita income in the US is 15 times larger than that of
India, the rate of return on capital in India should be over 200 times higher! Even if the share
of capital in production is taken to be 0.4 (used by Lucas), the ratio in the rates of return
should be close to 60, also plainly absurd.
There are alternative routes out of this dilemma.
2.2.1 Differences in Human Capital. Of course, we should get the immediate alternative
out of the way first, which is that labor qualities in the two countries are not the same. So
differences in per-capita income are not the same as differences in income per “effective
capita”. For instance, Anne Krueger (1968) attempts to compare US and Indian workers
by looking at information on each country’s mix of workers (by age, education and sector)
and combining this with (US-based) estimates of how these factors affect productivity (as
measured by relative earnings).
Krueger obtains an overall ratio of one US worker = approx. 5 Indian workers. This means
that the ratio income per effective capita is 3, but this too generates a rate of return differential
between 5 (if capital’s share is 40%) and 9 (if that share is set lower at 1/3). This difference is
also “too large”, and there is still a lot left to explain.
[Update on Krueger and per-capita income differentials: Heston, Summers and Aten (2002)
argue that in 1990 the PPP income differences were perhaps 11:1. Banerjee and Duflo (2004)
adjust the Krueger estimates of relative worker productivity to about 10:3. This leaves us
effectively in the same place: the adjusted ratio is then about 3.2, which creates the same
differentials in the rates of return as in the previous paragraph.]
2.2.2 Differences in TFP. Now let’s turn our attention to technological differences. Let
us look at the implicit TFP ratios needed if we were to equalize rates of return in the two
countries and maintain the requirement that per-(effective) capita income ratios are around
3. Use subscripts I for India and U for the US; then the equality of the two rates of return to
capital demands that

provided that the share of capital is around a third. So this means that
AU
AI

2/3 = 2.08.
It is hard to get a feel for whether this is a large difference or a small one. One way of looking
at it: if the US and India put in the same amounts of capital and quality-corrected labor into
production, the US will produce twice as much as India. This may be a tall order.
14 The Calibration Game
Nother way: Lucas’s view is that this difference is attributable to an externality created by
human capital. Suppose that the externality is proportional to h
a
, where a is some coefficient
and h is the human capital endowment per capita. Then
AU
AI
=

hU
hI
!a
.
Lucas estimates a at around 0.36, using Denision’s productivity comparisons within the
United States over 1909 and 1958, and combining them with human capital endowments
over the same period. Because 50.36 ' 1.8, this takes care of the problem as far as Lucas is
concerned.
2.2.3 Misallocation of Capital. Another way to think about it is to generate the productivity
differences from the misallocation of capital in a disaggregated model. Banerjee and
Duflo (2004) adopt this approach, but there is an interesting tension here. To generate
serious misallocation problems, one must presume that the marginal product of capital is
substantially different across small and large firms. But this means that capital has high
curvature in production, so that one must choose correspondingly smaller values of θ.
Assuming that capital is misallocated cannot provide a ready fix on this problem.
That said, credit constraints and consequent misallocation of resources may well be
important.
2.2.4 The Share of Capital. One way out is to somehow enlarge the share of capital, and
in this way the value of θ. Parente and Prescott (2000, p. 44–55) discuss this route in some
detail, by considering intangible forms of capital and the possibility that physical capital is
grossly mismeasured, but these adjustments are just not enough.
2.2.5 Government Failure. One view is that governments might expropriate new investors,
while existing investors (who may be unproductive) are overprotected. This is
a view in which incumbent elites are not necessarily the best business hands, yet they are
in a position to control the entrance of others more efficient than they are. This is related
to political-economy arguments made by Engerman and Sokoloff and Acemoglu-JohnsonRobinson
that we will discuss later in the course.
Parente and Prescott consider a variant of this point of view, in which they regard the
government as intervening excessively and thus lowering productivity.
Another sort of government failure may arise from the lack of intervention, such as
intervention to protect property rights. Certain types of long-run investment may then
not be made (see Besley, Bandiera, or Goldstein-Udry). Or there may be various free-rider
problems in joint production, as also overexploitation of the commons.
2.3 Summing Up
Convergence relies on diminishing returns to “capital”. If this is our assumed starting point,
the share of capital in national income does give us rough estimates of the concavity of
The Calibration Game 15
production in capital. The problem is that the resulting concavity understates observed
variation in cross-country income by orders of magnitude. Huge variations in the savings
rate do not change world income by much. For instance, doubling the savings rate leads
to a change in steady state income by a factor of 1.25, which is inadequate to explain an
observed range of around 20:1 (PPP). Indeed, as Lucas (1990) observes, the discrepancy
actually appears in a more primitive way, at the level of the production function (even
without the attendant steady state theory). For the same simple production function to fit
the data on per-capita income differences, a poor country would have to have enormously
higher rates of return to capital; say, 60 times higher if it is one-fifteenth as rich. This is
implausible. And so begins the hunt for other factors that might explain the difference.
What did we not control for, but should have?
This is the kind of mindset that you will take on board if you get on the convergence boat. The
Solow benchmark of convergence must be tested against the empirical evidence on world
income distributions, savings rates, or rates of return to capital. The two will usually fail to
agree. Then we look for the missing variables that will bridge Solow (or some close variant
thereof) to the data. Thus it is not uncommon to find economists “explaining” inter-country
variation by stating that one country is more corrupt than another, or more democratic, or
is imbued with some particularly hardworking cultural ethic.
With careful economists such as the ones I have cited here, the argument is conducted far
more responsibly. “Human capital” is often used as a first port of call: might differences
here account for observed cross-country variation? The rest is usually attributed to that
familiar black box: “technological differences”. As one might imagine, that slot can be
filled in a variety of ways: externalities arising from human capital, incomplete diffusion of
technology, excessive government intervention, within-country misallocation of resources,
take your pick. All of these — and more — are interesting candidates, but by now we have
wandered far from the original convergence model, and if at all that model still continues
to illuminate, it is by way of occasional return to the recalibration exercise, after choosing
plausible specifications for each of these potential explanations.
The Solow model and its immediate variants don’t do a bad job. In the right hands,
the model serves as a quick and ready fix on the world, and it organizes a search for
possible explanations. Taken with the right grain of salt, and viewed as a first pass, such
an exercise can be immensely useful. At another level, playing this game too seriously
reveals a particular world-view. It suggests a fundamental belief that the world economy
is ultimately a great leveller, and that if the levelling is not taking place we must search
for that explanation in parameters that are somehow structurally rooted in a society. These
parameters cause economic growth, or the lack of it.
To be sure, the factors identified in these calibration exercises do go hand in hand with
underdevelopment. So do bad nutrition, high mortality rates, or lack of access to sanitation,
safe water and housing. Yet there is no ultimate causal chain: many of these features go hand
in hand with low income in self-reinforcing interplay. By the same token, corruption, culture,
procreation and politics are all up for serious cross-examination: just because “cultural
factors” (for instance) seems more weighty an “explanation” does not permit us to assign it
the status of a truly exogenous variable.
16 The Calibration Game
In other words, the convergence predicted by technologically diminishing returns to inputs
should not blind us to the possibility of nonconvergent behavior when all variables are
treated as they should be — as variables that potentially make for underdevelopment, but
also as variables that are profoundly affected by the development process.
This leads to a different way of asking the development question, one that is not grounded
in any presumption of convergence. Quite unlike the convergence hypothesis, the starting
presumption is distinct: two economies with the same fundamentals can move apart along
very different paths. Several factors might lead to such divergence, among them various
processes of cumulative causation, or poverty-traps, or initial histories that determined —
at least to some degree — the future that followed.
CHAPTER 3
Expectations and Multiple Equilibrium
3.1 Complementarities
Let n be the number of players and A1, . . . , An be n action sets, one for each player. Suppose
that the sets are ordered by “≥”. For each player i there is a payoff function πi
: A → R,
where A is the product of the actions sets. Say that this game exhibits complementarities if
whenever a−i ≥ a
0
−i
, then
arg max
ai
π(ai
, a−i) ≥ arg max
ai
π(ai
, a
0
−i
).
It will suffice for the purpose of these notes to provide a simplified and more special
description. Suppose that a set of individuals all have access to some set of actions A,
taken to be a subset of the real line. Denote by a a generic action, ai
the action taken by
individual i, and by mi
the average of all actions other than the one taken by i.
Assume that the payoff function is given by πi(a, m) for each individual i, where a denotes
his action and m denotes the average action taken by everybody else. Then it is easy to see
that there are complementarities in our more general sense if for all i,
(3.1) πi(a, m) − πi(a
0
, m) is increasing in m
whenever a > a
0 are two actions in the set A.
Notice the difference between complementarities and positive externalities. The former
change the marginal gain to taking an action while the latter affects payoff levels. Changes in
the marginal gain are compatible with payoff levels going in either direction.
As we shall see, Pareto-ordered outcomes are typical of these situations (though they won’t
necessarily happen).
3.2 Some Examples
3.2.1 Qwerty. There are two technologies; call them [Q]werty and [D]vorak. There are
many individuals, each of whom employs a single Q-trained secretary or a single D-trained
secretary. The cost of installing each technology is the same, but the cost expended on a
18 Expectations and Multiple Equilibrium
secretary is a decreasing function of the number of other people using the same secretary
type. [More secretarial schools exist for that type.] This is a situation of complementarities.
The same goes for technologies such as PCs and Macs, in which the benefits from adopting
the technology depend positively on the number of other users (networking).
3.2.2 Infrastructure. A railroad is used for transporting products from the interior to the
ports. People are indexed on [0, 1], and person i gets a benefit B(i) from being able to use the
railroad. The cost of railroad use is declining in the number of users: c(n), where n is the
number of users and c
0
(n) < 0. This is a situation of complementarities.
3.2.3 Finance. A thicker financial market caused by lots of people putting their money
in financial assets can create the possibilities of greater diversification. So at the margin, it
becomes easier for an individual investor to invest.
3.2.4 Capital Deepening. Greater roundaboutness in production increases the productivity
of capital, the scale of aggregate production, and in this way the final demand
for individual machine varieties. This may in turn justify the greater roundaboutness of
production.
3.2.5 Social Capital. High rural-urban migration can destroy social capital back in rural
areas. In turn, that destruction can increase the pace of rural-urban migration.
3.2.6 Discrimination. Individuals discriminated against may not invest in human capital,
perpetuating that discrimination.
3.2.7 Currency Crises. Apart from the fundamentals of holding or selling a currency,
there is a strong incentive to sell if other individuals are selling. This forms the basis of a
class of currency-crisis theories based on complementarities.
3.2.8 Endogenous Growth. Economy-wide investment raises the return to individual
investment, thus potentially generating a sustainable growth path.
3.2.9 Social Norms. Sometimes, social norms can change a Prisoner’s Dilemma to a
coordination game. Examples: spitting in public, throwing garbage on the streets, or
engaging in tariff wars. Sometimes repeated interactions can imitate the same outcome
(though with many agents this is hard).
3.3 Complementarities and Development
The ordinary view of capitalist development is that it inflicts negative externalities: pollution,
greed and so on. This is certainly true. But there is an important sense in which the capitalist
investment process creates severe complementarities (whether the underlying externalities
are negative or positive; they could be either).
Expectations and Multiple Equilibrium 19
For instance, a firm that prides itself on quality and fair dealing will induce its competitors
to take the same actions simply to maintain business competitiveness, and could spark off a
quality race (the same applies to research and innovation, or indeed, low prices). Note that
the underlying externalities are negative but that we have a case of complementarities in the
appropriate action space.
In another context, the combined actions of several firms can (a) lower infrastructural costs,
(b) create demand for each others’ products, both directly and (c) by creating higher incomes;
and can (d) enable the creation of new products or the startup of some other productive
activity by making inputs available. These are complementarities, too, in the sense that
these actions of “investment” increase the incentive for other firms to ‘invest” as well. This
time the externalities are positive.
So complementarities can exist both with positive and with negative externalities. Indeed,
the medieval guild system was designed to avoid some of the complementaries which had
negative externalities attached to them — e.g., a new improvement had to be sanctioned
by existing guild members. As you can imagine, such an outcome cannot be stable unless
severe punishments were available for offenders, and such punishments themselves became
weaker as the guild system died away, provoking others to leave the guilds. [Thus the guild
story is also one of complementarities!]
It is very important to understand that while the distinction between positive and negative
externalities is important in understanding the normative properties of a particular
equilibrium, the distinction between complementarities and what might be called anticomplementarities
(reverse the movement of (3.1) in others’ actions) is essential in understanding
the possible variety in the development experience. Complementarities create the
possibility of multiple equilibria, so that we might argue that countries — or societies — are
in different equilibria though there is nothing intrinsically different between them.
3.4 Multiple Equilibrium
3.4.1 Complementarities through Demand. How do complementarities manifest themselves
in multiple equilibria? One way to begin exploring this is through the standard
general equilibrium model. Understand, first, that some amount of limited competition is
necessary. If the price at which an output is being sold (or an input being bought) is fixed,
then the agent can inflict no externality on another — he internalizes these externalities
through the price. But if the price drops as you sell more of a product (or the input price
raises), you are creating a gain for another agent that you fail to internalize. Thus perfect
competition may be at odds with the multiple equilibrium story that creates a set of Paretodominating
equilibria (of course, multiple equilibria that are Pareto-undominated are clearly
possible by classical considerations).
The route envisaged by Rosenstein-Rodan was two-fold. Investments everywhere create a
climate for more investment: (a) directly, via intersectoral changes in price, and (b) indirectly
via the generation of incomes. The parable of the shoe-factory emphasized (b). This is the
Rosenstein-Rodan story as extended by Murphy, Shleifer and Vishny [1989].
20 Expectations and Multiple Equilibrium
3.4.2 Pecuniary Externalities. Before I get into the Murphy-Shleifer-Vishny model it is
important to observe that the Rosenstein-Rodan view is one of pecuniary externalities, in
which one sort of change (investment) provokes another (investment somewhere else) via a
change in prices. Such externalities are to be contrasted with what one might call technological
externalities, in which there is a direct effect that has nothing to do with prices. (Using a PC
when lots of other people use a PC is a networking effect that is a technological externality.
Of course, one could also tell a pecuniary story in which a big market for PCs drives down
their prices and therefore makes it more attractive to buy one.)
Pecuniary externalities are natural. Tibor Scitovsky (1954), in a famous article, argued that
they are orders of magnitude more compelling than technological externalities. Indeed,
because of Rosenstein-Rodan and Hirschman, pecuniary externalities are viewed as the
fundamental process underlying development (or the lack of it).
But percuniary externalities are hard to model using competitive markets. Basically the
first fundamental theorem of welfare economics stands in the way. That theorem rules
out Pareto-ranked equilibria whenever there are no technological externalities. Let us very
quickly review the theorem in the context of a CRS production model.
Suppose that each person i has a utility function ui and a vector of endowments x(i). The
total endowment vector is x ≡
P
i x(i). Denote by c the vector of final consumption goods: it
is allocated among the population of all individuals with person i getting c(i).
There is a production technology T to convert x into c. Thus T is a set of feasible (c, x)
output-input pairs. We don’t make any particular assumption on T.
Note that production may generate positive profits so we have to distribute them among
the agents. Let θ(i) be the share of aggregate profits π that accrue to agent i.
Finally, there is a price vector p for the final goods and w for the endowments. Say that
(p
∗
, w
∗
, c ∗(i)) is a competitive equilibrium if, defining c
∗ ≡
P
i
c

(i), we have profit maximization:
π ≡ p

∗ − w

x ≥ p

for all (c

and utility maximization subject to budget constraints:
c
∗
(i) maximizes u(c(i)) on {c(i)|p
∗
c(i) ≤ w
∗
x(i) + θ(i)π}.
Proposition 3.1. A competitive equilibrium is Pareto optimal, so in particular there can be no
Pareto-ranked equilibria.
Proof. Suppose not. Then there exists an alternative vector of outputs c (feasible, so that
(c, x) ∈ T) and an allocation c(i) of it such that u(c(j)) ≥ u(c
∗
(j)) for all j, with strict inequality
for some j. But then by utility maximization, we must have
p
∗
c(j) ≥ p
∗
c
∗
(j) for all j, with strict inequality for some j,
and adding over all j, we must conclude that
p

c > p

c

.
Substracting the common term w
∗x from both sides of this inequality, we contradict the profit
maximization property.
Expectations and Multiple Equilibrium 21
This is why we employ some imperfect competition in the models of pecuniary externalities
that follow.
3.4.3 Model 1. The Profit Externality. There is a continuum of sectors indexed by q ∈ [0, 1].
The utility function for a consumer is
Z 1
0
ln x(q)dq.
With this utility function, when consumer income is given by y, an amount of y is spent on
every good q.
Now, normalize wage rate to unity; then y = π + L, where π is profits and L is the labor
endowment of a typical agent.
Now suppose that each sector has two technologies, a cottage technology which is freely
available without any setup cost, and an industrialized technology, which requires a setup
cost. In the former, assume that one unit of labor produces one unit of output. In the latter,
assume one unit of labor produces α units of output, where α > 1. But there is a setup cost,
which we denote by F > 0.
Now the cottage sector is competitive (while demand for each good is unitary elastic), so it
follows that if there is industrialization in some sector the price will be set at the limit price,
equal to one. Thus the profit from industrialization is given by
(3.2) y −
y
α
− F =
α − 1
α
y − F ≡ ay − F
The point, therefore, is that a larger y is more conducive to industrialization. To complete
the circle, more industrialization is also conducive to a larger value of y. To see this, notice
that if a fraction n of the sectors do industrialize, then profits per firm are
π(n) = ay − F
so that aggregate income y(n) is given by
y(n) = nπ(n) + L = n[ay(n) − F] + L,
or equivalently
(3.3) y(n) =
L − nF
1 − an
.
Notice that
y
0
(n) =
(aL − F)/(1 − an)
1 − an
and that
(3.4) π(n) = ay(n) − F =
aL − F
1 − an
so that combining these two equations we get
(3.5) y
0
(n) =
π(n)
1 − an
22 Expectations and Multiple Equilibrium
Note that (3.5) exhibits a multiplier-like quality because of the externality. Extra profits
create more than their own weight in income, while higher income in turn can spur
industrialization. This is a classic case of complementarities.
But it isn’t so classic in one respect. Oddly enough, despite the complementarity, there can
only be a single equilibrium in this model. If F < aL, then this means that at y(0) = L it is
worth industrializing, so everyone will. On the other hand, if F > aL, then from equation (3.4)
it is not worth industrializing even when income is all the way at y(1) (set n = 1 in (3.4) and
evaluate π(1)).
[To be sure, when F = aL there are, in fact, a continuum of equilibria but they are all
equivalent in that they generate the same level of national income.]
One possible “explanation” for uniqueness is that the model is too simple: there isn’t enough
heterogeneity among the firms. Let’s satisfy ourselves that this has nothing to do with it.
Suppose that the fixed costs vary smoothly across sectors, all the way from zero to infinity.
Order the sectors so that F(0) = 0, F(1) = ∞, and F(i) is smoothly increasing. Then if n sectors
invest, it must be the interval of firms [0, n] that’s doing the investing, and the following
zero-profit condition must hold:
(3.6) ay(n) − F(n) = 0,
where
(3.7) y(n) =
Z n
0
π(i)di + L,
and
(3.8) π(i) = ay(n) − F(i)
for each i. Let A(n) denote the average value of all the fixed costs on [0, n]; then combining
(3.7) and (3.8) we see that
y(n) = any(n) − nA(n) + L
or
y(n) =
L − nA(n)
1 − an
,
and using this information in (3.6), and moving terms around, we see that
(3.9) [1 − an]F(n) + anA(n) = aL
is the fully reduced-form zero-profit condition. Can there be more than one solution in n
to this condition? Differentiating the LHS of (3.9) shows that the derivative is [1 − an]F
0
(n),
which is positive. There cannot be more than one solution.
Why does the complementarity have no effect? It does not because the externality is
generated by the payoff of the firm. At all points for which the marginal payoff is positive
(and so is the externality), the firm pushes ahead and produces more. It does not internalize
the externality but it does not need to — the privately profitable and the socially profitable
moves coincide. Likewise for the case in which profits are negative. There is a cutback which
Expectations and Multiple Equilibrium 23
enhances both private and social outcomes at the same time. So even though there is an
externality, the actions fully internalize the externality, as it were.
One lesson from all this is that the Rosenstein-Rodan intuition needs to be examined more
carefully. The source of the complementarity must be something other than private profit
alone.
The main idea in what follows — and this is perhaps the lesson of the Murphy-ShleiferVishny
exercise — is that (to obtain multiplicity) one needs an externality source which isn’t
effectively internalized by the externality provider. For instance, if there are taxes on output
(with proceeds given, say, lump-sum to the economy), then the profit-maximum for a firm
will not correspond to the point at which the marginal externality washes out. Likewise for
the example that we discuss below.
3.4.4 Model 2. The Wage Externality. Suppose that industrialization not only benefits
the industrializing firm, it also benefits workers in that firm in the form of higher wages.
These higher wages need not mean higher utility: they could be compensation for a higher
disutility of labor. Or they may be Shapiro-Stiglitz type wages designed to prevent shirking
in a hard-to-monitor activity. Or there may be political and economic pressures to keep
wages above some stipulated minimum in the organized industrial sector.
Let the (additive) wage premium be v, so that the wage to be paid is 1 + v. Now the
monopolists’s profit from industrializing in any particular sector is
(3.10) π = y −
1 + v
α
y − F(1 + v)
when the total demand for that sector is given by y.
This specification can generate multiple equilibria. If there is no industrialization, then
y = L. This is self-justifying if profits, evaluated at this level of income, are nonpositive.
That is, using (3.10), we have the condition
(3.11) L

1 −
1 + v
α

− F(1 + v) ≤ 0.
On the other hand, to see if one can have an equilibrium in which all industrialize, one must
have the condition that profits are nonnegative when aggregate income (and hence demand)
is evaluated at the full-industrialization point. Aggregate income is given by
y(1) = Π + L(1 + v) =

1 −
1 + v
α

y(1) − F(1 + v) + L(1 + v),
or
(3.12) y(1) = α(L − F).
[This is an intuitive expression, since the RHS corresponds to the total output produced.] So
profits are nonnegative at the full industrialization point if

1 −
1 + v
α

α(L − F) − F(1 + v) ≤ 0,
24 Expectations and Multiple Equilibrium
and rewriting this, we obtain the condition
(3.13) L

1 −
1 + v
α

− F ≥ 0.
Now (3.11) and (3.13) can easily be compared to see why multiplicity is possible.
A similar exercise can be carried out using the heterogeneous-cost variant. Make the same
assumptions on the function F(i) as before. Then the equilibrium condition is given by
(3.14) y(n)

1 −
1 + v

= F(n)(1 + v).

where
π(i) = y(n) −

[1 + (1 + v)/α]
[Notice that (3.16) reduces to (3.9) when v = 0, so that there is no possibility of multiple
equilibrium when v = 0.]
You can differentiate both sides of this condition, just as we did before, to provide restrictions
for which multiple equilibria are possible.
Model 3. Separation of Costs and Benefits
Another example of the general principle discussed earlier, but we don’t do this in class; of minor
importance.
If the setup costs and the later revenues are separated in time, then the latter will drive
demand, while industrializers care about revenues net of setup costs. This will be sufficient
to drive a wedge between private and socially optimal decision-making.
Expectations and Multiple Equilibrium 25
There is a problem though. For the economy to go through this deferred industrialization
process, the interest rate must rise to encourage consumption postponement. For the
industrializers, this brings up the opportunity cost of investing in industrialization.
If no one industrializes, then income is (L, L) and β =
1
1+r
solves out for the interest rate. So
the condition for no industrialization is simply
(3.17) βaL − F ≤ 0.
On the other hand, if full industrialzation occurs, current output is L − F and in the next
period it is αL. This must be rationalized by the Euler equation for aggregate consumption.
If u denotes the indirect utility of current consumption of the composite, then solve
max u(c1) + βu(c2),
subject to
c1 +

c2 = present value of income,

Are (3.17) and (3.18) compatible? Yes, if the interest rate does not rise by too much. [Actually,
with the logarithmic specification employed by Murphy, Shleifer and Vishny [1989], this does
not work, but if the indirect utility function of composite consumption has higher elasticity
than logarithmic, (3.17) and (3.18) can be compatible.]
3.4.5 Complementarity through the Production Process. “The division of labor is
limited by the size of the market.” Thus spake Adam Smith, and he spake well. A large
market size encourages investments that may be complicated and costly, but have immensely
high productivity. The deeper insight of Allyn Young was to note that the converse is also
true: the “division of labor”, or production roundaboutness, also determines the size of the
market. In this sense, roundaboutness begets roundaboutness.
The example that we consider has to do with the provision of intermediate inputs that
are required in the production of final output in the economy. One feature of economic
development is the creation and use of increasingly sophisticated methods of production,
often characterized by their “roundaboutness.” Almost any productive activity can serve
as an example. Let’s take construction. In developing countries, construction is a pretty
labor-intensive activity. The area is cleared by hand, rubble is removed in small baskets
carried by hand, cement is often mixed at the site and carried by hand, and walls are put
up brick by brick. In industrialized economies, each of these tasks has been automated:
cranes are used for clearing and prefabricated walls are erected at the site. Each automated
instrument, in turn, is produced through a complicated activity: think about how cranes
and prefabricated walls are themselves produced. Thus the final production of a house is
reduced to a large series of automated steps, each of a high degree of sophistication and
requiring the provision of many intermediate inputs.
26 Expectations and Multiple Equilibrium
These sophisticated inputs can be extremely costly to produce if they going to be sold in tiny
markets. The manufacture and sale of cranes requires that there be a fairly large demand
for cranes in construction, and so it is with prefabricated walls. Otherwise it is simply not
worth setting up separate plants to manufacture these items. In other words, intermediate
inputs are often produced under conditions of increasing returns to scale.
At the same time, the provision of intermediate inputs, and the consequent roundaboutness
of production, can have very productive consequences, because production not only benefits
from scale, it also benefits from the variety of inputs that are employed. To see this in concrete
terms, suppose that output is produced using a constant returns to scale technology that
includes as inputs intermediate goods as well as labor. If the quantity of labor as well as of all
existing varieties of intermediate inputs is doubled, then output doubles: this is just a feature
of constant returns to scale. This notion suggests that if the production budget is doubled,
output doubles too. Not so, simply because a doubling of all inputs is only one option under
a doubling of the budget. It is also possible to expand the variety of intermediate inputs that
are used in production. The option to expand variety leads to a situation where output more
than doubles: with input variety, increasing returns to scale is built in provided that the
underlying production function exhibits constant returns. It follows that the productivity
of the economy depends on the scale and richness of operations of the intermediate goods
sector.
To formalize this, suppose that an intermediate good — which we loosely call capital —- is
“produced” by means of several intermediate inputs (machines). Machines are indexed by
i: they appear on a continuum [0, ∞). The more machines are used, the more variety there
is in the production process, but all machines are used ina symmetric way. the easiest way
to capture this is to suppose that
(3.19) X =
"Z n
0
x(i)
1−
1
σ di#σ/(σ−1)
where n is an index of the variety of machines or the roundaboutness of production, and
σ > 1 proxies the degree of substitution across machines. This is like a CES production
function where the elasticity of substitution exceeds 1 (so that no one machine is necessary
in the production process).
Suppose that capital is produced by means of a “budget” K which can be used — at a
normalized price of one — to produce intermediate inputs. Then by strict concavity of the
production function in (3.19) and the symmetry of the problem, the budget would be equally
divided among available machines, so that K = xn would solve for x, the quantity of each
machine used in the production process. Consequently,
(3.20) X = {n (K/n)
(σ−1)/σ}
σ/(σ−1) = n
1/(σ−1)K.
It is in this sense that variety can be equated with total factor productivity.
We are now in a position to see how this leads to multiple equilibria. Suppose that the
economy is “poor” and exhibits a low demand for the final product. This situation means
that intermediate production cannot occur at an economically viable scale, which means
that the prices of intermediate goods are high. Consequently, firms substitute away from
intermediate goods to the use of raw labor. This lowers productivity because of the argument
Expectations and Multiple Equilibrium 27
in the previous paragraph and generates low income in the economy. Low income in turn
generates a low demand for the final good, and the vicious cycle is complete. The other side
of the coin is a virtuous circle. High demand for the final consumption good increases the
demand for intermediates, and because these intermediates are produced under conditions
of increasing returns to scale, prices of intermediates fall. Falling prices encourage a further
substitution away from labor to intermediates, which raises the productivity of the economy.
Incomes rise as a consequence and so does demand, completing the virtuous circle.
A formalization follows, based on Ciccone and Matsuyama [1996].
The idea of this exercise is to endogenize the degree of roundaboutness in production (notice
in passing that the same kind of analysis can be carried out using variety in consumption).
To this end, we suppose that each of the machine sectors must be set up (with a fixed cost of S,
denominated in terms of labor) before production can commence. Thereafter production of
machines takes place under constant returns to scale (see description below). Each machine
sector is run by a monopolist, but since different machines can — in principle — be very
close substitutes in production, there are limitations on his pricing behavior. This is what
we begin by exploring.
Imagine that varieties [0, n] are in force. Then producers of the final good will demand a
quantity x(i) of machine i, chosen to

Of course, the input i is of measure 0 but the following calculation can easily be justified by

Now turn attention to machine producers. Suppose that machines are produced using labor
alone, and that a units of labor are needed to produce one unit of a machine. Then the
marginal cost of producing y units of a machine is given by way, where w is the wage rate.

You should check that the first-order conditions characterizing this problem are necessary
and sufficient. They are
(1 − σ)p(i)
−σ + waσp(i)
−σ−1 = 0,
or
p(i) =

σ − 1
.
To make things easier to write, choose units of labor so that a = 1 − (1/σ); then
(3.22) p(i) = w for all i.
Before we go on to determine varieties, think of what it will now cost to buy one unit of the
composite capital X, given that this price determination process is in place. Recall that the
composite is
X =
"Z n
0
x(i)
(σ−1)/σdi#σ/(σ−1)
= n
σ/(σ−1)x,
because the same amount of every machine is bought given the pricing rule (3.22). So the
effective price of X — call it P — is given by
P =
cost of buying X
X
=
pnx
n
σ/(σ−1)x
=
w

1/(σ−1) .
Thus P/w — the effective relative factor price — is equal to n
1/(1−σ)
, which is declining in n.
So if F is CRS and we denote by α ≡
FX(X,L)X
F(X,L)
the factor share of X in production, then
(3.23) α = α(n
1/(1−σ)
) ≡ A(n).
If the elasticity of substitution between X and L exceeds unity, A(n) is an increasing function
(it is flat if F is Cobb-Douglas).
Now we return to the problem of determining equilibrium variety. Denoting the value of
final output by Y, the operating profit for a producer of intermediates is given by
π = (p − aw)x = px(1 − a) =
px
σ
=
αY
σn
,
where the second equality follows from the pricing rule p = w, the third equality from the
choice of labor units, and the last inequality from the fact that αY = npx by definition of
factor share. Thus
(3.24) π =
A(n)
n
Y
σ
.
Equation (3.24) tells us that an increase in variety has three effects on the operating profit of
a typical producer of intermediates:
Expectations and Multiple Equilibrium 29
[1] A larger n increases variety and this decreases the share to each variety (this is the 1/n
term).
[2] A larger n affects the factor share of intermediates, generally in a positive direction (this
is the A(n) term).
[3] A larger n affects final output (and therefore national income).
Now let us go ahead and finish the endogenization of n using the free-entry condition:
π =

or

wS =

wS =

wS .
Now observe that L + anx = (T − nS), where T is the total labor endowment in the economy,
and π is simply equal to wS. Using these in the equation above, we conclude that
(3.25) nσ
A(n)

.
This expression tells us that the potential for multiplicity is intimately linked to the behavior
of n/A(n) — to its possible nonmonotonicity in n, to be more accurate. For instance, in the
Cobb-Douglas case, A(n) is a constant as we have already seen, so that there is a unique
level of product variety in the economy. On the other hand, if A(n) increases sharply with
n (at least over some range), then the complementarity is strong and multiple equilibria are
indeed possible.
3.4.6 Complementarity and Finance. The focus in this section is not so much the idea
of multiple equilibria as the notion of how externalities might permeate the development
process through different channels. In this section we study the financial sector.
It is well known that financial deepening is one of the characteristics of the development
process. The introduction of money into a subsistence economy opens up opportunities
for trade that never existed before. Similarly, the expansion of the credit system opens up
new opportunities for investment, and this is taken one step further when a stock market
comes into being. Now, the investment-enhancing effects of financial deepening are well
worth studying, but we concentrate here on a slightly different set of questions: how is the
availability of finance (from end-savers) tied to the extent of financial deepening?
The answer that we would like to explore is that financial deepening offers opportunities for
diversification, and this encourages a greater flow of savings from low-risk (but low-return)
activities to the higher-risk (but higher-return) sectors. To be sure, the greater flow permits,
in its turn, greater deepening of the financial market. This is the phenomenon explored in
this section (we draw on Acemoglu and Zilibotti [1997]).
Notice that if each sector costs nothing to set up, then large amounts of diversification can
be achieved even with small amounts of finance by simply spreading the available finance
arbitrarily thinly over the existing sectors. Thus the idea of setup costs (or more generally, a
nonconvexity) must enter the picture again.
30 Expectations and Multiple Equilibrium
Begin by looking at individual choices. Suppose that financial securities for different
production sectors are indexed by j ∈ [0, 1]. Sector j pays off a return of R if state j occurs.
States are realized with uniform probability on [0, 1].
Notice that our goal is not to examine the determinants of productivity in each sector (as we
did earlier), nor do we ascribe different rates of return to each production sector. The only
goal here is to examine diversification possibilities.
Suppose that a measure n of sectors is “open” at any particular date. Rearrange sectors so
that we can think of these as sectors in [0, n], where 0 ≤ n ≤ 1. Now an agent must assign
his current assets to a savings portfolio. Denote assets by A. The sectors available are all
these (of measure n), and a riskless sector which pays a return factor of r. That is, if an agent
assigns a fraction α of his savings to the risky portfolios, and owns a “density” f(j) of asset
j, his return in state j is
c(j) ≡ (1 − α)Ar + αAR f(j) if j ∈ [0, n],
(3.26) ≡ (1 − α)Ar if j < [0, n].
Assume for now that these returns are all consumed (later we outline a model that allows
for this as well as for other possibilities). Assume that the agent is risk-averse and that his
utility is given by the familiar functional:
Z 1
0
ln(c(j))dj.
Substituting in the value of c(j) from (3.26), we see that the agent’s objective is to choose α
and the density f(j) to maximize
(3.27) Z n
0
ln
[1 − α]Ar + αAR f(j)

dj + (1 − n) ln ([1 − α]Ar) ,
subject to the constraints that α ∈ [0, 1], f(j) = 0 for j > n, and R n
0
f(j)dj = 1.
The first thing to note about this maximization problem is that given any value of α, the
density f(j) must be uniform over [0, n]. This equalizes agent returns over all states in [0, n],
and by second-order stochastic dominance the agent must prefer this to any other allocation
over the risky portfolio. Consequently, our maximization problem reduces to the task of
finding α ∈ [0, 1] to maximize
(3.28) n ln 
[1 − α]Ar +
αAR
n

+ (1 − n) ln ([1 − α]Ar) .
Write down the first-order conditions for this to solve the problem (and verify the secondorder
conditions yourself):
R − rn
(1 − α)r +
αR
n
=
1 − n
1 − α
.
Rearrange this to get
(3.29) α =
(R − r)n
R − rn
Expectations and Multiple Equilibrium 31
Notice that α is increasing in n (simply differentiate (3.29)). This summarizes our intuition
that the greater the amount of financial deepening (as proxied by n), the the greater the
amount of savings coming into the (risky) financial sector.
Now we move away from the individual level to understand some more about the process
of opening new financial sectors. Specifically, we wish to caputure the possibility that some
sectors require certain minimum investment sizes in order to open, and that these can vary
from sector to sector. the easiest way to do this is to suppose that there is a function S(i)
defined on [0, 1] that captures the cost of opening a new sector i. We order sectors (this
will not be at variance with our previous ordering) so that S(i) is increasing — assume it is
smooth, with S(0) = 0.
The macroeconomic equilibrium at any one point of time can now be described.
Assuming that n sectors are open, investment per sector — as we have seen — is given by
the amount
αA
n
=
R − r
R − rn
A,
using (3.29) It follows that the equilibrium financial depth is given by
(3.30) R − r
R − rn
A = S(n).
To be sure, there may be multiple solutions to this equation for the usual reason that there
are multiple equilibria, but we are not going to pay this too much attention. The point that
we wish to emphasize is this — as long as there is no equilibrium that involves maximal depth
(n = 1), every equilibrium is Pareto-inefficient. There are externalities in the process that will
not go away, even if coordination failures are resolved.
To understand why, notice that the opening of a fresh sector confers positive benefits on
all agents, simply because of the diversification possibilities that are involved. However,
individual agents wish to equalize their holdings across sectors. This tendency towards
equalization means that sectors with large setup requirements cannot be accomodated. At
the margin, some accomodation must be beneficial. This is the source of the inefficiency.
To make this point more precisely, imagine a situation in which a social planner chooses not
only α and the portfolio for the representative agent in the economy, but also the value of n.
In other words, such a planner would actually maximize
(3.31) Z n
0
ln
[1 − α]Ar + αAR f(j)

dj + (1 − n) ln ([1 − α]Ar) ,
subject to all the constraints described after (3.27), and a suitable choice of n, under the
additional constraint that αA f(j) ≥ S(j) for all j ∈ [0, n].
The solution to this problem is a bit more complicated because of this last constraint. In
particular, equal division of the portfolio cannot be assured. But what we can say is this: if
αA f(j) > S(j)
over any interval of securities, then over that interval we must have equal division of the
portfolio. For if not, a second-order dominance move can be created without violating
any of the constraints. It follows that along some interval [0, n], we have equal division,
32 Expectations and Multiple Equilibrium
while possibly along an additional interval [n, n
∗
], we have portfolio holdings that exactly
compensate for the fixed cost of those sectors. So our maximization problem may be rewritten
as: choose n, n

(not less than n) and α ∈ [0, 1] to maximize
(3.32) n ln ([1 − α]Ar + S(n)R) +
Z n

and write down the Kuhn-Tucker conditions (we’ll only need to do so for the derivatives
with respect to n
∗ and n):
(3.34) ln ([1 − α]Ar + S(n
∗
)R) − ln ([1 − α]Ar) − λS(n

∗ > n,
and
(3.35) nS0
(n)R
[1 − α]Ar + S(n)R
− λnS0
(n) ≤ 0, with equality if n > 0.
Now the question is: is it ever possible for an equilibrium to satisfy the Kuhn-Tucker
conditions, which, as we know, are necessary for an optimum? [Never mind whether they
are sufficient.] The answer is no. To see this, notice that in an equilibrium, n > 0 (because
S(0) = 0). Consequently, (3.35) holds with equality, so that
λ =
R
[1 − α]Ar + S(n)R
.
Therefore, if n = n
∗
, (3.34) implies that
(3.36) ln ([1 − α]Ar + S(n)R) − ln ([1 − α]Ar) ≤
RS(n)
[1 − α]Ar + S(n)R
.
But this contradicts the strict concavity of the logarithmic function. We know that ln(y) −
ln(x) > (y − x)/y. Applying this to x = [1 − α]Ar and y = [1 − α]Ar + S(n)R, we may conclude
that
ln ([1 − α]Ar + S(n)R) − ln ([1 − α]Ar) >
RS(n)
[1 − α]Ar + S(n)R
,
which contradicts (3.36).
It follows that we must always have n
∗ > n in the social planning problem; that is, some
sectors must be “cross-subsidized”. But no agent wants to take up the burden of crosssubsidization!
Given that other agents are holding unequal portfolios in order to keep a
sector open, a given agent will always want to allocate his portfolio equally among the
sectors. To be sure, if all agents do so, some sectors will have to close down, perpetuating
the inefficiency.
Expectations and Multiple Equilibrium 33
Observe that the financial deepening problem has implications for the pace of development,
as well as its uncertainty. In countries with small asset levels (proxied by A), aggregate
development will be beset by frequent crises, as full insurance (diversification) is not possible.
Extend the model a little bit to recursively define A in each period in one of two ways:
[1] A is the product of savings decisions made by young agents who only earn a wage; the
wage is the marginal product of labor evaluated at the going capital stock of the economy.
Total returns to the financial sector constitute the amount of capital, which is ploughed
into the deterministic production of a final good, under an Inada-style production function.
Agents live two periods. This is the approach taken by Acemoglu-Zilibotti and this model
can be easily embedded into sucha dynamic model.
[2] A is the product of savings decisions made by long-lived agents, in which the log utility
function postulated here must be viewed as the value function of a dynamic program with
underlying utility functions also logarithmic. Income is then the sum of wages and capital
returns at any date. This is a bit more complicated as a dynamic program needs to be solved.
With either of these extensions, A will fluctuate for long periods of time at low levels (if one
starts low) until a certain asset level is reached that permits full or near-full diversification.
At this point the economy settles down to a steady rate of growth. Thus, while the ergodic
behavior of all economies is the same, the transitions can be very different: for a poor
economy, the steady state can be a long time coming.
Notice in conclusion that this is one view of history-dependence. Another has to do with
the possibility that long run behavior may also be different depending on initial conditions.
This is what we take up in coming sections of the course.

CHAPTER 4
History Versus Expectations
So far, we’ve discussed the existence of a virtuous circle of expectations that might lead
communities to Pareto-superior states among multiple potential equilibria. As we have
already noted, it is possible to think of these as generalized coordination games. Once the
game-theoretic analogy is pressed into service, however, certain troubling issues arise.
Rosenstein-Rodan and Hirschman were concerned with multiple equilibria, no question,
but this was only the starting point of their analysis. They took it as self-evident that history
somehow plays a role in pinning down the “starting equilibrium”, and that the role of policy
would be to construct ways of “moving” society from one equilibrium to another.
It is of interest to note that the theory of pure coordination games makes it very difficult,
if not impossible, to ask this question in a well-defined way. Imagine a sequence of such
situations. Suppose that a bad equilibrium outcome has been in force for the previous 100
plays of the game. In what sense does that make it more likely that in the 101st iteration,
the bad equilibrium will occur again? Formulated in this way, the answer must be: in no
sense at all. For as is well-known, all sorts of complicated switches between the good and
bad equilibria can actually constitute a perfect equilibrium of the repeated game. There is
no role for history in such a formulation.
Thus, by and large, this literature ignores a central question raised by Rosenstein-Rodan and
Hirschman: how does an economy “move from a bad to a good equilibrium”? We place this
entire phrase in quotes because it is imprecise: so called transitions from one “equilibrium”
to another must themselves be viewed as the equilibria of some encompassing intertemporal
process.
It appears (unless some convincing psychological model can be found that weds people to
the historical status quo) that some sort of state variable is needed to make sense of the
Rosenstein-Rodan/Hirschman argument. [This will also serve as a tentative introduction to
the next part of the course in which such state variables, such as initial inequalities, are strong
enough to pin down a unique equilibrium.] But the state variable must be introduced in
some “economical way”, that does not rule out — by fiat or by assumption — the possibility
of moving to a new equilibrium.
36 History Versus Expectations
In what follows, we look at some different approaches to the question of equilibrium-picking
when there is potential coordnation failure.
4.1 State Variables and Common Knowledge
The first avenue that we explore is due to Morris and Shin (1998) (see also Carlsson and
Van Damme (1993)). The basic idea is very simple and very powerful. Suppose that a
coordination game is played between several agents — we shall write a concrete one down
in a moment — and that the realization of a state variable affects the payoffs. Suppose that
for certain values of the state variable the play of one action or the other is a dominant
strategy, but for other values of the state there is a coordination problem. If the realization
of the state variable is common knowledge, there is no bite at all in introducing the state
variable: each realization of the state precipitates a different game, and each game is played
separately.
But suppose that there isn’t common knowledge of the realizations. Suppose that we all
see the realized value with a bit of noise. Then I know that you have seen something, but
you may have seen something a bit different from me. Now there isn’t a string of separate
games for each realization of the state variable. The implications can be surprising, as the
following model of financial crises reveals.
Consider a country which has pegged its exchange rate at some value e. (For concreteness,
think of e as the number of dollars required to buy one unit of the domestic currency.) We
shall assume that this exchange rate is unambiguously overvalued, in the following sense:
suppose that there is some random variable θ (the state) on [0, 1] which determines the “true”
exchange rate f(θ) were the currency to be allowed to float at θ. Then e always exceeds f(θ)
for all θ ∈ [0, 1].
But θ also influences the exchange rate: which is to say that f(θ) varies with θ. Arrange
so that f(θ) is strictly increasing in θ. So the idea is that θ is some “fundamental” which
influences the country’s capacity to export or import, or to attract investment; the higher
being θ, the more favorable the climate.
Now there is a bunch of speculators (of total measure 1), each of whom can sell one unit
of the local currency. If they do, they pay a transactions cost t. If the government holds
the peg, the exchange rate stays where it is, and this is the payoff to selling: −t. If the
government abandons the peg, then the speculators make a profit of e − f(θ), so their net
payoff is e − f(θ) − t.
What about the government’s decisions? It has only one decision to make: whether to
abandon or to retain the peg. We assume that it will abandon the peg if the measure of
speculators exceeds a(θ), where a is increasing in θ (that is, if the basic health of the economy
is better, the government is more reluctant to abandon1
).
1
See Morris and Shin (1998) for a very simple account of how to derive a(θ) from a somewhat more basic starting
point.
History Versus Expectations 37
We will assume that there is some positive value of θ, call it
¯
θ, such that below
¯
θ the situation
is so bad that the government will abandon the peg anyway. In other words we are assuming
that a(θ) = 0 for θ ∈ [0,
¯
θ]. Then it rises but always stays less than one by assumption.
Consider, now, a second threshold for θ which we’ll call θ¯: this is the point above which no
one wants to sell the currency even though she feels that the government will abandon the
peg for sure. In other words, θ¯ solves the equation
(4.1) e − f(θ¯) − t = 0.
We will assume that such a θ¯, strictly less than one, indeed exists. But we also suppose that
there is a gap between
¯
θ and θ¯: that
¯
θ < θ¯.
[If there were no such gap, there wouldn’t be a coordination problem to start with.]
Now we are ready to begin our discussion of this model. First assume that the realization of
θ is perfectly observed by all agents, and that this information is common knowledge. Then
there are obviously three cases to consider.
Case 1. θ ≤
¯
θ. In this case, the government will abandon the peg for sure. The economy is
not viable, all speculators must sell, and a currency crisis occurs.
Case 2. θ ≥ θ¯. In this case no speculator will attack the currency, and the peg will hold for
sure.
Case 3.
¯
θ < θ < θ¯. Obviously this is the interesting case, in which multiple equilibria obtain.
There is an equilibrium in which no one attacks, and the government maintains the peg.
There is another equilibrium in which everyone attacks and the government abandons the
peg. This is a prototype of the so-called second-generation financial crises models, in which
expectations — over and above fundamentals — play an important role (see Obstfeld (1994,
1996)).
So much for this standard model, variants of which we have already seen in excruciating
detail. Now we drop the common knowledge of realizations (but we will maintain the
assumption of common knowledge of the information structure that I am going to write
down).
Suppose that θ is distributed uniformly on [0, 1]: its value will be known perfectly at the
time the government decides whether or not to hold the peg or to abandon it. Initially,
however, the realization of θ is noisy in the following sense: each individuals sees a signal
x which is distributed uniformly on [θ − , θ + ], for some tiny  > 0 (where θ is the true
realization). Conditional on the realization of θ, this additional noise is iid across agents.
Proposition 4.1. There is a unique value of the signal x such that an agent attacks the currency if
x < x
∗
and does not attack if x > x
∗
.
This is an extraordinary result in the sense that a tiny amount of noise refines the equilibrium
map considerably. Notice that as  → 0, we are practically at the common knowledge limit
(or are we? the question of what sort of convergence is taking place is delicate and important
here), yet there is no “zone” of multiple equilibria! The equilibrium is unique.
38 History Versus Expectations
What is central to the argument is the “infection” created by the lack of common knowledge
(of realizations). To see this, we work through a proof of Proposition 4.1, with some informal
discussion.
Start by looking at the point
¯
θ − . Suppose that someone receives a signal x of this value or
less. What is she to conclude? She doesn’t know what everyone else has seen, but she does
know that the signal is distributed around the truth with support of size 2. This means that
the true realization cannot exceed
¯
θ, so that the government will abandon the peg for sure.
So she will sell. That is, we’ve shown that for all
x ≤ x0 ≡
¯
θ − ,
it is dominant to sell.
Now pick someone who has a signal just bigger than x0. What does he conclude? Suppose,
for now, he makes the assumption that only those with signals less than x0 are selling; no one
else is. Now what is the chance — given his own signal x — that someone else has received
a signal not exceeding x0? To see this, first note that the true θ must lie in [x − , x + ]. For
each such θ the chances that the signal for someone else is below x0 is (1/2)[x0 − (θ − )],
so the overall chances are just these probabilities integrated over all conceivable values of θ,
which yields (1/2)[x0 − (x − )]. So the “infection” spreads: if x is close to x0, these chances
are close to 1/2. In this region, moreover, it is well known that the government’s threshold
is very low: close to zero sellers (and certainly well less than half the population) will cause
an abandonment of the peg. Knowing this, such an x must sell. Knowing that all with signals
less than x0 must sell, we have deduced something stronger: that some signals above x0 must create
sales as well.
So let us proceed recursively: Suppose we have satisfied ourselves that for some index n,
everyone sells if the signal is no bigger than xn (we already know this for x0). We define xn+1
as the largest value of the signal for which people will want to sell, knowing that all below
xn are selling.
This is a simple matter to work out. Fix x ≥ xn, and imagine any θ ∈ [x − , x + ]. For such
θ, everybody with a signal between θ −  and xn (such an interval may be empty, of course)
will attack, by the recursive assumption. Because these are the only attackers (also by the
recursive assumption), the government will yield iff
1
2
[xn − (θ − )] ≥ α(θ),
or
θ + 2a(θ) ≤ xn + 
So we can define an implicit function h(x, ) such that the above inequality translates into
θ ≤ h(xn, ).
Put another way, the implicit function h(x, ) solves the equation
(4.2) h(x, ) + 2a(h(x, )) = x + 
History Versus Expectations 39
It follows that if our person with signal x were to attack, her expected payoff would be given
by
(4.3) 1
2
Z h(xn,)
x−
[e − f(θ)]dθ − t.
Now retrace the recursion starting all the way from n = 0: we have x0 =
¯
θ − . Then
(remembering that a(θ) = 0 for all θ ≤
¯
θ) it is easy to see that (4.3) reduces to
1
2
Z

x−
[e − f(θ)]dθ − t.
For x ' x0, this is just
1

Z

θ−2
[e − f(θ)]dθ − t,
which is certainly strictly positive. So x1 is well-defined, and x1 > x0.
Now put x1 in place of x0, and repeat the process. Notice that h is increasing in x, so if we
replace x0 by x1 in (4.3), then, evaluated at x = x1, the payoff must turn strictly positive.2
So the new x2, which is the maximal signal for which people will sell under the belief that
everyone less than x1 sells, will be still higher than x1. And so on: the recursion creates a
strictly increasing sequence {xn}, which converges from below to x

It is very easy to see that there is a unique solution to x

[e − f(θ)]dθ − t < 0.
To prove this, consider any x
0 > x
∗
. Then two things happen: first, it is easy to see that
h(x
0
, ) − x
0 < h(x
∗
, ) − x
∗
,
so that the support over which integration takes place in (4.4) is narrowed. Moreover, the
stuff insidethe integral is also smaller when we move from x
∗
to x
0
, because f(θ) is increasing.
So the LHS of (4.4) unambiguously falls when we move from x
∗
to x
0
, and we are done with
the Claim.
To learn a bit more about x

2This is on the assumption that the sequence {xn} stays bounded below θ¯. This will certainly be the case, see
below, so it’s not really an assumption at all.
40 History Versus Expectations
A comnparison of this equation with (4.1) categorically shows that x
∗
is bounded below θ¯
for small .
So there is a unique solution to x
∗ and it is below θ¯, which justifies the previous recursive
analysis (see in particular, footnote 2). Notice also that our analysis shows that every
equilibrium must involve attack for signals less than x
∗
.
To complete the proof, we must show that no signal above x
∗
can ever attack. Suppose,
on the contrary, that in some equilibrium some signal above x
∗ finds it profitable to attack.
Take the supremum of all signals under which it is weakly profitable to attack: call this x
0
.
Then at x
0
it is weakly profitable to attack. Suppose we now entertain a change in belief
by supposing that everybody below x
0 attacks for sure; then this cannot change the weak
profitability of attack at x
0
. But the profit is

which is nonnegative as we’ve just argued. But this contradicts the Claim.
So we have proved that there is a unique equilibrium to the “perturbed” game, in which a
speculative attack is carried out by an individual if and only if x ≤ x
∗
. As  → 0, this has
an effect of refining the equilibrium correspondence dramatically. To describe this, calculate
the threshold x
∗ as  → 0. The easiest way to do this is the “sandwich” inequality:
[e − f(h(x

[e − f(θ)]dθ ≤ [e − f(h(x

which is obtained by noting that f(x
∗ − ) ≤ f(θ) ≤ f(h(x
∗

sides of the sandwich go to the same limit, because x
∗ and h(x

of the state — all go to a common limit, call it θ
∗
. This limit solves the condition
(4.6) [e − f(θ

It is obvious that there is a unique solution to (4.6).
Note: At this point be careful when reading Morris-Shin. There is an error in Theorem 2.
See Heinemann (AER 2000) for a correction of this error which agrees with the calculations
provided here.
4.2 Lagged Externalities
The use of a state variable which may change the fortunes of one sector versus another
(irrespective of sectoral membership) at any one point of time is a useful way of thinking about
(relatively) short-run episodes such as financial crises. It may not be as useful when thinking
about a country or region which is stuck in some low-investment trap for long periods of
time. It is much harder to conceive of a state variable that will signal positive profitability for
the high-investment outcome (regardless of the actions of other investors) in any one period.
In what follows, we take two approaches; one that dispenses with this sort of state variables
altogether (Adsera and Ray [1998]; this section) and one that resurrects state variables, but `

has them follow a Markov process (possibly with small local support) over time (Frankel
and Pauzner [2001]; next section).
Suppose that an economy has two regions, A and B. A total capital (or labor) endowment
of K¯ is split at date 0 between the two regions. Denote by K the capital in region B, so that
K¯ − K is the capital stock in region A. Capital invested in Region A yields a fixed rate of
return, normalized to zero. Region B’s rate of return r is taken to depend positively on its
capital endowment:
(4.7) r = f(K)
where f is continuous, strictly increasing, and f(0) < 0 < f(K¯).
Imagine that there is a continuum of agents, and each agent owns a single unit of capital.
Capital is free to move between regions but each relocation entails a nonnegative cost.
This model may be conveniently summarized by using a simple diagram.
Figure 4.1 shows us the two sectors. In A the rate of return is flat at the (normalized) level
zero. In B, the return to any one individual to participating in a sector depends positively
on the number of individuals already active in that sector (starting below zero and ending
above). To complete the description, we locate the initial allocation of individuals across the
two sectors (given by history). This is given by OA people in A and OB people in B. You
could think of the line segment AB as the total number of people in the economy: as the
allocation of people changes, the only thing that alters is the position of AB but not its length.
Now, the initial allocation of people has been chosen to deliberately illustrate a point. Even
though B is, in principle, “better” than A (if everyone were in B the rate of return would
42 History Versus Expectations
exceed that of A), at the starting location, the actual rate of return in A exceeds the actual rate
of return in B.
Note that our examples discussed so far fit in quite neatly into this framework. For instance,
the return in B could be interpreted as the wages paid to people who have decided to acquire
a certain set of skills, as a function of the number of individuals who have already acquired such
skills. In this interpretation, if you were to think of the alternative occupation as conferring
no externalities, you might imagine that the rate-of-return line in A as nearly flat, while the
one in B slopes upwards. Or you could think of B as typewriters with the Dvorak system,
or for that matter as alternative chip designs, while A contains the QWERTY typewriters,
or Intel chips. The rate of return is then to be interpreted as the total amount of satisfaction
accruing to a consumer or user, net of the cost of purchase or usage. In all these examples,
it might be useful to think of OA as a large segment, while OB is very small, perhaps zero.
Now we are ready to make this model run. Imagine that, as indicated in Figure 4.1, the rate
of return in A exceeds the corresponding rate in B. Then, as time passes, individuals will
gravitate from B to A. This describes the failure of of an exciting new sector when there is
enough critical mass to keep the momentum going. Matters will end with everybody in A
and nobody in B.
Figure 4.1 also reveals that if there had been sufficient critical mass, matters could have been
entirely different. For instance, suppose that initial history initially put us at the allocation
OA0 and OB0
, where the rates of returns in the two sectors are exactly equal. Then the
slightest additional tilt towards B can spark off an accelerating tempo of beneficial change,
as people switch over to the new technology (or the new product, or a new way of life).
Now here is a different story that works entirely on the basis of expectations. Begin again in
the situation where OA individuals are in A, while the rest, OB, are in B. Now imagine that
for some reason, everybody believes that everybody else will be in B tomorrow. Never mind
where this belief came from. Simply note that if this belief is genuinely held by someone, he
must also believe that B is the sector to be in, because the return there is higher. Consequently,
he will gravitate to B tomorrow. But if everybody thinks the same way, everybody will be
in B, and the seemingly absurd belief is completely justified (provided that the one-time
cost of moving is not too high, of course). Thus, it would seem from this argument that
history plays no role at all. Irrespective of initial conditions, there are only two self-justifying
outcomes that are possible, everyone in A or everyone in B, and that both these outcomes are
always possible, depending only on expectations.3 How do we square this story with the
one that we described earlier?
To analyze this, we enrich both the switching cost specification as well as the intertemporal
structure of the externality.
In all that follows, regard K as the amount of capital in Sector B, so that K¯ − K is the amount
of capital in Sector A. Assume that the cost of moving from B to A is given by a function
cˆA(K) and that the cost of moving from A to B is given by some function cˆB(K). Say that
either of these cost functions exhibits congestion if it increases, at least over some interval, in

possible to rule this out on grounds of “stability”.

the capital in the relevant sector. That is, cˆA exhibits congestion if it is decreasing over some
range, while cˆB does so if it is increasing over some range.
Before we describe agent behavior, let us track the relevant prices. Let γ ≡ {r(t), cA(t), cB(t)}
∞
t=0
be some point expectation about the path (measurable in time) of returns and relocation costs
in each region. Future returns are discounted in the standard way, using a discount rate ρ.
Denote by V(γ, i, t) the optimal value to an agent in region i, i = A, B, beginning at time t, when
the commonly anticipated path of returns is γ. Then by standard dynamic programming
arguments, an agent in region i will switch sectors at time t if V(γ, i, t) < V(γ, j, t) − cj(t), will
stay if the opposite inequality holds, and will be indifferent if equality holds.
A path γ is an equilibrium if it is generated by the optimal decisions of (almost) all agents in
response to γ.
To discuss the generation of γ, consider now some exogenously given measurable path
{K(t)}
∞
t=0
(recall the interpretation that K(t) is the amount of capital in sector B).4 We assume
that there is some lag (however small) in the speed at which external effects induced by
incoming/outgoing factors affect the going rates of return. From this point of view, we
regard the return function f(K) as representing a “long run level” of the rate of return, once
the economy has settled at a certain level of capital K. We assume that at date 0, r(0) is
precisely f(K(0)) (see (4.7)). Thereafter, we introduce an increasing function g, with g(0) = 0,
such that
(4.8) r˙(t) = g(f(K(t)) − r(t)).
Thus, the rate of return at any date “chases” the “appropriate” rate of return corresponding
to the division of the capital endowment at that date. The specific functional form of g(.)
determines the speed at which returns adjust. In any case, capital owners will get paid r(t)
at date t.
Thus a path of capital allocations {K(t)} generates a path of returns {r(t)} using (4.8), and a
path {cA(t), cB(t)} using the relationships cB(t) = cˆB(K(t)) and cA(t) = cˆA(K¯ − K(t)) for all t.
Several economic situations conform quite naturally to this specification. In models of
search or matching, the productivity of some fixed amount of capital may depend on the
ability of that capital to find partners (with more capital), say, because of minimum scale
requirements in production. This ability, in turn, will depend on the total amount of capital
in the economy (see, e.g., Diamond [1982]). Note that a discontinuous jump in the capital
stock will lead to a smooth intertemporal increase in productivity as long as the process
of “matching partners” takes place in continuous time. Likewise, if one replaces “capital”
by “population” and “rate of return” by “utility”, the concentration of population in a
particular geographical region may provoke large amounts of productive activity and a
variety of goods and services, attracting still more people because of the greater utility to be
had (Krugman [1991b]). Again, the degree of productive activity might react smoothly to
4Note that we do not a priori restrict {K(t)} to be a continuous path, so that self-fulfilling “jumps” are, in principle,
permitted.
44 History Versus Expectations
a sudden influx of population (perhaps because the information regarding a larger market
needs time to permeate to all the producers).
Say that an intertemporal equilibrium is exclusively history dependent if the long-run outcome
either equals the initial allocation, or entails migration only to the sector that is initially
profitable. Note that myopic tatonnement has the same properties, though obviously the
exact path may be different. The main similarity is that no room is left for farsighted
expectations.
Proposition 4.2. Assume f(K(0)) , 0. Unless the cost of relocation exhibits congestion, every
equilibrium must be exclusively history dependent, irrespective of the discount rate.
This observation is independent of the magnitude of discounting, and of the degree of
responsiveness of returns (as long as it is not instantaneous). Thus by a minor and reasonable
weakening of one of the assumptions in the literature, we obtain a class of models where
expectations are dwarfed by history, where initial conditions determine the final equilibrium.
Of course, if rates of return adjust instantaneously, then expectations-driven equilibria are
possible.
We reiterate: our claim is not that ahistorical equilibria are impossible. But that, in this
class of models, in addition to the intersectoral agglomeration externalities, the “migration
technology”, is crucial to understand the sources of such equilibria. The only way in which
such outcomes can occur is by introducing a cost to postponement; i.e., by making future
relocation costs increase in the stock of settlers in our case.
Proof of Proposition 4.2. Consider the case in which f(K(0)) < 0. The case f(K(0)) > 0 can
be settled by a parallel argument.
Fix any equilibrium γ. We claim that K(t) ≤ K(s) for all t ≥ s, which settles exclusive
history-dependence.
Suppose this is false. Then, indeed, there is some t and s with t > s, and exhibiting the
following features:
a. K(t) > K(s).
b. r(τ) < 0 for all τ ∈ [s, t].
c. Some agent moves to sector B at date s.
d. The moving agent does not return to A until after date t.
Part (a) is simply the negation of our proposition. Part (b) follows from the fact that returns
adjust continuously, and that r(0) < 0. Part (c) follows from the fact that K cannot begin to
climb unless there is movement from A to B. And Part (d) follows from Part (b): there is no
point in someone going to B and coming back while the returns there are strictly negative
throughout.
Now consider our moving agent at date s and have her move at date t instead, following
thereafter her original optimal strategy (by (d), this is possible). Then her deviation return,
History Versus Expectations 45
discounted by ρ to date s, is given by
(4.9) e
−ρ(t−s)
[V(γ, B, t) − cB(K(t))],
while along the presumed optimum it is (once again discounted to s)

(4.10) [V(γ, B, t) − cB(K(t))],
where the first inequality follows from Part (b), the third from discounting, and the last from
the no-congestion assumption.
But together, (4.9) and (4.10) yield a contradiction.
4.3 State Variables and Time
We now resurrect state variables but in a way that concentrates on the possibly long-term
nature of the coordination problem (as in Adsera-Ray and in contrast to Morris-Shin). (The `
material here is based on Frankel and Pauzner [2001].) As in the previous sections, we
assume that in every period there is a coordination game to be played. However, we will
take the return in Sector B to depend, not just on the amount of K in that sector, but also on
some exogenous state variable zt
. Thus we write f(K, z) for the return in that sector, while
the return in sector A is normalized to zero just as before. Without loss of any generality
assume that f is increasing in z (the realization of the random variable zt at date t).
The idea is that zt
is some random variable which is changing over time and is exogenous
to the model at hand. For example, it could be the price of oil, which makes the industrial
sector B relatively less or more attractive than the agricultural sector A.
The first main assumption on z is that it follows some nondegenerate stochastic process with
no trend. So the increments to z all look the same, no matter what the starting level. The
second assumption is a joint one on f and z: there are values of z (in its overall support,
which you can think of as the entire real line) so that it pays for everyone to be in Sector B
today no matter what happens in the future, and no matter how many people are in Sector
B today. Likewise, there are values of z so low that the opposite is true: it is worth being in
Sector A today no matter what happens in the future.
Like the previous model, this one is easier to do in continuous time. Let ρ be the discount
factor of the agents. The former assumption can be formally expressed as
(4.11) E
"Z ∞

for some z¯ in the support of the random variable. The latter assumption can be expressed as

for some

z in the support of the random variable.
Notice that this model emphatically does not rule out the multiple equilibrium problem. The
assumptions embodied in (4.11) and (4.12) only rule out the problem for extreme and possibly
very low-probability values that zt might take on at some later date. For “most” intermediate
values of z, there should be a genuine coordination problem as before: my behavior will
depend, in principle, on what I anticipate others to do, now and in the future.
To describe behavior a bit more clearly, let us specify the model a bit further. We shall
suppose that there is no cost of moving, but that everybody gets the chance to move at
some point according to a Poisson process with independent arrivals. Thus each person is
arbitrarily and randomly given the chance to move (she may not exercise this right, however).
The remainder are stuck in whichever sector they may happen to be in that instant. All
moves are made under the asumption of rational expectations and full intertemporal utility
maximization, just as in the previous model.
Proposition 4.3. In the infinite-horizon moving game, there is a function ˆk(z) such that everyone
who has a chance to move at any date, chooses sector B when k > ˆk(z), chooses Sector A when k < ˆk(z),
and is indifferent when k = ˆk(z). The specific nature of the function ˆk will depend on the data of the
problem.
The proposition states that despite the potential scope for multiple equilibria, history once
again fully pins down the outcome (but in a completely different way from the previous
exercise). The extreme values that z can conceivably assume somehow serve to pin down
behavior in the intermediate (more likely) zone.
Understanding this proposition teaches us something subtle about the role of beliefs in
equilibrium models, so it is worthwhile to go through the details. To emphasize the
nontriviality of this proposition, it may be worth considering — just for a moment —
the case in which z does not change at all over time (see Figure 4.2). This sort of diagram will
be repeated more than once so let us get used to it. On the horizontal axis are various values
of z; in particular, the threshold values of z¯ and
¯
z are clearly marked. On the vertical axis
are different values of the capital stock in Sector B. The maximum such value is obviously
K¯; this is marked as well.
You are to interpret both these values as current values. [Of course, this injunction is irrelevant
for z at the moment because its value is fixed, but it will become relevant later.]
The diagram also contains two downward-sloping lines. The first of these lines — call it
line I — depicts the combinations of (K, z) values such that if Sector B starts with K, and then
gains capital whenever people get a chance to move, the present discounted value of sector B
is zero. Formally, this first line is the collection of all (K, z) pairs such that

Figure 4.2. Boundaries for Multiple Equilibria when z is Fixed.
Notice that as z goes up, this makes returns better for Sector B, so that the threshold value
of K needed to sstisfy the condition goes down. This is why the line is downward-sloping.
The second line — call it line II — describes the combinations of (K, z) values such that if
Sector B starts with K, and then loses capital whenever people get a chance to move, the
present discounted value of sector B is zero. Formally, this first line is the collection of all
(K, z) pairs such that

Line II is downward-sloping for the same reason that line I is. In addition, it should be
obvious that line II must lie to the right of line I, as it imposes zero profits for Sector B on the
basis of more pessimistic expectations about that sector.
Now notice that lines I and II mark out demarcations for unique and multiple equilibria. If
the system finds itself to the right of line II, everybody must move to B when they get the
chance. Likewise, if the system finds itself to the left of line I, everyone must move to A
when they get the chance. But between lines I and II the situation is up for grabs. Because
such a configuration is to the left of line II, it is possible to speculate that if everyone flees
for Sector A, then a particular agent must too (when she gets the chance to move). This is
self-fulfilling. Similarly, because the configuration is to the right of line I, one can sustain the
opposite movement in this zone. Multiple equilibria are not ubiquitous (for extreme values
of z there is only one equilibrium), but they haven’t vanished, not by a long shot.

So much for the case in which the value of z is exogenously given. Now let’s suppose that z
follows a Markov process as described above. Figure 4.3 starts this analysis by drawing the
analogue of line II: the one with pessimistic expectations from the point of view of Sector
B. I say “analogue” because the earlier description took z to be given; now we have to
take expectations over changes in z as well. Formally, we look at all pairs of points (k, z) —
forming the locus k(z, 0) — such that
(4.13) E

where Kt
is the “pessimistic process” in which individuals move to A whenever they get the
chance, and zt
is the exogenous stochastic process starting from z0 = z.
The locus k(z, 0) is the analogue of line II, and it is downward-sloping for exactly the same
reason. But now matters get interesting just to the left of this locus. The pessimistic
expectation: can it be validated? It can if z is fixed, but now it is possible that tomorrow,
z might increase, taking the whole system into the area right of k(z, 0). In that case we
know that whoever gets a chance to move will not move to A. So expectations that are fully
pessimistic are inconsistent with what we already know about the model, at least with some
probability. Let us modify, then, our process K to say that it pessimistically moves down
(as before) except under the above contingency. But now this makes Sector B a bit more
attractive than it was when constructing the locus k(z, 0). It follows that the new zero-payoff
locus associated with these somewhat brighter expectations — call it k(z, 1) — must be to the
left of k(z, 0) (see Figure 4.3).
This starts an iteration. Even k(z, 1) must be too pessimistic, because the prospects of moving
to B are brighter than those described by k(z, 0). In general, define k(z, n + 1) to be the locus

of all (k, z) points which make people indifferent between Sectors A and B, assuming that
whenever the system is to the right of k(z, n) people will move to B, and will move to A otherwise.
[Because z has a density, we don’t have to worry about what happens if we land right on
k(z, n).] All these loci are downward-sloping, and they converge to some limit which we
shall call k
∗
(z). This limit locus has the following properties:
[1] If the system is to the right of this locus, everyone who has a chance to move at that point
must move to Sector B.
[2] If the system is to the left of this locus, matters are ambiguous. Certainly, if everyone
is expected to go to A whenever the system is to the left of k
∗
(z), then they will do so. But
there is no ruling out multiple equilibria yet. It may be that points to the left of k
∗
(z) are also
consistent with a move to B.
So we need to continue the analysis, and to do so we start an iteration from the left this time.
The iteration is not going to be entirely symmetric, so pay attention to what follows.
First, we translate the locus k(z, 0) way over to the left. Figure 4.4 illustrates. By our
assumption on extreme values, I can find, in fact, a translate that is so far over that for every
(k, z) on that (translated) locus,
(4.14) E

where Kt
is now the “optimistic process” in which individuals move to B whenever they get
the chance, and zt
is the exogenous stochastic process starting from z0 = z. That is, these
values of z are so bad for sector B that despite the harbouring of optimistic expectations
50 History Versus Expectations
about future moves to Sector B, it is best to stay in Sector A. In this way, we have identified
a sufficient condition for moves to Sector A to always constitute an equilibrium: that (k, z) be
to the left of this translated locus; call it k
0
(z, 0).
But now, once again, we know that these optimistic predictions are too optimistic. People
won’t always move to B; in fact, as we have just seen, if the state moves into the extreme
left zone that we have just identified, they will move to A (or stay there, as the case may
be). Thus we can define a fresh collection of (k, z) with the property that starting from each
of these points and entertaining the optimistic expectation except when the state wanders to
the left of k
0
(z, 0), state A is weakly better. Figure 4.4 shows the boundary of this set as a
dotted line to the right of k
0
(z, 0).
Now iterate as follows: translate the locus k
0
(z, 0) — to the right this time — as far as possible,
subject to the condition that no part of it wander out of the dotted line (see Figure 4.4 to
follow this fully). This translation we will call k
0
(z, 1). More generally, continue the iteration
as follows: given k
0
(z, n), consider the collection of all (k, z) points which make people weakly
prefer Sector A to B, assuming that whenever the system is to the right of k0
(z, n) people will move to
B, and will move to A otherwise. Having done so, define k
0
(z, n + 1) to be the furthest translate
of k
0
(z, n) subject to the constraint that it fully lies within the set of points defined in the
previous sentence. Let k∗(z) denote the limit of this recursion.
Appreciate again that this iteration is different from the first one. It has a similar flavor, but
we only restrict ourselves to translates. Nevertheless, we can certainly say that for all points
to the left of k∗(z), it is a dominant strategy to move to sector A (after all, we have been — if
anything — “conservative” towards A when performing this iteration).
Now we need to look at points on the locus a bit more carefully. Notice that the first limit —
k
∗
(z) — certainly has the property that on k∗
(z), one is indifferent between A and B , provided
we assume everyone moves to B on the right of this locus, and towards A on the left of this
locus. But because we have thrown away some points in doing the second iteration, we
cannot say the same of k∗(z). All we can say is that if we assume everyone moves to B on the
right of k∗(z), and towards A on the left of k∗(z), then on the locus people weakly prefer A to
B.
But we can go one step further: there must be some point on k∗(z) at which individuals must be
indifferent between A and B, provided we assume everyone moves to B on the right of this
locus, and towards A on the left of this locus. The reason is the nature of our iteration: at
each stage we chose the maximal translation to the right that is possible. If strict preference
for A held at all points on k∗(z), the iteration could not have ended at that stage.5
Call this point of indifference α. Now go back to the locus k
∗
(z) and pick its “twin point” β
(see Figure 4.5). That there is a twin point, at eactly the same vertical height, follows from
the fact that the loci k

(z) and k∗(z) are translates of each other.
Our final claim is that α and β must coincide. To see this, recap the following two points:

Now recall that z has no trend. But then statements [i] and [ii] must be incompatible if we
insist that α and β are distinct! To see this, simply couple together the events at α and β,
and thereafter. For every path starting from α, there is a twin path starting from β, forever
separated by the same distance in z. And the two share exactly the same probability measure!
But the expectation of returns over the first set of paths is zero. Therefore the expectation
of returns over the second set of paths must be positive, because f is increasing in z. This
proves that α and β cannot be distinct.
But then the entire functions k

(z) and k∗(z) must coincide! Call this common function ˆk(z).
We have proved the proposition. It must be that to the left of ˆk(z), everyone moves to A,
while to its right everyone moves to B. Multiple equilibria have been eliminated.

CHAPTER 5
History-Dependence: An Introduction
5.1 An Overview
To summarize what we have studied so far: we’ve looked at multiple equilibrium models
in which there are “good” and “bad” equilibria, often Pareto-ranked. The presence of such
multiplicities has often been put forward as an explanation for underdevelopment. Ot at
least, even if it cannot serve as an explanation, it does succeed in pointing out why entirely
different levels of economic outcomes are consistent with the same underlying fundamentals.
As we have seen, the potential difficulty with the multiple-equilibrium explanation is that
we have no theory of how one equilibrium or the other comes about. Indeed, if we run such
models in real time, there is no particular reason why the economic system cannot “jump”
from one equilibrium to another, such jumps helped along by acts of coordination among
the population. At the same time we know that such jumps make no intuitive sense. An
economy locked into many years of one bad equilibrium is not likely to change overnight
(or at any rate, overnight on any one particular night). We have looked at three different
theoretical frameworks that attempt to come to grips with this. The first takes seriously the
common-knowledge presumptions that underlie these models and shows that a departure
from such presumptions can often pin down unique equilibria, typically mediated by some
public signal. The second approach studies lagged external effects. The third approach
returns to public signals in a dynamic context to precipitate a unique equilibrium.
What’s nice about these models is that they will typically generate rapid transitions from
one equilibrium to another. What these models say that we will observe are long periods
spent in a particular equilibrium, and then a series of events that suddenly hurl the economy
into an entirely different configuration. Many social and economic transformations do have
this “logistic” feature.
In what follows, we take a very different — and complementary — path. Now the state
variable will get center stage and we will push multiple equilibrium into the background.
Indeed, we will consider models in which at every date (and for each going value of the
state variable), there will be a unique outcome. But the dynamics of the system will allow for
multiple steady states. Multiple steady states are therefore not to be confused with multiple
54 History-Dependence: An Introduction
equilibrium. There will typically be just one for every initial condition. But different initial
conditions will often map into different steady states.
There are many different state variables that we can study. Each of them is important enough
to have a book written on them. First begin with economics:
1. The capital stock is, of course, the most common example of a “state” in development
economics. It is the central variable of growth theory. Section 5.3 below tells you a little
bit about the Romer model, in which the initial capital stock can have long-term effects on
economic growth (unlike in the convergence models).
2. Infrastructure represents a special case of item [1], but an extremely important special
case that has yet to be studied carefully in the context of history-dependence.
3. Likewise, it would be of great use to have economic theories of culture and corruption,
which then feed back into economic progress (or the lack thereof). Not that models of
economics and culture don’t exist, but once again there is not that much that fits the historydependence
framework that I emphasize here.
4. Poor societies have legal systems that are limited, if not in terms of laws on the books,
then in terms of actual enforcement of those laws. The same is true of contract enforcement.
Limited enforcement of contracts and laws then feed back on the economic system.
5. Economic inequality: this will be the one topic that we discuss in great detail below. But
stay tuned for future editions in which I plan to take up all the other themes one by one.
Then there is politics:
1. Elites that deny power and therefore cripple subsequent growth.
2. Historical inequalities in (say) the distribution of land that distorts and limits political
participation to demands for redistribution rather than for growth-enhacing investments.
3. the poverty-conflict-poverty cycle, about which we shall have something to say in these
notes.
5.2 Introductory Notes on Economic Inequality
We now turn to a particular — but important — state variable: the disparity in the historical
distribution of assets, or economic inequality. To be sure, inequality is a concept that is of
intrinsic interest, and there is a large literature that has attempted to axiomatize measures
of inequality so that one can keep track of changing income or wealth distributions from a
purely ethical perspective. But there is also the functional aspect of inequality: the interaction
between inequality and other variables of significance in the economy, such as aggregate
output, efficiency, unemployment, and so on. These interactions may take place “within the
period”, so that they are analyzable using a static model, or they be dynamic, in which case
we must use intertemporal models that keep track — among other things — of accumulation
decisions.
History-Dependence: An Introduction 55
Why does inequality matter (not intrinsically, which is a question of ethics, but functionally)?
There are several answers to this question:
[1] Inequality matters because it affects productive potential. The cleanest parable of this has
come to be known as the nutrition-based efficiency wage hypothesis. In poor societies,
wages affect food consumption, and food consumption affects the ability to work. This will
lead to an equilibrium in which the distribution of asset ownership will have economy-wide
effects.
[2] Inequality matters because it affects the ability of individuals to gain access to productive resources.
As long as the distribution of productive ideas or new projects is loosely correlated with the
distribution of wealth, there will be people who have ideas (and abilities), but do not have
access to the wealth needed to put those ideas into real outcomes. This sort of argument
hinges on a missing or imperfect market for capital.
[3] Inequality matters because it affects incentives. There are various aspects of this problem and
we shall address some of them. For instance, what is the connection between an egalitarian
society and incentives? What is the connection between egalitarianism and the extent of
collective action?
[4]Inequality matters for “political-economy” reasons. Under this catch-all are a number of effects
that may be discussed. Inequality may affect voting behavior, leading to different degrees
of redistribution and consequently affecting the incentives to accumulate capital. Inequality
may create social conflict and in this way be related to low output. Finally, inequality (within
an organization) may create efficiency losses, because individuals at different wealth levels
may effectively have different objectives.
[5] Inequality matters because it prevents correct resource allocation on the part of the government.
That is, high inequality may affect the ability of individuals to transmit information
accurately to a policy-maker.
We begin with dynamic models that track the evolution of inequality over generations. The
emphasis will be on items [1] and [2] discussed above.
5.3 A Special Note on Capital Stocks
We now begin our transition to a more serious assessment of initial conditions. Unlike the
more abstract role for history postulated in repeated coordination games, these considerations
arise from full-fledged dynamic models in which state variables play a fundamental
role.
I provide a preliminary illustration of this using a variant of a growth model due to Romer
[1986]. In this model, multiplicity of equilibrium paths can exist from the same initial
condition, but the initial conditions play a fundamental role as well.
56 History-Dependence: An Introduction
Suppose that output is produced at each date t according to the equation
(5.1) yt = F

kt
,
ˆkt

,
where ˆk is the average economy-wide stock of capital, introduced to express the social
externalities from capital (or the knowledge embodied in capital). The idea is that greater
capital in the society at large has positive spillovers for any one producer. In the sequel we
will take kt = ˆkt for all t, but no one individual internalizes this connection in his decisionmaking.
Produced output is divided among consumption and investment as follows:
(5.2) yt = ct + atkt
,
where c represents consumption and ak represents the amount of net investment in the
production of new capital. The fact that we express new investment as a fraction a of the
existing capital stock is simply a matter of convenience.
Investment creates growth in the capital stock. We postulate that
(5.3) kt+1 − kt
kt
= G(at),
so that the rate of growth of the capital stock depends on the “intensity” of investment: on
the investment-capital ratio a.
The objective function takes the familiar form:
(5.4) maxX∞
t=0
β
tu(ct),
where β, the discount factor lies between 0 and 1, and u is a one-period utility function.
The following assumptions will be in force:
(U.1) The utility function u is increasing, continuous and strictly concave on R+.
(G.1) The function G(a) is continuous, increasing and concave, with G(0) = 0 and sup G(a) ≡
B < ∞.
(F.1) The production function F is continuous, nondecreasing, and increasing and concave in
its first argument. However, when private and social capital move together, we assume that
the (private) marginal product of capital is nondecreasing; that is, F1(k, k) is nondecreasing
in k.
Also restrict the discount factor β to ensure that the infinite sum of utilities is always welldefined.
I omit the details here.
Fix some initial stock k and a path of “social capital” stocks ˆz ≡ {ˆkt}, with ˆk0 = k. Notice
that a program (for some individual) can simply be identified with the (private) sequence
z ≡ {kt} (everything else can be recovered from it).Say that such a program z is optimal from k
History-Dependence: An Introduction 57
under zˆ if it maximizes utility (see (5.4)) in the class of all feasible programs. Finally, z is an
equilibrium program if it is optimal from k under z itself.
Using fixed point arguments, it is possible to prove that an equilibrium exists. But of course,
there may be many of them, and this comes from exactly the same considerations that we
have seen earlier in these notes. The fact that an increase in social capital increases private
marginal product means that a complementarity is at work here — higher investments in
the economy as a whole may be self-fulfilling. The point of this section, however, is not to
emphasize the multiplicity but to see how an initial state (proxied in this instance by the
capital stock) — or history — can determine the set of equilibrium paths.
To this end, define an equilibrium program from k to be stationary if kt = k for all t. We may
now state
Proposition 5.1. There exists an equilibrium program from k which is stationary if and only if
(5.5) F1(k, k)G
0
(0) ≤ β
−1 − 1.
Proof. Necessity. Here is an outline which can easily be made fully rigorous. The idea is that
if an equilibrium program is stationary, then a tiny sacrifice of consumption today in return
for a larger stationary stream of output in the future is not worth it. Let’s suppose that the
tiny sacrifice of consumption is . Then the current loss is approximately u0
(c). What is the
future gain? The extra capital stock produced is approximately G0
(0), and consequently the
extra stream of output available from tomorrow is approximately F1(k, k)G
0
(0). If this is all
consumed, then the extra stream of utility from tomorrow is approximately u0
(c)F1(k, k)G
0
(0).
Calculate the present value of this extra stream of gains. Our program is an equilibrium
(and therefore an optimum from k under itself), so this deviation should not be worth it.
This yields (5.5).
Sufficiency. Suppose that expectations of social capital are stationary at ˆkt = k for all t. We
want to show that the stationary program is optimal under these expectations, starting from
k. let c be the consumption under the stationary program and let {kt} be any other program
(feasible from k under stationary expectations) with associated consumption sequence {ct}.

Proposition 5.1 shows us that stationary equilibria exist under certain conditions, and
moreover, that they cannot exist unless those conditions are met. Notice that the condition
(5.5) combines technological parameters, the discount factor, and the initial capital stock in a
specific way. If you combine this restriction with our assumption that F1(k, k) ≥ 0, we see
that at certain low levels of the capital stock, it is possible to stagnate forever.
The role of the initial capital stock is made even sharper in the next proposition, which
tells us that if (5.5) is not met — that is, if the initial capital stock is large enough — then
equilibrium programs must exhibit sustained growth.
Proposition 5.2. If
(5.6) F1(k, k)G
0
(0) > β−1 − 1,
then every equilibrium program must exhibit kt → ∞.
Proof. Notice that {kt} must be a nondecreasing sequence. Suppose, contrary to our claim,
that kt → ¯k < ∞ as t → ∞. Consider the sequence of programs {k
n
t
} given by k
n
t
= k(t + n) for
each n and t. Note that the nth sequence has as its starting stock kn, and that for each n, the
program is an equilibrium from kn. By a standard maximum-theorem-style argument that
History-Dependence: An Introduction 59
we do not include here, the pointwise limit of these programs also represents an equilibrium.
But the limit is the stationary sequence {
¯kt} given by ¯kt = ¯k for all t. By Proposition 5.1 ,
F1(
¯k,
¯k)G
0
(0) ≤ β
−1 − 1.
But ¯k ≥ k, the original initial stock, and given that k fails (9) and F1(k, k) is nondecreasing, we
have a contradiction.
Thus in the Romer model, if the initial capital stock is large enough, equilibrium programs
must grow. No self-fulfilling expectational argument can create stagnation. However, if
the initial capital stock is low, an expectations trap is possible. In this way history and
expectations interact.
In case you have not noticed this already, notice that Propositions 5.1 and 5.2 are different in
one significant respect. Proposition 5.2 rules out stagnation, while Proposition 5.1 says that
stagnation is one possible outcome, but does not rule out growth. So there is a role here for
expectations, despite the influence of history. With more work, one can show that there is an
even lower (positive) value of the capital stock from which no growth can ever occur, and in
the remaining “intermediate” zone there are multiple equilibria involving both stagnation
(as we’ve already seen) and sustained growth, depending on expectations.

CHAPTER 6
The Dynamics of Inequality
6.1 A Introductory Framework
Every dynamic model of growth and distribution will exhibit some form of the following
equations at the level of the individual unit (person, household, region, country). Think
of time as being divided into discrete periods and adopt the view that each period is the
length of an entire generation. So individuals indexed by different dates belong to different
generations. The first equation is just budget balance:
(6.1) yt = ct + xt
,
where y is the lifetime income or wealth of an individual in generation t, c is her consumption
and x is the bequest she leaves to the next generation.
The next equation describes how bequests translate into lifetime income for the next
generation:
(6.2) yt+1 = f(xt),
where f is some production function. Such production functions have different interpretations
depending on the context:
1. It may just be a standard production function as used in the theory of growth, say of the
Cobb-Douglas form.
2. If the individual is part of a competitive economy everyone could earn a wage rate w and
then get a return of 1 + r on bequests, so that
f(x) = w + (1 + r)x.
3. The “production function” may simply represent returns to different “occupations”. For
instance, suppose that it costs nothing to keep your child unskilled but costs x¯ to turn her
into a skilled laborer; then
f(x) =
¯
w for x < x¯
= w¯ for x > x¯.
62 The Dynamics of Inequality
in this case the production function will be exogenous to an individual dynasty but may
well be endogenous from the point of view of the economy as a whole (because the wages
for skilled and unskilled labor will be determined in equilibrium). These represent the sort
of interactive models that will occupy a lot of our attention.
The last ingredient has to do with preferences. There are four notions that appear in the
literature.
WG. Warm Glow. Generation t has a utility function given by U(ct
, xt). See, e.g., Banerjee
and Newman (1993).
CB. Consumption-Based. Generation t has a utility function given by U(ct
, ct+1). See, e.g.,
Arrow (1973), Bernheim and Ray (1986).
IB. Income-Based. Generation t has a utility function given by U(ct
, yt+1). See, e.g., Becker and
Tomes (1979, 1981).
NP. NonPaternalistic. Generation t has a utility function given by U(ct
, Vt+1), where Vt+1 is
the lifetime utility of generation t + 1. See, e.g., Barro (1978) and Loury (1981).
Notice that WG starts to look really problematic in those cases in which the production
function is endogenous, as in the case of occupational choice. It is hard to cling to
some exogenous utility function that is based on bequests when what those bequests are
accomplishing is endogenous to the system. Thus, while WG and IP are equivalent when f
is exogenous, WG is not really something we will be looking at seriously.
What about CB versus IB? I prefer the latter for two reasons.
First, I should be getting a utility out of my child’s “capability”, measured here by lifetime
income or wealth. Just what she does with it — how much she consumes, how much she gives
away — should not really be my concern. That said, we might sometimes see paternalistic
parents who care more about the child’s consumption rather than the resources that she has
access to. I’m not saying this is a logical rebuttal of CB.
Second, a model based on CB is typically hard. There are all sorts of game-theoretic subtleties
involved here (see Kohlberg (1976) and Bernheim and Ray (1986)). It does not seem sensible
to bring in all those subtleties and still try to address the different questions of inequality
and development that we are more interested in here.
That said, however, why not go the whole hog and choose NP over IB? After all, NB is
completely nonpaternalistic: parents only care about the utility of their children: not the
bequests they leave them, or how much they consume, or indeed how much they earn.
There is some sense in this view and we will try and incorporate it in what follows. But it
has to be realized that the value-function approach can be conceptually problematic. It is well
known that NP is equivalent to the maximization of a utility function defined on an infinite
generational stream of consumptions. Do we really internalize that much? Do parents really
calculate future utilities, or do they use the “capability measure” — income/wealth — as a
convenienet shorthand?
The Dynamics of Inequality 63
There is another reason — but more on this later — why NP may not be the correct
specification.
In any case, even at this level of abstraction, we can glean a few general principles. The most
important of these — at least for the aggregative models that we consider — is the principle
of monotonicity. The easiest way to see this is to suppose that a generation has the utility
function
EαU(c, Ψ(k, α)),
where c is its consumption, k is its investment, α is some random shock, and Ψ(k, α) is some
mapping. If it is the identity mapping, then Ψ(k, α) = k and this is like warm-glow. But
Ψ could also represent next-period’s consumption, or income, or utility. For now let us
not worry about the endogeneity of these mappings; we will do that when we get to the
equilibrium analysis.
Assume that
[U] The utility function U is differentiable and strictly concave in c, and exhibits complementarities
between c and Ψ: U12(c, Ψ) ≥ 0.
Renark. Obviously U is not an ordinal property and all of the above can be written as a
suitable supermodularity condition. However, condition [U] is fine enough for what we
want to do.
Proposition 6.1. Assume [U] and suppose that Ψ is nondecreasing in k. Let h be the policy
correspondence that describes the optimal choice of k for each y, subject to the constraint that c = y−k.
Then if y > y
0
, k ∈ h(y), and k0 ∈ h(y
0
), it must be the case that k ≥ k
0
.
Proof. Suppose this assertion is false for some (y, y
0
, k, k
0
) as described in the statement
of the proposition. Then k
0 > k. Notice that k
0
is feasible for y (because it is feasible under y
0
,
which is smaller), while k is feasible under y
0
(because k
0
, which is bigger, is feasible under
y
0
). It follows from optimality that
EU(y − k, Ψ(k, α)) ≥ EU(y − k
0
, Ψ(k
0
, α)),
while
EU(y
0 − k
0
, Ψ(k
0
, α)) ≥ EU(y
0 − k, Ψ(k, α)).
Adding these two inequalities and transposing terms, we see that
EU(y − k, Ψ(k, α)) − EU(y
0 − k, Ψ(k, α)) ≥ EU(y − k
0
, Ψ(k
0
, α)) − EU(y
0 − k
0
, Ψ(k
0
, α)).
Now use the assumption that Ψ is nondecreasing in k, plus the complementarities condition,
to conclude that
EU(y − k
0
, Ψ(k
0
, α)) − EU(y
0 − k
0
, Ψ(k
0
, α)) ≥ EU(y − k
0
, Ψ(k, α)) − EU(y
0 − k
0
, Ψ(k, α)).
Combine these last two inequalities to obtain that
EU(y − k, Ψ(k, α)) − EU(y
0 − k, Ψ(k, α)) ≥ EU(y − k
0
, Ψ(k, α)) − EU(y
0 − k
0
, Ψ(k, α)),
and now draw yourself a diagram to see that the strict concavity of U in c is violated by this
last inequality.
64 The Dynamics of Inequality
This proposition yields the following corollary when there is no uncertainty:
Proposition 6.2. Suppose that there is no uncertainty, that the production function is increasing
in k, and that the optimization problem above is solved repeatedly by successive generations starting
from some initial y. Then the resulting paths of yt and kt must be monotonic in time.
Proof. Suppose not. Then two cases are possible.
Case 1. There exist dates t and s with s ≥ t + 1 such that yt < yt+1, yt+1 = · · · = ys
, and
ys+1 < ys
.
Case 2. There exist dates t and s with s ≥ t + 1 such that yt > yt+1, yt+1 = · · · = ys
, and
ys+1 > ys
.
It is easy to see that one of these two cases must occur if the proposition is false. We now
obtain a contradiction in Case 1; the same argument holds for Case 2.
In Case 1, we have yt+1 > ys+1, it follows from f increasing that kt > ks
. However yt < ys
.
This contradicts Proposition 6.1.
6.2 Inequality and Capital Markets: Noninteraction
There are two approaches to study of evolving inequality. One is to look at ongoing random
shocks. The other is to argue that there are intrinsic market forces which tend to separate
individuals. The first approach typically consists in looking at the ergodic behavior of a
single dynasty, and then equating this to the cross-sectional distribution of the system as a
whole. This is the viewpoint epitomized in several papers: we discuss a variant of Loury
[1981] in these notes.
On the other hand, it should be obvious that the second type of analysis — inequality
arising from market-generated separations across individuals — cannot be conducted by
simply studying the intertemporal behavior of a single agent. Interactions are fundamental.
This is the topic of the next section. Here we study the single-dynasty model.
There is one agent alive at every date, and each agent has a single child, who becomes an
adult in the next “period” (or generation). An agent at date t has access to total resources yt
,
which we may sometimes loosely call income, but is really to be interpreted as the sum of
income and any starting wealth. The agent divides this into consumption (ct) and bequests
for the next generation (kt):
yt = ct + kt
.
Bequests create starting wealth yt+1 for the next generation. More than one interpretation is
possible: these may be financial bequests, or upfront educational investments (the preferred
interpretation by Loury). In any case, yt+1 is not fully pinned down by kt
. A random shock
αt+1 ∈ [0, 1] is also assumed to play a role. One might call this the ability of the agent at date
t + 1. Thus we have
yt+1 = f(kt
, αt+1)
The Dynamics of Inequality 65
where it is obviously reasonable to assume that f is increasing and smooth in the first
argument and that we simply label abilities so that f is also increasing (and continuous) in
the second argument. We assume that abilities are iid on [0, 1], with a continuous density
that is strictly positive on (0, 1).
We will make further assumptions on f, but at present we only need to make one: that even
for the highest ability, the production function ultimately “flattens out”: limk→∞ f
0
(k, 1) < 1
(where f
0
is the derivative with respect to the first argument). This can be justified at a couple
of levels, but the main reason we do this is convenience: we want everything to be bounded
so that we can analyze it simply. [Why does this assumption guarantee that income and
capital must be bounded? Draw a diagram of the “best-case” production function under
this assumption and satisfy yourself.]
Note that — unlike Loury — we do not assume that f is concave. This allows us to put other
models in perspective (more on this below).
Now turn to preferences. We shall assume that each generation is a dynastic utility
maximizer; that is, it seeks to maximize
u(c) + δEV,
where u is some smooth strictly concave utility function defined on current consumption,
δ ∈ (0, 1) is a discount factor, and V is the expected lifetime utility to be experienced by the
child. The expectation is taken before the V because it is assumed that the parent does not
know how the child’s ability will turn around at the time of making the educational bequest.
That is, given some y, a parent tries to maximize, choosing k,
(6.3) u(y − k) + δEαV

f(k, α)

subject to the constraint that 0 ≤ k ≤ y. Notice that the function V is fundamentally
endogenous and that it must solve the well-known functional equation:
V(y) = max
0≤k≤y

u(y − k) + δEαV

f(k, α)
.
That such a consistent V exists can be proved using standard arguments. which we omit
here. It can also be shown that V is continuous in y.
1
The beauty of this sort of argument is that it essentially reduces an infinite-dimensional
problem to something very simple: the one-variable maximization problem expressed in
equation (6.3). From this problem we get what is called an (optimal) policy correspondence
Γ(y). This is the set of all k’s which solve (6.3), given the starting value y. Notice that we
have made no assumptions on the curvature of f so in principle this correspondence could
have arbitrary shape. It turns out that the following monotonicity argument must be true:
Proposition 6.3. Suppose that y ≤ y
0
and that k ∈ Γ(y) and k0 ∈ Γ(y
0
). Then it must be that k0 ≥ k.
Proof. Verify that all the conditions of Proposition 6.1 are satisfied.
1The argument used to establish the existence, uniqueness and continuity of V is the famous Banach contraction
mapping theorem. See Stokey and Lucas [1989] for how this works with value functions such as those in this
model.
66 The Dynamics of Inequality
Recall from Proposition 6.2 that this would immediately yield a convergence argument if
there is no uncertainty. Of course, the current model does have uncertainty so this simple
sequence argument cannot be applied. [Try it and see where it fails.] But nevertheless, the
proposition continues to be helpful in this and in other cases, as we shall see in a bit.
Let’s return to the convergence argument in the face of uncertainty. Is there some way
in which we can approach this problem? Here I follow Loury in making the following
additional assumptions on the production function:
Poor Geniuses Exist. f(0, 1) > 0.
Rich Fools Exist. f(k, 0) < k for all k > 0.
I’ve labeled the assumptions so that they are self-explanatory. Just in case: the first
assumption states that even if you don’t invest anything into a high-ability child, she will
end up making some money. The second assumption states that low-ability children drain
resources: whatever you put in, less comes out.
Under these two assumptions, the following important proposition is true:
Proposition 6.4. Let µ0 be an initial probability measure on the set of initial incomes of generation
zero, and denote by µt the distribution of income for generation t induced by the equilibrium behavior
described above. Then there exists a unique measure µ
∗
such that µt converges to µ
∗
as t → ∞, and
this measure µ
∗
is independent of µ0.
It is important to understand why this result is true, as it leads to a significant insight into
how uncertainty works in these models. To this end, consult Figure 6.1. He we show
diagrammatically how income evolves from generation to generation within a dynasty,
starting with income y0 at date 0. An investment of k0 is made, and this leads to an uncertain
income at the next generation (the little hill on the t = 1 line marks the density of such
incomes). A typical income realization is the level y1, at which the investment k1 is made,
and the whole process repeats itself. The density conditional on an investment k1 is shown
by the little hill on the t = 1 line, while the thick density with larger support shows all
possible values of y2 two periods hence (that is, conditioning on y0 but not on the specific
realization of y1).
Now, in this diagram I have marked out a special interval of incomes I which has the
property that no matter where you start from, there will be a (common) date T such that
these densities (conditional on the starting point) “envelop” the interval I (with probability
uniformly positive. This fact follows from the two assumptions we’ve made above regarding
“poor fools” and “rich geniuses” (though, as we shall see in a bit, the assumptions are not
necessary). The point is that with positive probability and at some uniformly chosen date,
the system will wander into I no matter what the initial conditions were.
A formal proof of this assertion is provided in Section 6.2.2. But intuitively, what this means
is that the system must lose its memory, its history, at some point of time (for whatever
happens with positive probability must happen for sure). That suggests that limit behavior
is independent of history, which indeed is the broad substance of Proposition 6.4.

Figure 6.1. A Dynastic Income Path
If you want to know more about the technicalities of this ergodic theorem, look at the
general result (Proposition 6.5) given in Section 6.2.2. Essentialy, the ability of the process to
“communicate” or “mix” no matter what the initial conditions were, is responsible for the
history-independent limit behavior of the system.
Another way to graphically examine the mixing property is to look at the policy functions
generated as a result of dynastic optimization. While these map from current y to the current
choice of k, we shall do this slightly different: the result is shown in Figure 6.2. The diagram
places current income on the horizontal axis, and tomorrow’s income on the vertical axis.
Of course, tomorrow’s income is uncertain, and may therefore be represented by a band
of possible incomes, which boils down to an interval of incomes for each value of today’s
income.
Now, in part (a) of this figure, notice that there are two clear zones. In Zone I, income must
be bounded above by the value YI
, which is the biggest intersection (in this region) of the
stochastic correspondence with the 450
line. By monotonicity of the policy correspondence,
it follows that if y ≤ YI
, y can never cross the value YI
, even under the most optimistic
conjectures regarding the realization of ability shocks. Likewise, there is a lower bound YII

in a different region of the policy correspondence. By the same logic, if y ≥ YII, y can never
fall below the value YII, even under the most pessimistic realization of ability shocks. Notice
that in this diagram, YII exceeds YI
, so that there two regions are effectively segregated.
Proposition 6.4 can thus never hold for this scenario.
Now study panel (b) of Figure 6.2. Here, there is an upper trap YII just as we had before,
but there is no “lower trap”: incomes starting below can always wander into the zone to the
right of YII, and must stay there therafter. Thus there is full mixing and the ergodicity result
of Proposition 6.4 is restored.
But are the two assumptions concerning fools and geniuses met? Not really? We have,
reflected in panel (b), a variant of these assumptions, which does just as well. In fact,
convince yourself by drawing an imaginary panel (c), that if YI
is well-defined but there is
no YII, that this would be pretty much in line with the assumptions we do have. But now you
also see that the specific form of our assumptions is not really necessary: what we are after
is really the existence of a mixing zone, as described in Figure 6.2’s panel (b), for instance.
6.2.1 Uncertainty, Inequality, and Ergodicity. What, then, is the precise role played by
uncertainty in these models? To understand this, it will be useful to first strip the uncertainty
away altogether, and simply look at a deterministic version.
First of all, suppose that the model is fully convex: that is, in addition to u being strictly
concave, we shall also assume that f is strictly concave (in addition to assuming the endpoint
conditions f
0
(0) = ∞ and f
0
(∞) < 1). Now the optimal policy correspondence is really a
function, and by proposition 6.3 it must be a nondecreasing function. It is therefore easy
enough to see — by iteration — that the sequence of dynastic incomes {y0, y1, y2 . . .} must
converge to some steady state y
∗
. It is also easy to see (under our assumptions) that y
∗ must
be strictly positive.
The Dynamics of Inequality 69
At this stage we don’t know what y
∗
is. We do not even know whether y
∗
is unique or not. Of
course, it is unique given y0, but nothing in what we’ve said so far rules out the possibility
that it might change as y0 changes. But in fact, this cannot happen, and the easiest way to see
this is to use the Euler equation to the solution of the optimization problem, which shows
us that
(6.4) u
0
(ct) = δu
0
(ct+1)f
0
(kt)
for all t ≥ 0. In the limit, yt → y
∗
, so it is trivial to see that kt and ct must converge as well, say
to k
∗ and c
∗
respectively. Passing to this limit in the Euler equation (6.4), we may conclude
that
(6.5) δ f
0
(k
∗
) = 1,
which, by the way, is the famous formula for the “modified golden rule” in optimal growth
problems. When f is strictly concave, the value of k
∗
is uniquely pinned down. There can
be, therefore, no more than one value for limit income, no matter where one starts from.
Convergence occurs to perfect equality (though this may take time).
This brings us to the first role of uncertainty: by creating ongoing shocks (in this case to
ability), it keeps individuals away from perfect equality. With each shock, one might think
of the convergence problem as beginning again, but it is regularly perturbed by ongoing,
further shocks. Thus uncertainty acts as a tool to create inequality in a world of convergence.
Several economists who rely on convergence-based models generally invoke uncertainty to
“explain” inequality. [In fact, Loury’s model assumes that f is strictly concave and is
therefore an example of this.]
Now suppose that we drop the concavity of f. Now (6.4) is still valid as an interior first-order
condition, though we must be careful about checking second-order conditions. The main
point, however, is that (6.5) will now admit several solutions in general. And indeed, there
are now several steady states, depending on initial conditions. With decreasing returns
dispensed with, history is perfectly capable of creating a lock-in effect. If there is inequality
to start with, it may not go away: individuals may remain stuck in different steady states.
This multiplicity in the face of nonconvexities has been known for some time (see, e.g.,
Majumdar and Mitra [1982] and more recently, the first part of Galor and Zeira [1993]).
But the possibility of such historical lock-in (arising from the convex f) brings us to a second
role for uncertainty, which is its ability to remove such lock-ins. After all, the analysis in the
previous section did not rely at all on the concavity of f. It is quite possible that the “mixing”
condition discussed there holds even when f has the “wrong” curvature. This means that
uncertainty can actually remove lock-ins and restore equality (or at least equality of long-run
opportunity) when in the presence of perfect certainty, such equality would be missing.
This sort of discussion suggests that a study of uncertainty in this context may be misleading
at the same time that it may be illuminating. It may be misleading because even very small
mixing probabiluities lead us back to ergodicity (for instance, assume that everyone has a
small but positive probability of winning the state lottery; then the mixing condition would
be satisfied). But it may be a long time coming. For this reason, an uncertainty-based theory
may hide certain structural features of the model. (For instance, we we’ve seen, there is a
70 The Dynamics of Inequality
deep difference between the case of concave and convex f, but somehow the presence of
uncertainty permitted us to provide a mathematically similar treatment.)
There is a final point about the role of uncertainty that might be worth making. It is peculiar
to the noninteractive models that we have been discussing. Notice that with or without
a mixing condition, it is possible to derive limit theorems regarding the distribution of
income, in the following sense: starting from an initial y0, the resulting distributions of
income converge. The mixing condition simply adds that there will be a common limit to
which the convergence occurs. Without the mixing condition — as in panel (a) of Figure 6.2
— there will be several steady states, but two different limit distributions must have no incomes
in common. [If they did, the mixing condition would be satisfied, and we would not have
two different limits in the first place.]
This is a peculiar and interesting characteristic of the noninteractive model, and also points to
its inadequacy. If one wants to use such models to explain varying different distributions in,
say, different countries with the same underlying fundamentals, one would have to contend
with the uncomfortable prediction that the poorest person in one country must be richer
than the richest person in the other country! The more realistic (but more complicated)
interactive models that study later will set us free of this difficulty.
6.2.2 Technical Aside on Markov Processes and Existence of Mixing Interval . This
section included for completeness only. Not for a development course.
Let P be a transition probability on some state space X. It will be useful to have notation
for the m-step transition probability generated by P. This is, intuitively, the probability of
the system being in the subset A after m periods, starting from some given state x “today”.
Clearly, this is given by the measure µm, starting from the case where µ0 assigns probability
one to x. This measure we will denote in transition probability form as P
m(x, A), for any
measurable subset A of X.
The fundamental condition to be investigated is
Condition M (Stokey and Lucas [1989]) There exist  > 0 and an integer M ≥ 1 such that for
any event A, either (i) P
M(x, A) ≥  for all x ∈ X, or (ii) P
M(x, A
C) ≥  for all x ∈ X.
To appreciate condition M, let’s look at a case when it is not satisfied. Consider the familiar
two-state Markov chain in which πij = 1 if and only if i , j, for i, j = 1, 2. Pick A = {1}. Then
for any positive integer M, P
M(x, A) = 1 either if M is even and x = 1, or if M is odd and
x = 2. Otherwise, P
M(x, A) = 0. This means that condition M fails. We see therefore, that
the real bite of condition M is in the postulated uniformity with which all states hit particular
events.
Before we state the main result of this section, let us also relate Condition M to convergence
in the Loury model. Let Y be the solution to f(Y, 1) = Y: it is the maximum possible output
level. We first prove a formalization of the claim made in the main text regarding the “mixing
interval” I:
The Dynamics of Inequality 71
Claim. There exists a date M, an interval I of incomes, and 
0 > 0 such that for every
measurable subset Iλ of I of measure λ,
Prob {yM ∈ Iλ|y0} ≥ λ0
independently of y0 ∈ [0,Y].
Proof. By the assumptions on f and α, and using the “rich genius” condition, there exists a
compact interval I = [A, B], with 0 < A < B, and a number a with 0 < a < A, such that the
random variable f(k, α) has strictly positive density on I for every k ∈ [0, a]. Let 
0 be the
minimum value of this density. It is easy to see that under our assumptions, 
0 > 0.
It follows that for every measurable subset Iλ of I of measure λ,
(6.6) Prob {f(k, α) ∈ Iλ|k} ≥ λ0
independently of k ∈ [0, a].
For any y0 and t ≥ 1, let Yt denote the random variable describing output at date t if all output
is systematically invested up to date t, and none consumed. By the rich fools assumption,
there is some date M ≥ 1 and some probability η > 0 such that
Prob {YM−1 ∈ [0, a]|y0} ≥ η
independently of y0 ∈ [0,Y].
Now turn to the equilibrium policy. Look at the equilibrium value of kM conditional on any
y0 ∈ [0,Y]. Because kM ≤ yM ≤ YM−1, we see that
(6.7) Prob {kM ∈ [0, a]|y0} ≥ η
independently of y0 ∈ [0,Y].
Combining (6.6) and (6.7), we must conclude that for every measurable subset Iλ of I of
measure λ,
Prob {yM ∈ Iλ|y0} ≥ λ0
independently of y0 ∈ [0,Y], and the claim is proved.
With the Claim in hand, it is easy to verify Condition M for the Loury model. Pick I, M and

0 as in the Claim, let ι be the measure of I, and define  ≡ ι0
/2. Now for any event A, either
A ∩ I has measure at least ι/2 (in which case define Iι/2 ≡ A ∩ I) or I − A has measure at least
ι/2 (in which case define Iι/2 ≡ I − A). Now apply the Claim to the set Iι/2 to verify Condition
M.
The main result of this section concerns the implication of Condition M:
Proposition 6.5. Under condition M, there exists a unique invariant probability measure µ
∗
such
that for any initial µ0 on X, the generated sequence {µt} converges strongly to µ
∗
.
Proof. We will follow the finite horizon case exactly. That is, we will show that
(1) M — the set of all probability measures on X — equipped with the total variation
metric is a complete metric space.
72 The Dynamics of Inequality
(2) The operator T
M : M → M given by
T
M(µ)(A) ≡
Z
X
P
M(x, A)µ(dx),
for all A, is a contraction.
(3) Thus T
M has a unique fixed point µ
∗ and the M-step iterates of any initial probability
measure must converge to µ
∗
.
(4) The convergence of the entire sequence of measures, and not just this particular
subsequence, can then be established by a subsequence argument identical to that
used in the finite horizon case.
All the new stuff is in the first two items. To these we now proceed.
First we establish the completeness ofM. To this end, suppose that {µ
n
} is a Cauchy sequence
in M. then from the definition of the total variation metric, it follows that for each event A,
µ
n
(A) is a Cauchy sequence of numbers. By the completeness of the real line, µ
n
(A) converges
to some µ(A) for each A. We will show that µ is a probability measure and that µ
n
converges
strongly to µ.
It is obvious that µ(A) ∈ [0, 1] for all A, that µ(X) = 1, and that µ(∅) = 0. It remains to prove
countable additivity to establish that µ is indeed a probability measure. To this end, let {Ai}
be a countable collection of disjoint events in X. Then
µ(∪

i=1Ai) = limn→∞

where the second-last equality follows from the dominated convergence theorem. This
proves that µ is indeed a bonafide probability measure. What’s left to do is to show that
||µ
n
, µ|| → 0 as n → ∞. Note that because {µ
n
} is Cauchy, for all  > 0, there is N such that if
n, m ≥ N,
|µ
n
(A) − µ
m(A)| ≤ 
for all sets A. Taking limits in m, it follows that
|µ
n
(A) − µ(A)| ≤ 
for all n ≥ N, and for all A, which implies that ||µ
n
, µ|| → 0 as n → ∞.
This establishes the completeness of M.
Our next task is to show that T
M is a contraction of modulus 1 − . To this end, pick µ
and µ
0
in M. Then there is a “common” part γ and “idiosyncratic” parts µ
1 and µ
2
, so that
µ = µ
1 + γ, µ
0 = µ
2 + γ, and µ
1 and µ
2 have disjoint support.
Digression. The technical details of this assertion rely on the Radon-Nikodym Theorem (see
Stokey and Lucas [1989, Lemma 7.12]). But one can informally illustrate how the common
part is obtained in the case where µ and µ
0 have densities f and f
0 on the real line. In this
case, simply define g(x) ≡ min{f(x), f
0
(x)} for each x ∈ R, and integrate this as you would to
get a cdf, to arrive at the common part of the measure γ. This measure γ is, of course, not
a probability measure. The idiosyncratic residuals µ
1 and µ
2 are then defined by inserting
the rest of the probability, event by event, to bring total probability up to µ and µ
0
. In this
The Dynamics of Inequality 73
way you see that the measures µ
1 and µ
2 are not probability measures either. Now study
the values µ
1
(X) and µ
2
(X), which are the values assumed by the measures on the entire
state space. Note, first, that these must be equal to each other. Note, also, that their common
value must be equal to the supremum difference between the probability measures µ and µ
0
over any event. To see this, note that for any event A
|µ(A) − µ
0
(A)| = |µ
1
(A) − µ
2
(A)|
≤ max{µ
1
(A), µ2
(A)}
≤ max{µ

(X)}.
This ends our digression.

6.3 Interactive Inequality
It is now time to unpack the nature of the household production function. In many important
situations, it is determined by relative prices. This nring us to models of interactive
inequality, in which no household or dynasty can be treated as an isolated unit.
6.3.1 Relative Prices and Efficiency Units. Economists have traditionally employed a
simple shorthand for the study of occupational diversity, which is to reduce different
qualifications and skills to aggregate quantities of “human capital”. In other words, all
human capital is — even before we write down the definition of equilibrium for the society in question
— commonly expressible in some common efficiency unit.2 This approach is summarized
by Becker and Tomes in their 1986 paper:
2
So, for instance the investment choice in Loury’s model is interpreted as a choice of “how much” education to
acquire: there is no formal difference between human and physical capital. The so-called endogenous growth
models (see, e.g., Lucas (1988)) continue, by and large, to retain this shorthand.
74 The Dynamics of Inequality
Investment Levels
Returns
“Human Capital”
“Financial Capital”
Figure 6.3. Efficiency Units
“Although human capital takes many forms, including skills and abilities,
personality, appearance, reputation and appropriate credentials, we further
simplify by assuming that it is homogeneous and the same “stuff” in
different families.” (Becker-Tomes (1986, p.56), emphasis ours)
The crucial assumption is that the relative returns to different occupations are exogenous,
so that the reduction to efficiency units can be carried out separately from the behavioral
decisions made in the population. It is, in fact, common to specify that the returns to human
capital are concave while the return to financial investment is linear (see Figure 6.3).
It is unclear what different “levels” of human capital mean independent of the relative market
returns, which are typically endogenous. We might all agree that skilled labor embodies
more human capital than unskilled labor. But the assumption that skilled and unskilled
can be reduced to a common and determinate yardstick of efficiency units presumes much
more than this ordinal comparison. The implications of such an assumption can be quite
significant, as we show in the next section.
6.3.2 Endogenous Relative Prices: Persistent Inequality With Two Skills. The following
analysis is based on Ray (1990). Elements of this model appear in Ljungqvist (1993),
Freeman (1996) and Mookherjee and Ray (2003). The specific exposition follows Ray (2006).
Suppose that aggregate production is a CRS function of just two inputs: skilled and unskilled
tasks, satisfying Inada conditions in each. There are two occupations: skilled and unskilled
The Dynamics of Inequality 75
labor. The latter can only do the unskilled tasks. Wages in each occupation equal their
respective marginal products, and so depend on relative supplies of workers in the two
occupations. Skill acquisition requires a fixed parental investment in education. Assume
that this is the only way a parent can transfer wealth to their children, i.e., there are no
financial bequests. In a later section we drop this assumption.
Now observe that even if all parents in the economy have identical wealth and preferences,
they cannot all leave the same bequests. The reason is simple. If every parent keeps their child
unskilled, there will be no skilled people in the next generation, raising the return to skilled
labor enough that investment in skill will be the optimal response. Conversely, if all children
are skilled, the return to skill will vanish, killing off the investment motive.3 Hence even
if all families start equal in generation 0, some will invest and others will not; in the next
generation their fortunes must separate.
Just who goes in one direction and who in another is entirely accidental, but such accidents
will cast long shadows on dynastic welfare. Indeed, the two directions are utility-equivalent
for generation 0, but not for generation 1! Furthermore, in succeeding generations wealthier
parents will have a greater incentive to train their children, so that the “primitive inequality”
that sets in at the first generation will be reinforced: children of skilled parents will be
more likely to acquire skills themselves. The logic of “symmetry-breaking” implies that
every steady state in this example must involve persistent inequality. The endogeneity of
occupational returns is central to this argument.4
In contrast to this example, observe that the same argument does not apply to activities in
which each unit is a perfect substitute for another. For instance, if shares in physical capital
can be divisibly held, everyone can derive the very same rate of return on each unit. But a
single individual cannot hold an arbitrarily fine portfolio of different occupations.5
In the subsections that follow, I develop this argument in more detail.
6.3.2.1 Preliminaries Time is discrete, running t = 0, 1, 2 . . .. A dynasty is represented by
an infinite sequence of individuals, each individual living for a single period. There is a
continuum of dynasties so that a unit mass of atomless individuals belongs to a generation
at each date.
There are two skill categories, “high” and “low”, which are combined via a production
function f to produce a single final output, which we take to be the numeraire. An individual
in the high-skill category (or a “high individual” for short) earns a wage w¯t at date t.
3
If skilled labor cannot perform unskilled tasks, the unskilled wage will become very high by the Inada
conditions. But even if they can perform unskilled tasks, this will equalize the two wage rates. Either
interpretation has the same outcome.
4
See e.g., Katz and Murphy (1992) for the responsiveness of US skill premia to relative supply of skilled workers.
5This discussion suggests, then, that the correct dividing line is not between “physical” and “human” bequests,
but rather bequests that result in endowments that are alienable (e.g. money) and endowments that are not
(e.g. occupations). The latter may include transfers of physical assets such as a family business which is not
incorporated — perhaps for reasons of moral hazard or simply the lack of development of a stock market. These
transfers are no different from human bequests in their implications for disequalization, and should be included
in the category of “occupational bequests”.
76 The Dynamics of Inequality
Likewise, a low individual earns
¯
wt
. Whether or not an individual is high or low depends
on the investment made by her parent. Being low at any date requires no investment by the
parent; being high requires an exogenous investment of x.
Earned income is partly consumed and partly used in educating the individual’s offspring.
Depending on the education level of the child, the child receives an income next period, and
the entire process repeats itself without end.
Now I turn to the determination of wages. Assume that the production function f for final
output is smooth, CRS in its two inputs, strictly concave in each input and satisfies the Inada
end-point conditions. Given a unit mass of individuals, if a fraction λ of them is high at
some date, then the high wage is given by
w¯(λ) ≡ f1(λ, 1 − λ),
while the low wage is given by
¯
w(λ) ≡ f2(λ, 1 − λ).
where these subscripts represent partial derivatives. We will call these wages the wages
associated with λ.
It is easy to see that w¯(λ) is decreasing and continuous in λ, with w¯(λ) → ∞ as λ →
0. Likewise,
¯
w(λ) is increasing and continuous in λ, with
¯
w(λ) → ∞ as λ → 1. These
observations imply, in particular, that there exists a threshold λ˜ such that w¯(λ˜) =
¯
w(λ˜).
To complete the description of the model, we presume that each generation t maximizes an
additive function of the one-period utility ut from its own consumption, and the lifetime
utility (Vt+1) felt by generation t + 1, discounted by δ ∈ (0, 1). The utility function u will
be assumed to be increasing, smooth and strictly concave in consumption, and defined at
least on [−x, ∞). This last requirement is innocuous but serves to simplify notation and
exposition. Moreover, the idea that consumption can go negative captures the idea that the
borrowing constraint is never absolute, but that the investment of x at lower wealth levels
entails ever greater utility losses (by strict concavity of u).
6.3.2.2 Equilibrium Suppose, now, that an infinite sequence of wages is given, one for
each skill category. We may denote this by the path {w¯t
,
¯
wt
}
∞
t=0
. With such a sequence given,
consider the maximization problem of generation t. Denote by V¯
t the lifetime utility for
a high member of that generation, and by
¯
Vt
the corresponding lifetime utility for a low
member. Standard arguments tell us that the sequence {V¯
t
,
¯
Vt
}
∞
t=0
is connected over time in
the following way: for each date t,
(6.8) V¯

subject to the conditions that
(6.9) ct + xt = w¯t
,
and
Vt+1 = V¯

In exactly the same way,
¯
Vt = max u(ct) + δVt+1, subject to the analogous budget constraint
ct + xt =
¯
wt
and (6.10).
These maximization problems describe how education levels change from generation to
generation, given some sequence of wage rates. To complete the equilibrium setting, we
remind ourselves that the wages are endogenous; in particular, they will depend on the
proportion of high individuals at each date.
Formally, for given λ0 ∈ (0, 1), a competitive equilibrium is a sequence {w¯t

such that
[i] Given λ0, the path {λt} is generated by the maximization problems described above.
[ii] For each t, w¯t and

wt
are the wages associated with λt
.
Standard fixed-point arguments suffice to show that a competitive equilibrium exists, and
we will not pursue such matters here.
Notice that our definition of competitive equilibrium assigns wages on the presumption that
skilled labor must carry out skilled tasks. Alternatively, we could restate the definition so
that if the “natural wages” (as given by marginal product) for a skilled worker falls short of
that of an unskilled worker, the former will move into the sector of the latter so that the two
wages will be ex post equalized. None of this matters much anyway because of the following
easy observation, which holds no matter what definition we use:
Observation 6.1. Recalling that λ˜ solves w¯(λ˜) =
¯
w(λ˜), 0 < λt < λ˜ for all t ≥ 1 along any
competitive equilibrium.
The formalities of the (obvious) proof are omitted.6
From now on I will also presume that
λ0 ∈ (0, λ˜) as well. There is no great mystery in this: it saves the expositional trouble of
having to qualify several arguments for the initial value of λ.
For later use, I also record a familiar single-crossing observation.
Observation 6.2. Under a competitive equilibrium, there is no date at which a low person creates a
high child while simultaneously, a high person creates a low child.
The proof of this observation runs exactly parallel to (and in fact can be derived as a special
case of) Proposition 6.1, and is therefore omitted.

The single-crossing property in the previous section yields a simple characterization of
steady states. Let w¯ ≡ w¯(λ) and

V be the

infinitely high otherwise, so that some educational investment would have taken place prior to that period.
[Here we use the assumption that u is defined on [−x, ∞).] On the other hand, λt cannot exceed λ˜ for any t ≥ 1,
for in that case high and low wages are equalized, and no one in the previous generation would then have
invested in high skills.

lifetime utilities associated with being (initially) high and low, respectively. By Observation
6.2, the following two conditions are necessary and sufficient for λ to be a steady state:
V¯ = u(w¯ − x) + δV¯ ≥ u(w¯) + δ

V,
while

is a necessary and sufficient condition for λ to be a steady state. Combining this expression

Figure 6.4. The Set of Steady States
Figure 6.5 plots the three terms in (6.11) as a function of λ. The left hand side, denoted by
κ¯, is just the utility cost to a high parent of acquiring skills for her child. This lies uniformly
below the right hand side, denoted by
¯
κ, which tracks the same utility cost to a low parent.
Finally, the middle term, denoted by B, is the present value of benefits to being high rather
than low. Of course, the κ¯ and
¯
κ lines meet at λ˜, because wages are equalized there.
The Dynamics of Inequality 79
Note, moreover, that as λ → λ˜, B turns negative while κ¯ is positive. On the other hand,
as λ → 0, B grows unboundedly large while κ¯ is bounded above. Because the changes are
monotone, there is a unique λ
∗ ∈ (0, λ˜) such that the first inequality in (6.11) holds with
equality. Observe, moreover, that at λ = λ
∗
, the second inequality in (6.11) must hold as well,
because of the strict concavity of the utility function. Thus the set of steady states contains
some interval to the left of λ
∗
, and must be a subset of (0, λ∗
].
Beyond this last observation, the set of steady states may be complicated. In particular, the
set need not be connected. For instance, in Figure 6.5, the set of steady states is the union of
the two intervals [λ3, λ2] and [λ1, λ∗
].
Notice that every steady state involves persistent inequality, not just in gross incomes but in
net utility. In the subsection that follows, I show that the dynamics of an intertemporal
competitive equilibrium leads society to one of these steady states.
6.3.2.4 Dynamics Recall from the previous section that λ
∗
is a steady state, and it is the
largest possible steady state. We now state and prove the following
Proposition 6.7. If λ0 > λ∗
, then there exists a unique competitive equilibrium from λ0. It goes to
a steady state in one period: λ0 > λ1 = λt
for all t ≥ 1.
If λ0 < λ∗
, then along a competitive equilibrium λt converges monotonically to the smallest steady
state no less than λ. Convergence is never attained in finite time unless λ happens to be a steady
state to start with, in which case λt = λ0 for all subsequent t.
The proposition provides a full account of the behavior of skill proportions over time,
starting from any initial condition. If that initial condition happens to be a steady state,
the proposition rules out any equilibrium path other than the steady state path itself. More
interesting is the asymmetry of equilibrium behavior under the two remaining kinds of
initial conditions. When λ0 is larger than the largest conceivable steady state, convergence
to a steady state occurs in a single unit of time. When λ0 is such that there are steady states
“above” it, convergence is gradual in that the process is never completed in finite time. This
asymmetry may have interesting implications for unanticipated technical changes which,
once realized, are expected to stay in place thereafter. Changes that call for a reduction
in steady state skill proportions take place quickly and dramatically, whereas a climb to a
higher steady state is more gradual and drawn out.
Moreover, in the case that convergence is “up” to a steady state, the proposition asserts that
it will occur to the nearest steady state to the right of the initial conditions. Put another way,
only the left-most steady state in each interval of steady states can be an attractor for initial
conditions that are distinct from that steady state, and the basin of attraction is precisely the
set of initial conditions that lie between it and the next, lower interval of steady states (if
any). Thus, despite the multiplicity of steady states, final outcomes can be tagged to initial
conditions in a unique way, allowing us in principle to perform comparative dynamics.
To provide some intuition for these results, first study a non-steady-state value of λ that is
smaller than λ
∗
. Why is this not a steady state? Surely, the “no-deviation” condition for the
skilled (the first inequality in (6.11)) is satisfied; after all, it was satisfied at λ
∗
, and now at
80 The Dynamics of Inequality
the smaller value of λ, both the wage differential is higher and the utility cost of education is
lower for the skilled. So, the reason why λ fails to be a steady state is that the “no-deviation”
condition for the unskilled — the second inequality in (6.11) — is violated; their utility cost
of education is high, but not as high as the wage differential. To maintain equilibrium
incentives, then, the economy-wide skill ratio must rise, compressing the sequence of wage
differentials until the unskilled are exactly indifferent between acquiring and not acquiring
skills. [We have already seen in Lemma 6.1 that this compression to indifference is a necessary
feature of non-steady-state equilibrium, otherwise no one would stay unskilled.]
Now here is the main point: the skill ratio achieved in the very next period cannot be a steady
state. For if it were, then the no-deviation condition of the unskilled must be satisfied here,
so that the new implied wage differential generates no incentive for them to acquire skills.
But the very same wage differential created indifference at date 0, when the utility cost of
acquiring education was higher for the unskilled! This is a contradiction. By an obvious
recursive argument, it follows that the upward movement in the skill ratio must be gradual
and perennial.
Exactly the opposite is true for non-steady-state values of λ that exceed λ
∗
. For such values,
the “no-deviation” condition for the skilled surely fails; the wage differential is too small
relative to the utility cost of maintaining skills. So in equilibrium, λ falls. This fall along the
equilibrium path raises wage differentials so that the skilled are now indifferent between
maintaining and relinquishing skills.
We claim that the new skill ratio one period later must be a steady state. Suppose the claim is
false. Then the new skill ratio is not a steady state, and this can happen for one of two
reasons. First, the no-deviation condition for the unskilled fails — the wage differential at
date 1 is too attractive. In that case, we already know that the remaining sequence of wage
differentials (counting from date two on) must render the unskilled indifferent at date 1. But
this means that the sequence of wage differentials counting from date one on is still attractive
for the unskilled, and would have been a fortiori attractive relative to the skill-acquisition
cost for the unskilled at the higher skill ratio prevailing at date 0. But this, in turn, exceeds
the cost of skill maintenance for the skilled, which contradicts the fact that the equilibrium
creates indifference for the skilled at date 0 (see last sentence of preceding paragraph).
The second reason why the new skill ratio may fail to be a steady state is that the no-deviation
condition for the skilled fails again (just as it did at date 0). This means that the skill ratio
must fall even further in succeeding periods to create indifference for the skilled at date 1.
However, because the wage differential at date 1 is not attractive enough, this means that
the entire sequence of wage differentials, counting the one at date 1, would not have been
attractive enough for the very same skilled individuals, had they been located at date 0, but
with the utility costs they possess at date 1. This would be a fortiori true if we were to replace
the utility costs with the true utility costs of maintaining skills at date 0, which are higher.
But now we have a contradiction again (see the last sentence two paragraphs above). This
completes our intuitive description.
Proposition 6.7 asserts convergence from every initial condition to some steady state.
Moreover, the particular steady state to which convergence occurs can be identified, and
this is of interest because there are multiple steady states.
The Dynamics of Inequality 81
How general are these results on convergence; in particular, do they extend to the case of
several occupations? The simple answer is that I do not know. At the same time, as we are
going to see in the next section, with endogenous relative prices the steady state findings are
very general. With endogenous price determination and imperfect credit markets, steadystate
inequality among ex-ante identical agents is inevitable under broad conditions. It
would, therefore, be of great interest to see if the dynamic counterparts of the results in this
section also carry over.
6.4 More on Relative Prices and Persistent Inequality
Recall the two-skill example with which we started the previous section. We argued that
even with parents of identical wealth, symmetry-breaking must occur “in equilibrium”:
after all, it cannot be that all parents skill their children, or that all parents leave their
children unskilled. This symmetry-breaking led to persistent inequality. It is natural to
ask whether the same results hold when parents can compensate low-skilled children with
greater financial bequests. Symmetry-breaking would still occur, but only in “occupational
space”: there would be no inequality in overall wealth, human plus financial. In this section,
based on Mookherjee and Ray (2007), I carefully investigate the validity of this argument.
A second assumption that we made is that there are only two occupations. On the face of
it, this is is just a simplification, and indeed, most of the literature works off two or three
occupations simply for expositional ease. But as we shall see, bringing in many occupations
(all with varying relative prices) makes two major conceptual differences. The first is that
“many” different levels of human capital can be chosen, along with financial bequests
(see previous paragraph). From the household point of view — with all relative prices
taken as given — we have then a standard “production function” of the form displayed
in Figure 6.3, which is the outer envelope of all human and financial investments. But
there is one difference: the shape of this “production function” is entirely dependent on
endogenous relative prices! Viewed from this perspective, at the household level all
returns to investments are driven by relative prices. Whether this gives rise to a concave
“technology” or not does not depend on technology but on economics, and on economic
equilibrium at that. Yet, we will have something quite definite to say about the curvature of
this production function.
The second conceptual difference, as we shall see below, is that steady state inequality might
remain but history-dependence tends to vanish! Recall in the the two-skill model (see Figure
6.5) that there isn’t just inequality in steady state, there is a continuum of steady states.
Indeed, the dynamics studied in that model take us to different limit points depending on
initial conditions. Thus the two-skill model displays not just persistent inequality, but also
persistent dependence on initial conditions, or on “history”.
It turns out that with a rich set of occupations, this history-dependence vanishes. This
doesn’t happen at the level of an individual dynasty, whose fortunes remain profoundly
linked to the distant past. Rather, it happens to the economy as a whole.
82 The Dynamics of Inequality
6.4.1 The Model. Occupations and Training. There is a compact measurable space H of
occupations that will be used in the production of a single, aggregative final good. There is
an exogenous training cost x(h) for occupation h ∈ H, denominated in units of final output.7
Production. A single aggregate output is produced by physical capital8
and individuals
who hold occupations in H.
Output y (net of the undepreciated capital stock) is produced by a continuous,9
strictly
quasiconcave CRS production function y = f(k, λ), where k is physical capital and λ is
an occupational distribution (a finite measure on H). It is helpful to interpret different
occupations as corresponding to different kinds of human capital.
Prices and Firms. Firms maximize profits at given prices. Normalize the price of final output
to 1. Let w ≡ {w(h)} denote the wage function, and p ≡ (r, w) the factor price function, where
r is the rate of interest. Denote by c(p) the unit cost function.
By constant returns to scale, profit maximization at positive output is possible if and only if
c(p) = 1; in that case call p a supporting price. If (k, λ) is a profit-maximizing choice under the
supporting price p, we will refer to it as an associated input vector.
In these notes, I assume that the rate of interest r is exogenously given and time-stationary.
One simple interpretation is that capital is internationally mobile and that our economy is
a price taker on the world market. Under this interpretation we also assume, in effect, that
people are not internationally mobile: the wage function w will be determined domestically.
See Mookherjee and Ray (2006) for extensions.
Now that r may be treated as a parameter, say that w is a supporting wage if p = (r, w) is a
supporting price.
Families. There is a continuum of families indexed by i ∈ [0, 1]. All families are ex
ante identical, so we endow [0, 1] with Lebesgue measure ν. Each family i has a single
representative at each date or generation, indexed by t. Call this agent (t, i).
Consider a member of generation t. She begins adult life with a financial bequest b and
an occupation h, both “selected” by her parent. The latter is obviously shorthand for the
assumption that the parent bears the costs of upbringing and education (the child can select
the particular occupation with no difference to the formal analysis). The overall wealth
of our generation-t adult is then W ≡ b(1 + r) + wt(h), where wt(h) is the going wage for
occupation h at date t.
The agent correctly anticipates factor prices pt+1 ≡ (r, wt+1) for the next generation t + 1, and
selects her own financial and educational bequests (b
0
, h
0
) to maximize
(6.12) U (W − x(h) − b
0
) + V ((1 + r)b
0 + wt+1(h
0
))
7As in Mookherjee and Ray (2003), this may be generalized to allow training costs to depend on the pattern of
wages. We conjecture that the principal qualitative results of this paper will continue to hold in that setup.
8As long as capital goods are alienable and shares in them can be divisibly held, having several capital goods
makes no difference to the analysis.
9Endow the space of all nonnegative finite measures on H with the topology of weak convergence. We ask that
output be continuous with respect to the product of this topology and the usual topology on k.
The Dynamics of Inequality 83
subject to the no-intergenerational-debt constraint b
0 ≥ 0. We assume that U and V are
smooth, increasing and strictly concave, and that U has unbounded steepness at 0.
Now b
0 and h
0 become the financial and educational inheritance of her child — generation
t + 1 — and the entire process repeats itself ad infinitum.
Clearly, we are using a specification of utility that allows for income-based altruism. More
on this specification later.
The condition b
0 ≥ 0 is a fundamental restriction stating that children cannot be held
responsible for debts incurred by their parents. The capital market is active in all other
senses: households can make financial bequests at the going rate r, and firms can freely hire
in capital at the very same rate.
Equilibrium. Begin with an initial distribution of financial wealth and occupational choices.
A competitive equilibrium given these initial conditions is a sequence of wage functions wt
, t =
0, 1, 2, . . . and occupational distributions λt
, t = 0, 1, 2, . . ., as well as occupational and bequest
choices for each generation in each family—{ht(i), bt(i)}— such that for each t and each family
i:
(a) person (t, i) chooses (bt+1(i), ht+1(i)) to maximize the utility function in (6.12), given that
her own starting wealth equals (1 + r)bt(i) + wt(ht(i));
(b) these decisions aggregate to λt at each t:
λt(H) = ν{i ∈ [0, 1]|ht(i) ∈ H}
for every Borel subset H of occupations, and
(c) wt
is a supporting wage, with associated input vector (λt
, kt) for some choice of kt
.
Observe that equilibrium conditions place no restrictions on kt
. Because there is international
capital mobility, financial holdings by households need bear no relation to capital used in
production.10
A steady state is a competitive equilibrium with stationary prices and distributions; (wt
, λt) =
(w, λ) for all t, and strictly positive output.
The following observation is useful: in steady state, the total wealth of every family, not just
of the economy as a whole, must be stationary.11
Observation 6.3. The wealth of every family is stationary in any steady state.
Proof. This follows directly from Proposition 6.2.
10When there is no international capital mobility, kt must equal the aggregate of financial holdings, and r must
adjust to assure this equalization in equilibrium.
11In general, such an assertion is not true of the financial wealth or the occupational choice of a family, which
may vary over time.
84 The Dynamics of Inequality
6.4.2 The Becker-Tomes Benchmark. A special case of this model is the following
elementary textbook exercise: only financial bequests are possible (earning interest r), and
everyone earns a fixed wage w.
Stochastic shocks apart, this is exactly the specification for the Becker-Tomes (1979) model,
which assumes a linear rate of return to parental investment in children.12 We will henceforth
refer to this special case as the Becker-Tomes benchmark.
In this special case, a parent with wealth W simply selects b ≥ 0 so as to maximize
U (W − b) + V (w + (1 + r)b) .
Let the resulting wealth of the child be denoted W˜ ≡ w + (1 + r)b. We may write W˜ as a
function of W, w and r: W˜ (W; w,r). By our assumptions, W˜ is fully characterized by the first
order conditions
(6.13) U

W −
W˜ − w

(W˜ ),
with equality if W˜ > w.
It is obvious that W˜ (W; w,r) is nondecreasing and continuous in W. So an iteration of this
mapping from any initial condition W > 0 will yield long-run wealth starting from W. Call
this long-run wealth Ω. Passing to the limit in (8.42), it is trivial to see that if w ≤ Ω < ∞,
(6.14) U
0

rΩ + w
1 + r


(Ω), with equality if Ω > w.
Becker and Tomes impose the following restriction on bequest behavior: ∂W˜
∂W
∈ (0, 1),
justifying it by available empirical evidence. This implies that the wealth of all families
will converge to a common limit Ω, independent of initial wealth. To ensure that our larger
model is consistent with this key equalization property of financial bequests, we impose a
similar (though weaker) restriction in this special case:
[LP] Limited Persistence. For any r > −1 and w ≥ 0, there is at most one solution in Ω ≥ w to
(6.14).
As in Becker-Tomes, [LP] also implies that limit wealth Ω(w,r) is well defined and
independent of starting wealth as long as as that starting wealth strictly exceeds w (that
is, as long as starting financial wealth is positive). Given [LP], here is how we define that
limit wealth: Set Ω(w,r) equal to Ω, where Ω solves (6.14), in all cases except the one in
which
U
0

rΩ + w
1 + r


(Ω)
12A more sophisticated version of their model is Becker and Tomes (1986), in which bequests in the form of
human capital are also permitted, but human capital is a priori reduced to efficiency units and it is assumed that
the rate of return to successive units of human capital is declining. In that variant, all families will aim to invest
the (same) amount of human capital before turning to linear financial bequests. Indeed, we do not claim that our
elementary textbook exercise captures the full implications of the Becker-Tomes models. An important theme
in these papers is the interplay between luck and convergence, an issue that is not of relevance here.
The Dynamics of Inequality 85
for all Ω > w, in which case set Ω(w,r) = ∞.
13 The important point is that Ω(w,r) is the same
no matter what the (positive) level of inital wealth is.
This condition is less restrictive than the original Becker-Tomes assumption on ∂W0
∂W
, though
the reader is welcome to keep the stronger restriction in mind (as long as it is understood
that an implicit restriction on the interest rate is also implied thereby).
Condition [LP] is extremely easy to check. The following observation illustrates this by
studying the HARA class of preferences.
Observation 6.4. Suppose preferences satisfy the following restriction: There exists δ > 0 such that
V = δU, and U belongs to the HARA family:
(H) − U00(c)/U0
(c) = 1/(α + βc),
where (α, β) ≥ 0 and nonzero. Then the limited persistence property is satisfied, with the single
exception in which α = 0 and w = 0, in which case it is satisfied for all but one value of r.
Provided that preferences satisfy a constant discount rate property, Observation 6.4 states
that [LP] holds for utility functions that are iso-elastic or exponential, or belong to the HARA
class which nests these as special cases.
It helps to illustrate bequest behavior in the setting with financial bequests alone for the
special case of iso-elastic utility with discounting: U(c) = (c
1−σ − 1)/(1 − σ) with σ > 0, and
V ≡ δU, with δ ∈ (0, 1). Define ρ ≡ [δ(1 + r)]1/σ. Intergenerational wealth movements in the
Becker-Tomes benchmark with stationary (w,r) then takes the form:
W˜ =
(1 + r)ρ
1 + ρ + r
W +
ρ
1 + ρ + r
w
if W ≥
w
ρ
, and W˜ = w otherwise. This allows us to calculate limit wealth:
(6.15) Ω(w,r) =



w if ρ ≤ 1,
ρ
1−r(ρ−1)w if ρ ∈ (1, 1 +
1
r
),
∞ if ρ ≥ 1 +
1
r
.
If ρ ≤ 1, there are no (limiting) financial bequests in steady state in the Becker-Tomes
benchmark, and Ω(r, w) = w. Limit wealth Ω(w,r) is finite only if ρ ∈ (1, 1 +
1
r
).
If r is high enough that this condition is not satisfied, limit wealth is infinite: our version
of the limited persistence property is satisfied,14 whereas the Becker-Tomes version is not.
We only point this out to emphasize that the Becker-Tomes version of limited persistence
imposes more than a restriction on preferences, but in any case we are also fundamentally
interested in the case in which limit wealth is finite.15
13The only subtlety here is one in which (6.14) holds with equality at Ω = w, while the inequality > holds for
all Ω > w. In this case both limits w and ∞ are potential candidates, but the correct limit for starting W > w is
easily seen to be the latter. This is a nongeneric case of little import but in any case our definition handles it.
14Notice that there are two limit wealths in this case, one at infinity and one at zero. But there is only one limit
wealth provided we start with strictly positive wealth, and this is what [LP] requires.
15While the case of unbounded limiting wealth is formally a special case, ongoing growth really calls for a
different model, ideally one in which training costs are endogenous as well.
86 The Dynamics of Inequality
A Comment on Nonpaternalism. We end this section by pointing out that preferences
are inconsistent with the limited persistence assumption. By the envelope theorem, the
derivative of the value function is just the marginal utility of (equilibrium) consumption.
At a steady state, then, these marginal utilities drop out from the Euler equation, and the
conditions become independent of wealth. In particular, an increase in parental steady
state wealth translates into an equal increase in child wealth, so that [LP] fails. Dynastic
preferences do not allow us to take the Becker-Tomes postulates fully on board.
Why do we want to incorporate [LP] in the first place? One answer is that it is empirically
attractive. That may be so, but we do not impose [LP] for this reason. We do so because
we want to show that this assumption generates a form of the steady state wage function
that can never exhibit diminishing returns! If at all that wage function is nonlinear, it must
be nonconvex at least over a region. This shows that the assumption that returns to human
capital must be diminishing (Becker and Tomes (1986)) merits careful scrutiny, to say the
least. None of these points emerge with dynastic preferences, and this — apart from financial
bequests — is another basic difference from the analysis in Mookherjee and Ray (2003).
6.4.3 Two Occupations with No Financial Bequests. In what follows, we study an
extremely simply case, one in which there are just two occupations, and financial bequests
are nonexistent. You can suppose that we are in a world in which Ω(w,r) = w for all w.
Call the two occupations “skilled” and “unskilled” labor. For unskilled labor take the
training cost to be zero. For skilled labor assume that there is a exogenous training cost X,
which is just the number of units of the consumption good used as input into the training
process. Let λ denote the fraction of the population at any date that is skilled. If some
well-behaved production function f (satisfying the usual curvature and Inada end-point
conditions) determines the wage to skill categories, the skilled wage at that date will be
given by w¯(λ) ≡ f1(λ, 1 − λ), while the unskilled wage will be given by
¯
w(λ) ≡ f2(λ, 1 − λ).
where subscripts denote appropriate partial derivatives.16 This yields the following simple
characterization: a fraction λ of skilled people is compatible with a steady state if and only
if
U (w¯(λ)) − u (w¯(λ) − X) ≤ V (w¯(λ) − x) − V (
¯
w(λ))]
≤ U (
¯
w(λ)) − U (
¯
(6.16) w(λ) − X)
The left hand side of (6.16) represents the utility sacrifice of a skilled parent (hereafter
denoted by κ
s
(λ)) in educating its child, while the right hand side is the corresponding
sacrifice for an unskilled parent (denoted by κ
u
(λ)). The term in the middle is the present
value benefit of all successive descendants being skilled rather than unskilled (which we
shall denote by b(λ)).
16This applies only in the unrealistic event that skilled workers cannot perform unskilled tasks. More generally,
if skilled workers can perform unskilled tasks, then the skilled wage cannot ever fall below the unskilled wage.
So when the skill intensity λ is large enough that f1 < f2, wages will not be given by f1 and f2, but will be
equalized (as a result of skilled workers filling unskilled positions whenever the latter pay higher wages). We
omit this minor complication here because a competitive equilibrium with a positive fraction of skilled workers
will never give rise to wage differentials that are incompatible with incentives for parents to educate their
children.

Proposition 6.8. There is a continuum of steady states in the two-profession model with exogenous
training costs, and both per capita income and consumption rise as the skill proportion in steady state
increases.
Proposition 6.8 tells us that multiplicity — in the sense of a continuum of steady states — is
endemic for a small number of professions. While stated only for the two-profession case, it
is easy enough to extend the argument to any finite number of distinct professions.
Notice that the structure of the set of steady states may be complicated. In particular, the set
need not be connected. For instance, in Figure 6.5, the set of steady states is the union of the
two intervals (λ6, λ5) and (λ4, λ3).
The proposition also states that steady states are ordered not only in terms of skill premium
but also per capita income: a steady state with a higher λ and lower skill premium
corresponds to higher per capita income net of training costs. This does not, however,
imply that these steady states are Pareto-ordered. For a detailed discussion of efficiency, see
Mookherjee and Ray (2003).
88 The Dynamics of Inequality
6.4.4 A Rich Set Of Occupations. For a while, now, we shall abandon the idea of just two
occupations and go to the opposite extreme, in which we examine what happens with a rich
set of occupations. Two assumptions characterize richness:
[R.1] The set of all possible training costs is a compact interval of the form [0, X].
[R.2] For every subset C ⊆ [0, X] of positive Lebesgue measure, if the occupational
distribution has zero value over every occupation h with x(h) ∈ C, then no output can
be produced.
Thus we don’t ask that every occupation be essential, only that (almost) every training cost
in [0, X] has an essential occupation attached to it. Observe that conditions [R.1] and [R.2]
really go together as a pair: without some restriction like [R.2], [R.1] can always be trivially
met by simply inventing useless occupations to fill up the gaps in training costs.
Together, [R.1] and [R.2] imply that whenever positive output is produced, the inhabited
range of “equilibrium training costs” is always equal to [0, X].
We justify richness by noting that while there are large differences in training costs between
unskilled occupations (such as farm workers or manual jobs) and skilled occupations (such as
engineers, doctors and lawyers), there are also many semi-skilled occupations (technicians,
nurses and clerks) with intermediate training costs and wages. Besides, there are large
differences in the quality of education within any given occupation, which translate into
corresponding differences in education costs and wages.
The methodological innovation in the richness asumption is that it allows families to fully
fine-tune their investments. Whether or not their investment set is convex depends, then,
not on assumed indivisibilities in training costs but in the endogenously determined factor
price schedule.
Note that [R.1] includes a bit more than occupational richness. It states that there is an
occupation with zero training cost, a restriction that we impose for expositional ease.
6.4.5 Steady States With Rich Occupations. Fix a steady state. Say that an occupation
(or training cost) is inhabited if some family chooses that occupation (or incurs that training
cost). By the richness conditions, we know that every steady state (which has positive output,
by definition) must exhibit a full measure of inhabited training costs. Suppose that we can
alter the wage function on the small set of uninhabited occupations without changing any of
the observed features of the steady state. Then we will say that the new steady state wage
function (which only differs by specifying different wages for uninhabited occupations) is
an equivalent representation of the old.
One particular representation is of interest, in which all occupations with the same training
cost command the same wage. In that case (though with some abuse of notation), we shall
go back and forth between w(h) and the representation w(x).
Proposition 6.9. Assume [R.1], [R.2] and [LP].
(a) Every steady state has an equivalent representation with a continuous wage function.
The Dynamics of Inequality 89
(b) In an equal steady state, this equivalent representation may be described as follows: there exists
w ≥ 0 such that
(6.17) w(x) = w + (1 + r)x
for all x. In that steady state, all families attain a common wealth of Ω(w,r), and
(6.18) X ≤
Ω(w,r) − w
1 + r
,
where X is the highest training cost across all occupations.
(b) In an unequal steady state, the equivalent representation may be described as a two-phase wage
function: there exists w ≥ 0 and θ ∈ [0, X) such that for all occupations h with x(h) ≤ θ, (6.17)
holds:
w(h) = w + (1 + r)x(h).
Families that choose any of these occupations at any date all attain a common wealth of Ω(w,r) that
is precisely equal to w(θ).
On the other hand, for all occupations h with x(h) > θ, w and x are connected via the following
differential equation:
(6.19) w
0
(x) =
U0
(w(x) − x)
V0
(w(x)) .
with endpoint constraint that the wage at cost θ equals w(θ) = w + (1 + r)θ.
Families in such occupations attain a wealth that is strictly greater than Ω(w,r), and the marginal
rate of return to these occupations, w0
(x), strictly exceeds 1 + r almost everywhere.
The outline of the argument is as follows. Since (almost) every training cost must have
at least one inhabited occupation, the marginal rate of return on training costs must be at
least r everywhere. In other words, the presence of human capital allows parents to transfer
wealth to their children at (weakly) lower cost than in a Becker-Tomes benchmark where
only financial bequests are possible. Hence every family must attain at least the wealth
Ω(w,r) that would have arisen in the latter context (corresponding to the flow wage w that
is available to every generation even in the absence of any educational investment). In an
equal steady state, the rate of return on human capital at all levels is exactly r, so that the set
of investment options is exactly the same as in a Becker-Tomes benchmark with stationary
(w,r). Therefore all families attain precisely the wealth Ω(w,r).
Finally, equation (6.18) must hold in such a steady state, because the occupation with the
highest training cost X must have a wage of w + (1 + r)X, and must be willingly chosen by
some family.
In an unequal steady state it is trivial to see that the rate of return to some occupation must
then exceed r. If not, the set of investment options would be just as in a Becker-Tomes
benchmark with financial bequests alone, and wealth equality is then the only possible
long-run outcome.
What is more subtle is the exact form the wage function must take. The proposition claims
that the wage function has two phases. For low-end occupations, financial and human
90 The Dynamics of Inequality
rates of return coincide and the wage function is linear. This phase has an endogenous
delineation: any occupation with training cost below the steady state financial bequest in
the Becker-Tomes benchmark with (w,r) must generate a rate of return of exactly r. (Note
well that w, the lowest wage, is endogenous.)
For occupations with training costs that exceed the Becker-Tomes steady state bequest, the
rates of return must be high enough to induce willing settlement. This requirement creates
at least a local nonconvexity of the steady state wage function: the marginal rates of return
to such occupations will exceed r.
A closer inspection of the differential equation (6.19) reveals that the shape of the wage
function in the second phase relies entirely on preferences. To be sure (and as we shall see
more clearly below), the existence and range of this phase will depend, among other things,
on the technology. For a large class of preferences, the wage function exhibits a “global”
nonconvexity, in the sense that the marginal rate of return rises monotonically with training
costs beyond θ.
Observation 6.5. Consider either the constant elasticity case with U(c) = (c
1−σ − 1)/(1 − σ), σ > 0,
or the case of exponential utility U(c) = −exp(−αc), α > 0, and V ≡ δU. Then the marginal rate of
return on occupations monotonically increases with training cost beyond the boundary θ described
in Proposition 6.9.
In the case of exponential utility, the wage function takes the form (for x > θ):
(6.20) w(x) =
1
δα exp(αx) + Ω(w,r) −
1
δα exp(αθ).
In the constant elasticity case w0
(x) monotonically increases to a finite asymptote that strictly exceeds
1 + r.
This description stands the traditional theory on its head. That theory presumes — usually
by assumption — that the rates of return to human capital must be declining in training
cost (see, for instance, Loury (1981) and Becker and Tomes (1986)). Therefore the poorer
families make all the human capital investment, and once families are rich enough so that
the marginal return on human capital falls to the constant rate assumed for financial capital,
all other bequests are financial.
In contrast, Proposition 6.9 is stated in a context in which the relative earnings of different
occupations are allowed depend on the occupational distribution, for which there is
considerable empirical evidence (e.g., Katz and Murphy (1992)). The proposition then asserts
that the theory endogenously generates rates of return that run counter to the assumptions
made in the literature. Financial bequests are made at the low end, while “occupational
bequests” carry a higher rate of return and are made by richer families. If a rich set of
occupations is essential, the concavity of returns to human capital is never an equilibrium
outcome in any unequal steady state.
As an aside, we note that we haven’t yet provided conditions for a steady state to be unequal,
but will soon proceed to an analysis of this question.

Figure 6.6. A Extension to Three Phases
It is important to see that the predicted shape of steady state wage functions depend
fundamentally on the limited persistence assumption. If several occupations are essential in
steady state, then to sustain the “wealth-spreading” necessitated by those occupations and
to counteract convergence, wage functions must display a nonconvexity. A dynastic model,
such as the one studied in Mookherjee and Ray (2003), fails [LP] and cannot deliver this
property of wage functions in steady state.
Are our predictions counterfactual? We think not. First, it is well known from inequality
decomposition studies that earnings inequality accounts for most of overall income inequality.
For instance, Fields (2004) summarizes observations from several studies, writing that
that “labor income inequality is as important or more important than all other income sources
combined in explaining total income inequality”.
Second, there is evidence that within the class of financial bequests, which are admittedly
large for rich families, intentional bequests are not important. For instance, Gokhale et
al (2001) argue that most financial bequests in the US economy are unintentional, the
result of premature death and imperfect annuitization. In the iso-elastic example, this
would correspond to the case with ρ below unity. Our theory then predicts that there are
no intentional bequests anywhere in the wealth distribution, so human capital differences
entirely account for all inequality, perhaps supplemented by unintended financial bequests
(which we do not formally model).17
Third, it is important to remember that by “occupations”, we mean not just human capital but
every productive activity that is inalienable. This includes human capital but it is certainly
not restricted to it. In particular, it is possible to view large financial bequests observed at
the top end of the distribution as a form of occupational investment by parents, in the form
of transfer of ownership or control of (partly inalienable) business activities.
17For a model of unintended bequests arising from uncertain life span, see, e.g., Fuster (2000).
92 The Dynamics of Inequality
Finally, it is easy to generate variants of this model which exhibit financial bequests at both
upper and lower ends of the wealth distribution. For instance, suppose that financial wealth
can be left at two rates of return: one at the existing rate r and another at a higher rate r
0
, only
accessible when the level of financial bequests crosses some threshold. Then it can be shows
(I do not do this here) that in general, a steady state wage function will have a “three-phase
property”. Phases I and II look just like they do in this proposition. In phase III there is a
return to linearity, this time at the higher rate r
0
. Financial bequests are left at both ends of
the wealth distributrion. Figure 6.6 illustrates.
6.4.6 Existence and Uniqueness With Richness. Existence. Having gained an understanding
of the structure of steady states in this model, we can now provide conditions on
the technology and preferences that guarantee the existence of a steady state.
Our definition of a steady state includes the requirement that output must be positive, so that
existence is typically nontrivial. Proposition 6.9 informs us that a steady state must assume
a particular form. In fact, it is easy to see that given some baseline wage w for unskilled labor,
that proposition fully pins down the wage function. The only scope for variation lies in w. It
comes as no surprise, then, that the existence of a (nondegenerate) steady state depends on
the economy being productive enough to sustain positive profit at one of these conceivable
wage functions.18
Of course, that isn’t enough. Proposition 6.9 describes what a steady state necessarily looks
like, but is silent on the question of whether such a description is indeed sufficient for all the
steady state conditions. This, too, will need to be addressed.
We proceed, then, by searching for a steady state using the features described in Proposition
6.9. To this end, we describe the family of all two-phase wage functions. Start with a given
baseline wage of w, and set w(x) = w + (1 + r)x for all training costs no greater than
θ(w) ≡ min{
Ω(w,r) − w
1 + r
, X}.
(This corresponds to the old threshold θ used in Proposition 6.9, but now we make the
dependence on w explicit.) For occupations with higher training costs — if any — the wage
function is set to satisfy the differential equation (6.19):
w
0
(x)) =
U0
(w(x) − x)
V0
(w(x)) ,
with the endpoint constraint that the wage for training cost θ(w) equals w + (1 + r)θ(w), or
equivalently, Ω(w,r).
18There is a family resemblance here to the existence of steady states in the multisectoral optimal growth model,
which requires a “productivity condition” (see Khan and Mitra (1986)). Fixed point arguments that neglect such
a productivity condition, as in Sutherland (1970), are bound to fail because they do not eliminate the trivial
outcome with zero output and wealth all around.
The Dynamics of Inequality 93
This procedure generates a unique wage function corresponding to any choice of w. Repeat
this procedure for every w ≥ 0: we now have the entire two-phase family, with either one of
the phases conceivably degenerate.19
Given what we know already, the following “productivity” condition is necessary for the
existence of a steady state with positive output:
[P] Unit costs c(r, w) are less than or equal to 1 for some two-phase wage function.
It is easy enough to rewrite [P] as a productivity condition. For instance, if the production
function is written as A f(f, λ), where A is some Hicks-neutral productivity parameter, [P]
states simply that A is large enough.
As the following proposition reveals, condition P (in conjunction with the other maintained
assumptions) is also sufficient for the existence of a steady state with positive output.20
Proposition 6.10. Under [R.1], [R.2], and [LP], a steady state with positive output exists if and
only if [P] is satisfied.
Condition [P] isn’t at all difficult to verify, one way or the other. As an example, suppose
that each training cost x corresponds to a unique occupation (so name it x as well), and that
the production function takes the Cobb-Douglas form
ln y = (1 − α) ln k +
Z X
0
α(x) ln(λ(x))dx + ln A,
where A is a productivity parameter, α(x) ≥ 0 and R
α(x)dx = α ∈ (0, 1). Then it is easy to see
that for any wage function w,
ln c(r, w) = (1 − α)[ln r − ln(1 − α)] +
Z X
0
α(x)[ln(w(x)) − ln(α(x))]dx − ln A.
The verification of [P] therefore simply entails the choice of a wage function that minimizes
R
α(x)w(x), and then checking whether the resulting expression above is nonpositive.
Uniqueness. Proposition 6.9 already takes a significant step towards uniqueness by
establishing that any steady state wage function, or at least its continuous equivalent
representation, must lie in the two-phase class. As described in detail earlier, it is linear
with return r over a range of training costs, and then displays a marginal rate of return
that strictly exceeds r. In a broad class of cases (see, e.g. Observation 6.5), this marginal
return can be shown to be ever-increasing, though it will usually possess a finite asymptote.
Finally, the training-cost threshold separating the two phases precisely corresponds to the
Becker-Tomes limit bequest with wage equal to the lowest wage along this function.
19If θ(w) = X, the second phase is degenerate. Remember that at w = 0, Ω(0,r) is the limit of Ω(w,r) as w ↓ 0. It
may or may not equal 0, which is always trivially a limit wealth. If it is, the first phase is degenerate.
20If [P] fails, it is easy to construct a steady state with zero output: simply construct the two-phase wage function
that starts from a baseline wage of zero, and place all individuals in the zero-wage occupation.
94 The Dynamics of Inequality
To be sure, the same economic fundamentals are consistent — at least in principle — with
several wage functions drawn from this two-phase class. But this is what the uniqueness
proposition rules out.
Proposition 6.11. Assume [R.1], [R.2], and [LP]. Then, apart from equivalent representations
which change no observed outcome, there is at most one steady state.
As already discussed, this uniqueness proposition has far-ranging implications. Apart from
Mookherjee and Ray (2003), to be discussed in more detail below, this observation has gone
unnoticed in the literature because the literature typically concentrates on a sparse set of
occupations (usually two, as in Galor and Zeira (1993) or occasionally three, as in Banerjee
and Newman (1993)). In such cases multiplicity is indeed endemic, but once the set of
occupations expands such multiplicity must shrink. We reiterate that the expansion of the
set of occupations does not convexify the set of choices. Indeed, as Proposition 6.9 takes
pains to explain, equilibrium nonconvexity is the rule rather than the exception.
Following up on this point, our uniqueness proposition does not rule out the pathdependence
of economic fortunes for individual families. The identities of those who inhabit
the different occupational slots is up for grabs and may — will — depend on historical
accident. But their numbers cannot.
Proposition 6.11 is a substantial extension of the uniqueness theorem in Mookherjee and Ray
(2003) to a context in which financial capital co-exists with human capital. Indeed, given the
simplified context of our model,21 the uniqueness result of Mookherjee and Ray (2003) can
be seen very easily and intuitively.
Imagine reworking Proposition 6.9 by imposing the additional constraint that no financial
bequests are permitted. One would reasonably suppose, then, that the first phase of the twophase
function would disappear, and that any steady state wage function must be governed
by the differential equation (6.19) throughout. Now it is easy to see why there can be only
one such wage function. If we begin at two different initial conditions and apply (6.19)
thereafter, the two wage trajectories cannot cross — a well-known property for this class
of differential equations. In short, if there are two steady state wage functions, one must lie
entirely above the other. But now we have a contradiction, for two wage functions ordered in
this way cannot both serve as bonafide supporting prices for profit maximization. We obtain
uniqueness when there are no financial bequests.
While this serves as some intuition for the result at hand, different considerations emerge
when financial bequests are permitted. Now crossings of the two putative steady state wage
functions cannot be ruled out by taking recourse to uniqueness theorems for differential
equations. After all, the behavior of the wage functions is not governed throughout by
(6.19); a nontrivial “first phase” makes an appearance. Instead, the formal proof must rely
on behavioral arguments, based on household optimization, to rule out such crossings.
21Apart from the central difference of financial bequests, there are two differences between our model and that
of Mookherjee and Ray (2003). First, they use a nonpaternalistic bequest motive and work with value functions.
Second, training costs are endogenously determined in their model. However, these differences are minor and
can be readily accommodated.
The Dynamics of Inequality 95
6.4.7 Conditions for Inequality. We are now in a position a key question: under what
conditions does the steady state of the model involve inequality rather than equality? In the
language of Proposition 6.9, when must the second phase of the two-phase wage function
necessarily be nonempty?
A simple preliminary exercise lays the groundwork for a complete characterization of this
question. This exercise concerns the production technology alone and has nothing to do
with preferences.
Consider the class of all linear wage functions of the form w(x) = w + (1 + r)x defined on all
of [0, X], parameterized by w ≥ 0.
Observation 6.6. Assume [P]. Then there is a unique value of w — call it a — and a corresponding
linear wage function w∗ with w∗
(x) = a + (1 + r)x for all x — such that c(r, w∗
) = 1.
Now a isn’t an explicit parameter of our model. But for all intents and purposes it is an
exogenous primitive. To compute a all one needs is a knowledge of the production function.
As an example, recall the Cobb-Douglas case studied in Section ??, in which each training
cost corresponds to a single occupation: Cobb-Douglas form
ln y = (1 − α) ln k +
Z X
0
α(x) ln(λ(x))dx.
Using the same logic as in that case, it is easy to see that a must solve the equation
(1 − α)[ln r − ln(1 − α)] +
Z X
0
α(x)[ln(a + [1 + r]x) − ln(α(x))]dx = 0,
provided that condition P holds.
We are now in a position to state our central result concerning persistent inequality.
Proposition 6.12. Under [R.1], [R.2], [LP], and [P], the unique steady state is unequal if and only
if
(6.21) Ω(a,r) < a + (1 + r)X.
We shall refer to the inequality (6.21) as the widespan condition. It is made up of two parts. As
we noted above, the parameter a is entirely a feature of the production technology and the
range of the occupational structure. On the other hand, the Becker-Tomes limit wealth map
Ω is entirely a feature of preferences. The widespan condition states that Becker-Tomes limit
wealth — commencing from a — is not enough to “span” the entire range of occupations:
it (net of a and discounted by the interest rate) is smaller than the span X. Proposition 6.12
declares that in all such cases, the steady state must exhibit persistent inequality.
One should be careful enough to note that (6.21) may not prescribe a unique threshold for
the span X. Such an interpretation is suggested by the rewriting of the condition as
X >
Ω(a,r) − a
1 + r
,
96 The Dynamics of Inequality
but observe that both a and X depend on the training cost technology. To make this a more
precise, consider economies that are identical in all respects except for their training cost
functions, which are drawn from an ordered family (all starting at 0 for some occupation).
Such an ordered family may be parameterized by the highest training cost X.
In this class, it is very easy to see that a depends negatively on X. Therefore provided
that Ω(w,r)− w is nondecreasing in w, we do generate a single-threshold restriction on span:
“there is X
∗
such that widespan holds if and only if X > X
∗”. This will be true, for instance, for
isoelastic preferences: see (6.22) and the accompanying discussion below. More generally,
though, widespan must hold for all training costs large enough (even though (6.21) may not
imply a single threshold for X).
Uniqueness plus widespan tells us that there is just one steady state, but it must treat
individuals unequally. Conversely, if widespan fails, there is convergence to a common level
of wealth for all families. The proposition asserts, therefore, that whether the disequalization
or the equalization view of the market is relevant depends on whether or not the widespan
condition is satisfied.
Observe that under widespan, the market must act to separate identical or near-identical
families, as described informally in Section ??. Long-run equality is not an option. However,
this paper does not contain an explicit account of dynamic equilibria from non-steady-state
initial conditions.
The discussion following the statement of Proposition 6.11 continues to be relevant here.
There is no history-dependence “in the large”, as the steady state is unique. But just where
an individual family will end up in that distribution profoundly depends on the distant
history of that family.
The strength of the characterization result in Proposition 6.9 is such that it renders the proof
of this proposition almost trivial. See Appendix.
6.4.8 Applications and Implications. To illustrate the implications of the span condition
in Proposition 6.12, it is useful to invoke the example of an iso-elastic utility function.
Recall, in particular, equation (6.15) and the discussion following it. If δ ≤
1
1+r
, (6.21) is
always satisfied and an equal steady state never exists. There are effectively no financial
bequests in the limit, so the model reduces to the disequalization model in which financial
bequests are not allowed. If, on the other hand, δ ≥ 1 +
1
r
then Ω(a,r) = ∞ and (6.21) fails.
Financial bequests overwhelm any inequality arising from the need to provide occupational
choice incentives, and an unequal steady state cannot exist.
In the intermediate case in which δ is neither too large nor too small, (6.15) tells us that
Ω(a,r) =
ρ
1 − r(ρ − 1)a,
where ρ ≡ [δ(1 + r)]1/σ, so that the widespan condition reduces to
ρ
1 − r(ρ − 1)a < a + (1 + r)X.
The Dynamics of Inequality 97
Rearranging, we obtain the following version of widespan:
(6.22) X > a
ρ − 1
1 − r(ρ − 1)
We now describe effects of varying parameters of the model, which are relevant to explaining
cross-country differences, or effects of technological change.
(a) Differences in TFP Levels. Suppose we compare two countries which differ only in their
levels of total factor productivity (TFP). Then for any common value of X, the poorer country
has a lower value of a, implying that it is more prone to disequalization. Intuitively, the
lower level of wages reduces the intensity of the parental bequest motive: they are less
willing to undertake the educational investments for high-end occupations. The resulting
shortage of people in high-end occupations causes a rise in the skill premium. This elicits
the requires supply into high-end occupations, but makes wealth inequality more acute.
Technologically poorer countries are therefore more prone to disequalization.
Of course, this argument is based partly on the assumption that the range of training costs X
is unaffected by wages. However, it is easy to incorporate this extension under the plausible
assumption that both human and physical inputs enter into production. Then X lower in the
unproductive country, but not by the same factor as a. This argument is obviously reinforced
if poorer countries also possess a less productive educational technology.
(b) Differences in TFP Growth Rates. While TFP-related differences in poverty are positively
associated with disequalization, higher growth may be positively related to it as well. For
instance, if growth (from Hicks-neutral technical progress) causes all wages and costs to
grow at a uniform rate, then — all other things being equal — the level of desired bequests
will be dulled, raising the likelihood of disequalization.22
To the extent that poorer countries grow faster owing to a “catch-up” phenomenon in
technology, the widespan condition is therefore more likely to hold on two counts: higher
poverty and higher growth. Of course, the net result is ambiguous if subsequent growth
isn’t positively correlated with initial poverty.
(c) Changes in Interest Rates. A change in the rate of return to capital has subtle effects. When
r rises, ρ also goes up. Both these effects work against the widespan condition, by raising the
rate of return to financial bequests. So a first cut at this issue would suggest that an increase
in the global rate of return to physical capital tends to be equality-enhancing. However,
there is the possibility that a may be lowered by the increase in r. This effect runs in the
opposite direction, and a full analysis is yet to be conducted.
(d) Reliance on Physical Capital Now let us compare economies with differing degrees of
mechanization, i.e., reliance on physical capital vis-a-vis human capital in production. One
22We omit a formal demonstration of this assertion, which proceeds by deriving an equivalent of the widespan
condition (6.22) in the presence of neutral technical progress.
98 The Dynamics of Inequality
simple way to do this is to suppose that final output is produced via a nested function
y = Akαm
1−α
,
where m is a composite of the occupational inputs: e.g., an intermediate good “produced”
by workers. Then greater mechanization corresponds to a rise in α. Setting the marginal
product of capital to the interest rate r, we obtain
k
m

Notice that B essentially prices the composite in terms of the final output. If B goes down
for some reason, then w(0) will decline. So a reduction in B, other things being equal, will
contribute to a greater likelihood of disequalization. Whether B goes up or down with α
depends on the ratio of A (TFP) to r.
23 In relatively “unproductive” economies in which A
is small, an increase in physical capital intensity lowers B, making inequality more likely.
The opposite is the case in “productive” economies in which A is large. We thus obtain an
interesting answer to a classic question in the theory of distribution: the impact of greater
mechanization in production on long-run inequality.
(e) Wider Product Variety. Wider occupational spans may be the outcome of introduction
of new goods and services, owing to technological change. The production of new goods
and services such as information and communication technology creates an entirely new
set of occupations. Such occupations are likely to require high levels of education and
training, which may be thought of as an increase in the span of occupations and associated
training costs. Unlike the parameterization used in Proposition 6.12, such changes involve
an increase both in X and in the productivity of the technology. In terms of (6.22), both X
and a tend to rise and the net effect depends on the ratio of these two variables.
We have not yet analyzed this application in detail, but it is clear that the effect of wider
product variety on inequality is a very important question.
(f) When (6.21) holds, the rising rate of return to occupations (as captured by Observation
6.5) is an important prediction of the theory. We have discussed this already, but it bears
repetition that this derived property of the model contradicts the assumed properties of human
capital in Becker and Tomes (1986) and others. Empirical research will take us closer to
settling this issue.
23The intuitive reason why this is the appropriate comparison is that A becomes the productivity of capital in
the limiting case when α = 1.

6.4.9 A Summary. We’ve addressed two central questions in the theory of income distribution:
[I] Do competitive markets equalize or disequalize wealth allocations?
[II] Does history matter? Are the same economic fundamentals consistent with multiple
steady states?
We study a model of intergenerational bequests which allows for both financial bequests
as well the choice of a rich variety of occupations. A fundamental postulate of the model
is that occupational inputs are imperfect substitutes, so that factor prices are endogenously
determined. At the level of an individual household, occupational investments may be
fine-tuned to an arbitrary degree, provided that there is rich variation in occupations and
training costs. But the returns to these occupations are endogenous, and the equilibrium
of the market will determine whether households face a convex or nonconvex investment
technology.
We provide a complete characterization of steady states. We show that if there is inequality
in steady state (so that question I has been answered affirmatively), then the steady state
wage function must be linear over a section and convex over others, so that each family
must face an investment nonconvexity. This finding is at sharp odds with existing literature
that simply assumes the opposite: that the rate of retrun to human capital must exhibit
diminishing returns.
Our characterization permits us to move on to the two central questions. We prove that with
a rich set of occupations, the steady state must be unique. There may (and generally will)
be path-dependence at the level of dynastic choices, but the overall distribution of outcomes
must be independent of history. This provides an interesting negative answer to question
II, and in this way challenges a literature that is predicated on steady state multiplicity.
The second principal goal is to address question I: we extend and unify three seemingly
different views of market-driven inequality: equalization, embodied in traditional theories of
income distribution, disequalization, central to the recent endogenous inequality literature,
and neutrality, that either can happen depending on historical conditions. We show that a
fundamental condition, which we call the widespan condition, allows us to predict whether
the steady state must involve inequality or not.
The widespan condition draws attention to an aspect of technology that has received little
attention in the literature: the range or “span” of occupational structure. Whether equality
or inequality results from market mechanisms depends on this key parameter representing
the extent of occupational diversity, relative to the strength of bequests.
The theory has several potential applications and implications.
We end with a final comment on question II. Our uniqueness result stems from the assumed
richness in occupational investments. Whether or not such richness exists therefore deserves
to be studied empirically. If the assumption is valid, theories of macroeconomic history
dependence will have to be based either on interest rate multiplicities rooted in the lack
100 The Dynamics of Inequality
of capital market integration, or political economy channels, rather than market-based
occupational choice mechanisms.
6.4.10 Proofs. Proof of Proposition 6.7. Define κ¯(λ) ≡ u(w¯(λ))−u(w¯(λ)−x); this is the utility
cost of acquiring education when the parent is high. Define a similar utility cost for the low
parent:
¯
κ(λ) ≡ u(
¯
w(λ)) − u(
¯
w(λ) − x). Let b(λ) ≡ u(w¯ − x) − u(
¯
w) be the one-period gain to
being high (assuming that the high parent also invests in her child and the low parent does
not), and define B(λ) ≡ (1 − δ)
−1
b(λ).
Finally, for any sequence {λs} and for any date t, define
Bt ≡
X∞
s=t
δ
s−t
b(λs).
This is the lifetime gain between a currently high and a currently low dynasty (starting from
any date t), assuming that dynasties never switch their skill status.
The reason why Bt acquires salience is given by the following simple observation, which
states that at every date, the equilibrium lifetime utility of the high (and low) must be equal
to the utility they would have received were their descendants never to switch status. [To be
sure, along the equilibrium path, switching of status will generally occur nevertheless.]
Lemma 6.1. If {w¯t

t=0
is a competitive equilibrium, then for each date t,
(6.23) V¯
t =

δ
s−tu(w¯s − x)
and
(6.24)
¯
Vt =

s−tu(

so that in particular,
(6.25) V¯
t −
¯
Vt = Bt for all t.
Proof. It suffices to show that for each t ≥ 0,
V¯
t = u(w¯t − x) + δV¯
t+1
and
¯
Vt = u(
¯
wt
) + δ
¯
Vt+1
.
To prove this, apply Observations 6.1 and 6.2. By Observation 6.1 and our restriction on
λ0, λt ∈ (0, λ˜) for all t ≥ 0. Now using Observation 6.2, we may conclude that at all dates,
some of the high people stay high, while some of the low people stay low. This is enough to
establish the result.
Thus along any competitive equilibrium, no dynasty will strictly prefer to switch skills,
though it may well be the case that it strictly prefers to stay where it is. Lemma 6.1 yields,
in turn
The Dynamics of Inequality 101
Lemma 6.2. If {w¯t

is a competitive equilibrium, then for every t, (w¯t

) are the wages
associated with λt

(6.26) κ¯(λt) ≤ δBt+1 ≤

with
(6.27) λt+1 > λt only if δBt+1 =
¯
κ(λt)
and
(6.28) λt+1 < λt only if δBt+1 = κ¯(λt)
Proof. Let {w¯t
,
¯
wt
, λt} be a competitive equilibrium. Then by definition, (w¯t
,
¯
wt
) must be the
wages associated with λt for every t. Using (6.23) and utility maximization, we see that
V¯
t =

s−tu(w¯s − x) ≥ u(w¯t) + δ

so that (using (6.23) again)
u(w¯t) − u(w¯t − x) ≤ δ[V¯
t+1 −

]
with equality holding whenever a switch from “high” to “low” does occur along the
equilibrium path. Invoking (6.25) of Lemma 6.1, we get half of (6.26) as well as (6.28).
The same argument applied to a currently low dynasty gets us the other half of (6.26) and
(6.27).
The next step is central:
Lemma 6.3. If {w¯t
,
¯
wt
, λt}
∞
t=0
is a competitive equilibrium, then for every t,
(6.29) max{B(λt),
1
δ
κ¯(λt)} ≥ Bt+1 ≥ min{B(λt),
1
δ ¯
κ(λt)}.
Proof. It suffices to prove the result for t = 0. I first show that
(6.30) max{B(λ0),
1
δ
κ¯(λ0)} ≥ B1
Suppose this assertion is false. Then I claim that there exists a first date T ≥ 0 such that
λ0 = · · · = λT and
(6.31) BT+1 ≥
1
δ ¯
κ(λT).
Of course, if B1 ≥ (1/δ)
¯
κ(λ0), the claim is automatically true; otherwise B1 < (1/δ)
¯
κ(λ0). We
also have (by virtue of the presumption that (6.30) does not hold) that B1 > (1/δ)κ¯(λ0), so
that
1
δ ¯
κ(λ0) < B1 <
1
δ
κ¯(λ0)
102 The Dynamics of Inequality
which — by Lemma 6.2 — implies that λ0 = λ1. Moreover, B1 = b(λ1) + δB2 = b(λ0) + δB2,
while B(λ0) = b(λ0) + δB(λ0), so that
B2 − B(λ0) =
1
δ
[B1 − B(λ0)],
and simple manipulation of this equality shows that
(6.32) B2 = B1 +
1 − δ
δ
,
where  ≡ B1 − B(λ0) > 0 (again, by the failure of (6.30)).
Following the same reasoning leading up to (6.32), as long as Bt+1 < (1/δ)
¯
κ(λt) — and as
long as this is also true of all dates before t — we have λ0 = · · · = λt = λt+1, and
(6.33) Bt+1 = Bt +
1 − δ
δ
,
It follows that there must be a first date T such that λ0 = · · · = λT, and (6.31) holds, as
claimed.
On the other hand, (6.31) cannot hold with strict inequality, as this would surely violate
(6.26) of Lemma 6.2, so it must be that
(6.34) BT+1 =
1
δ ¯
κ(λT).
In turn, this means that λT+1 ≥ λT (see (6.28)). Moreover, δBT+2 = BT+1 − b(λT+1), so that
δBT+2 −
¯
κ(λT+1) = BT+1 − b(λT+1) −
¯
κ(λT+1)
≥ BT+1 − b(λT) −
¯
κ(λT)
= BT+1 − b(λT) − δBT+1
(6.35) = BT+1 − BT > 0,
which contradicts (6.26) at date T + 1. This establishes (6.30).
Now we prove that
(6.36) B1 ≥ min{B(λ0),
1
δ ¯
κ(λ0)}
The argument runs closely parallel to the previous one. Suppose (6.36) is false. Then I claim
that there exists a first date T ≥ 0 such that λ0 = · · · = λT and
(6.37) BT+1 ≤
1
δ
κ¯(λT).
The steps are very similar to those used to establish (6.31), and are omitted.
Continuing the parallel argument, (6.37) cannot hold with strict inequality, so we have
(6.38) BT+1 =
1
δ
κ¯(λT).
In turn, this means that λT+1 ≤ λT. These two observations establish, however, that
δBT+2 − κ¯(λT+1) < 0,
The Dynamics of Inequality 103
(following steps parallel to those establishing (6.35)), which contradicts (6.26) and completes
the proof of the lemma.
The following observation is a simple consequence of Lemma 6.3:
Lemma 6.4. Along any equilibrium, if B(λt) ≤ (1/δ)κ¯(λt), then Bt+1 = (1/δ)κ¯(λt). Similarly, if
B(λt) ≥ (1/δ)
¯
κ(λt), then Bt+1 = (1/δ)
¯
κ(λt).
Proof. We prove the first part; the second part uses a completely analogous argument. If
B(λt) ≤ (1/δ)κ¯(λt), then max{B(λt), (1/δ)κ¯(λt)} = (1/δ)κ¯(λt), so that by (6.29), (1/δ)κ¯(λt) ≥
Bt+1. On the other hand, Lemma 6.2 tells us that (1/δ)κ¯(λt) ≤ Bt+1, and the proof is complete.
With these steps in hand, we may complete the proof of the theorem. There are three
possibilities to consider (each a restriction on the initial value λ0):
I. (1/δ)κ¯(λ0) < B(λ0) < (1/δ)
¯
κ(λ0). Then by (6.29), B(λ0) = B1. In particular,
(1/δ)κ¯(λ0) < B1 < (1/δ)
¯
κ(λ0)
so that by Lemma 6.2, λ0 = λ1. Continuing the argument recursively, we see that λt = λ0 for
all t.
II. B(λ0) ≤ (1/δ)κ¯(λ0). Then by Lemma 6.4, B1 = (1/δ)κ¯(λ0) and so by Lemma 6.2, λ1 ≤ λ0.
Suppose, in fact, that strict inequality holds. Then (1/δ)κ¯(λ1) < (1/δ)κ¯(λ0) and (1/δ)
¯
κ(λ1) >
(1/δ)
¯
κ(λ0), so that
(6.39) (1/δ)
¯
κ(λ1) > B1 > (1/δ)κ¯(λ1).
Now I claim that in fact,
(6.40) (1/δ)
¯
κ(λ1) > B(λ1) > (1/δ)κ¯(λ1).
Suppose not. First suppose that B(λ1) ≤ (1/δ)κ¯(λ1). Then by Lemma 6.4, B2 ≤ (1/δ)κ¯(λ1), so
that B1 = (1 − δ)B(λ1) + δB2 ≤ (1/δ)κ¯(λ1), which contradicts (6.39). In exactly the same way,
one can rule out the possibility that B(λ1) ≥ (1/δ)
¯
κ(λ1), so (6.40) is established.
Now we are in Case I, and λ must remain constant thereafter. So in Case II, we move to a
steady state in at most one step.
III. B(λ0) ≥ (1/δ)
¯
κ(λ0). Then by Lemma 6.4, B1 = (1/δ)
¯
κ(λ0) and so by Lemma 6.2, λ1 ≥ λ0.
To bring out the contrast with Case II, I claim that B(λ1) ≥ (1/δ)
¯
κ(λ1), with strict inequality
if the corresponding inequality at date 0 also holds strictly.
Suppose on the contrary that B(λ1) < (1/δ)
¯
κ(λ1). Then
(6.41) B1 = (1/δ)
¯
κ(λ0) ≥ (1/δ)
¯
κ(λ1) > B(λ1),
while it is also true that
(6.42) B1 = (1/δ)
¯
κ(λ0) ≥ (1/δ)
¯
κ(λ1) ≥ B2.
But (6.41) and (6.42) together contradict the fact that B1 = (1 − δ)B(λ1) + δB2.
104 The Dynamics of Inequality
If strict inequality holds at date 0—B(λ0) > (1/δ)
¯
κ(λ0)— then we can arrive at a contradiction
simply under the weaker condition B(λ1) ≤ (1/δ)
¯
κ(λ1). For then λ1 , λ0 and therefore
(because λ1 ≥ λ0) it must be that λ1 > λ0. Therefore the weak inequality in (6.41) holds
strictly, and we obtain the same contradiction.
So the claim is established and we can apply Case III repeatedly to argue that λt+1 ≥ λt for
all t in this case.
Moreover, if B(λ0) > (1/δ)
¯
κ(λ0), then B(λt) > (1/δ)
¯
κ(λt) for all t subsequently, so convergence
cannot ever occur in finite time, in contrast to the “one-step” property of Case II.
Finally, observe that in the case B(λ0) > (1/δ)
¯
κ(λ0), in which λt+1 > λt for all t, there is no
t and no λ ∈ [λt
, λt+1] which is a steady state. For suppose there were; then in particular,
¯
κ(λ) ≥ B(λ), so that
(6.43)
¯
κ(λt) ≥
¯
κ(λ) ≥ B(λ) ≥ B(λt+1) > Bt+1,
where the very last inequality follows from the fact that λs < λs+1 for all s. But (7.42)
contradicts the equilibrium condition (6.26). This proves that in Case III, convergence
occurs to the smallest steady state to the right of λ0.
Proof of Observation 6.3. Let Wt denote the wealth of a typical member of generation t. We
claim that if Wt+1 < Wt
, Ws+1 ≤ Ws for all s > t. Suppose not; then there exist dates τ
and s with s > τ such that (a)Wτ+1 < Wτ, (b) Ws+1 > Ws
, and (c) Wm = Wτ+1 = Ws for all
intermediate dates τ+1 ≤ m ≤ s(this last requirement is, of course, vacuous in case s = τ+1).
But then a strictly higher wealth (Wτ compared to Ws) generates a strictly lower descendant
wealth (Wτ+1 compared to Ws+1), which contradicts a familiar “single-crossing” argument
based on the strict concavity of the utility function. Therefore dynastic wealth converges in
this case.
Next suppose that Wt+1 > Wt
. Then a reversal of the same logic implies that family wealth
is nondecreasing across generations.
Lemma 6.5. In the Becker-Tomes benchmark, W˜ − W has exactly the same sign (including equality)

Given (H), this reduces to the condition that

(W) is unchanging in W, so that [LP] is verified for all
but one value of r.
To prepare for the proofs of the remaining propositions, we record several lemmas, and we
presume (often implicitly) that [R], [E] and [LP] apply where needed.
Lemma 6.6. In the Becker-Tomes benchmark, for every w > 0 and r > −1:
(a) If w ≤ W < Ω(w,r), then W < W˜ (W; w,r) ≤ Ω(w,r). If W > Ω(w,r), then Ω(w,r) ≤
W˜ (W; w,r) < W.
(b) Ω(w,r) is nondecreasing in w.
(c) Ω(w,r) is continuous at every (w,r) at which it is finite.
Proof. Part (a) follows simply from the fact that W˜ (W; w,r) is nondecreasing in W. If, for
instance, W˜ (W; w,r) ≤ W < Ω(w,r), or if W˜ (W; w,r) > Ω(w,r) > W, limit wealth starting from
W can never equal Ω(w,r). This proves the first assertion in part (a); the second assertion
follows in similar fashion.
Part (b). We claim first that W˜ (W; w,r) is nondecreasing in w. To show this, it suffices to
assume that W˜ > w, but then it must be the case that
(6.46) U

W −
W˜ − w

(W˜ ).
Now suppose that w goes up to w
0
, but W˜ falls to W˜
0
. The new situation must therefore
have strictly positive consumption for the parent, so that the new first-order condition has
the opposite weak inequality:

W −

(W˜

But (6.46) and (6.47) together contradict the assumption that U and V are strictly concave.
With this claim in place, the result follows immediately from [LP].
Part (c). Suppose that Ω(w,r) is finite. By part (a), W˜ (W; w,r) (viewed as a function of W)
must “strictly intersect the 450
line” at the value Ω(w,r). The continuity of W˜ (W; w,r) now
assures us that Ω(w,r) must be locally continuous.
106 The Dynamics of Inequality
Lemma 6.7. For any steady state wage function:
(a) If h is inhabited, x(h) = x(h
0
) implies w(h) ≥ w(h
0
).
(b) If h is inhabited, then x(h) > x(h
0
) implies w(h) − w(h
0
) ≥ (1 + r)[x(h) − x(h
0
)].
Proof. If (a) is false and x(h) = x(h
0
) while w(h) < w(h
0
) then any parent selecting occupation
h for her child would do better to select occupation h
0
instead. The same is true if (b) were
false: the parent could switch to occupation h
0
for the child, combined with a higher financial
bequest so as to leave the child’s wealth unaffected, while increasing her own consumption.
As in the main text, it will often be convenient to write the wage as a function of training
cost: w(x). Part (a) of Lemma 6.7 informs us that we can certainly do this right away for
inhabited training costs.
Lemma 6.8. (a) The set of all inhabited training costs — call it T — is a subset of [0, X] of full
measure, and w is continuous on T.
(b) There is a unique continuous extension of w on T to all of [0, X], and it forms an equivalent
representation.
Proof. Part (a). Let T be the set of all inhabited training costs. Since a steady state must
have positive output by definition, it follows from [R] and [E] that T must be of full measure.
Moreover, w (viewed as a function of x) must be continuous on T. For if not, we can select
training costs x and x
0
in T that are arbitrarily close, but such that their wage difference is
bounded away from zero. In that case no parent would select the (almost identical) training
cost with a lower wage.
Part (b). Because w is nondecreasing on T and T is of full measure, there is a unique
continuous extension of w(x) to all of [0, X]. Use this extension to define wˆ(h) for all
occupations, inhabited or not. That is, wˆ(h) = w(h) if h is inhabited, and equals the continuous
extension otherwise. We first claim that wˆ(h) ≥ w(h) for all h that are uninhabited. For if not,
we have a contradiction in a manner similar to part (a): we can find an inhabited occupation
h
0 arbitrarily close to h but with wages bounded below that of w(h), which means that all
occupiers of h
0 would prefer h, a contradiction.24
By this claim, if we replace w by wˆ , no firm will wish to change its desired input mix (unused
inputs have not become any cheaper). To complete the proof of equivalence, observe that no
family occupying h
0 finds it strictly profitable to switch to an uninhabited occupation h once
its wage has been replaced by wˆ(h). For if this were true, then by the definition of continuous
extension we can find a third inhabited occupation h
00 with wage and training cost arbitrarily
close to that of h, such that the family must therefore also find it profitable to switch from h
0
to h
00. But this is a contradiction, since that option is already available in the going steady
state.
24This argument, as well as its counterpart for (a), can be made entirely precise by showing that the preference
for h over h
0
can be made uniform over all families, irrespective of their wealth.
The Dynamics of Inequality 107
In what follows we focus exclusively on this equivalent representation and call it w instead
of wˆ . Define w = w(0).
Lemma 6.9. Every family attains a wealth of at least Ω(w,r).
Proof. Let W be the steady state wealth of some family. Suppose that it incurs training
cost x and leaves bequest b; then by stationarity, W = (1 + r)b + w(x). Now, given the choice
of x, b must maximize
(6.48) U(W − x − b) + V(w(x) + (1 + r)b)
subject to b ≥ 0. Defining B ≡ b + x, this can equivalently be written as: B is chosen to
maximize
(6.49) U(W − B) + V(w
0 + (1 + r)B)
subject to B ≥ w(x), where w
0 ≡ w(x) − (1 + r)x. It is obvious that the solution to this problem
involves a total bequest B at least as large as the value that would obtain if the constraint
B ≥ w(x) were replaced by B ≥ 0, i.e., if we were in a Becker-Tomes benchmark world with w
0
and r. Remembering that W is also next period’s wealth in the problem (6.49), we conclude
that
(6.50) W ≥ W˜ (W; w
0
,r).
We now claim that
(6.51) W ≥ Ω(w
0
,r).
If this is false, then W < Ω(w
0
,r). Combining this with (6.50), we may conclude that
W˜ (W; w
0
,r) ≤ W < Ω(w
0
,r), but this contradicts part (a) of Lemma 6.6.
Now recall the definition of w
0 and invoke part (b) of Lemma 6.7 to conclude that w
0 ≥ w.
Use this fact and part (b) of Lemma 6.6 to observe that Ω(w
0
,r) ≥ Ω(w,r). Combine this last
inequality with (6.51) to obtain the desired result.
Lemma 6.10. Let W be any lower bound on stationary wealth across all families.
(a) If for any occupation h, we have w + (1 + r)x(h) ≤ W, then w(h) = w + (1 + r)x(h).
(b) The stationary wealth of any family selecting an occupation h with w + (1 + r)x(h) ≤ W must be
Ω(w,r).
Proof. Part (a). Suppose, on the contrary, that w + (1 + r)x(h) ≤ W, but w(h) , w + (1 + r)x(h).
By Lemma 6.7, part (b), and the fact that w is a continuous equivalent representation, it must
be that
w(h) > w + (1 + r)x(h).
so that for some x
0 < x(h) but close to it,
(6.52) w(x
0
) > w + (1 + r)x
0
.
Now, we know that there is a sequence of inhabited occupations {h
k
} such that x(h
k
) ↓ 0. By
assumption, W is a lower bound on stationary wealth across all families, and w + (1 + r)x
0 <
108 The Dynamics of Inequality
w + (1 + r)x(h) ≤ W. Therefore (for k large enough) such families are almost exclusively
leaving financial bequests of magnitude at least x
0
to their children at rate of return r. They
would be better off, instead, selecting an occupation with cost x
0
for their children (which
yields a return of strictly more than r, by (6.52), and supplementing the remainder with
financial bequests, a contradiction.
For each family selecting occupation h with w + (1 + r)x(h) ≤ W, we have w(h) = w + (1 +
r)x(h). Therefore the realized rate of return to all the choices of such a family, financial and
educational, is exactly r. Define xˆ by
(6.53) w + (1 + r)xˆ = W.
Once again, using Lemma 6.7, part (b), and the fact that w is a continuous equivalent
representation, we also know that wages for training costs beyond xˆ yield no less a return
than r for all educational investments beyond xˆ. Yet these families choose (by part (a)) not to
utilize such regions of educational investment. They must therefore be behaving in exactly
the same way as in a Becker-Tomes benchmark world with parameters (w,r). We must
conclude that their stationary wealth equals Ω(w,r).
Lemma 6.11. In an equal steady state, the common wealth of all families must be Ω(w,r), and
Ω(w,r) ≥ w + X(1 + r).
Proof. Let W denote the (common) wealth of each family in an equal steady state. We
claim that
(6.54) W ≥ w + (1 + r)X.
For if not, we know from Lemma 6.9, part (b) (and the fact that w is a continuous equivalent
representation) that there are inhabited occupations with training costs x arbitrarily close to
X, and that
w(x) ≥ w + (1 + r)x.
Consequently, if (6.54) were to be false, we would find inhabited occupations with w(h) > W.
Because the wealth of families in such occupations is at least w(h), this is a contradiction to
equality.
It remains to prove that W = Ω(w,r). Because (6.54) is true, and because W is (trivially)
a lower bound on stationary wealth, Lemma 6.10, part (b) applies to all families, and
W = Ω(w,r).
Lemma 6.12. A steady state is equal if and only if the continuous equivalent representation of the
wage function is linear:
(6.55) w(h) = w + (1 + r)x(h)
for all occupations h.
Proof. For necessity, combine Lemma 6.10, part (a), and Lemma 6.11. For sufficiency, note
that if (6.55) holds, then we are in a Becker-Tomes benchmark world and all limit wealths
must be the same.
The Dynamics of Inequality 109
The remaining steps concern unequal steady states. Define θ by
(6.56) w + (1 + r)θ = Ω(w,r).
Lemma 6.13. In an unequal steady state, it must be that θ < X.
Proof. By Lemma 6.9, Ω(w,r) is a lower bound on stationary wealth for all families. If,
contrary to our assertion, θ ≥ X, then part (a) of Lemma 6.10 applies for every training cost,
when W is replaced by Ω(w,r). Therefore w satisfies (6.55), and the sufficiency direction of
Lemma 6.12 implies that the steady state must be equal, a contradiction.
We are interested in the shape of w in the region U ≡ [θ, X].
Lemma 6.14. Let I be some subinterval of U such that no financial bequests are made by any family
that occupies some occupation with training cost in U. Then w satisfies (6.19) on I.
Proof. Fix any x ∈ I, with x < sup I. For  > 0 but small enough, x +  ∈ I as well.
Assume provisionally that both x and x +  are inhabited. Then family wealth at x (resp.
x + ) is merely w(x) (resp. w(x + )). Using the two optimality conditions, one for families
with wealth w(x) and the other for families with wealth w(x + ), we see that
(6.57) U(w(x)−x)−U(w(x)−(x+)) ≥ V(w(x+))−V(w(x)) ≥ U(w(x+)−x)−U(w(x+)−(x+)).
Now, using the fact that w is a continuous equivalent representation, and invoking [R] and
[E], we can see that (6.57) actually applies to all x and x +  in I, not just those that are
inhabited.25
Dividing these terms throughout by , applying the concavity of the utility function to the
two side terms, and the mean value theorem to the central term, we see that
U
0
(w(x) − (x + )) ≥ V
0
(γ())w(x + ) − w(x)

≥ U
0
(w(x + ) − x),
where γ() lies between w(x) and w(x + ). Now send  to zero and use the continuous
differentiability of U and V to conclude that the right-hand derivative of w with respect to x
— call it w
+(x) — exists, and
w
+
(x) = U
0
(w(x) − x)/V
0
(w(x)).
By exactly the same argument applied to x (greater than infI) and x − , we may conclude
the same of the left-hand derivative, which verifies (6.19).
Lemma 6.15. Any two-phase wage function has w0
(x) > 1 + r for almost all x > θ.
Proof. The continuous differentiability of U and V, and the continuity of w together
imply that w is continuously differentiable in its second phase, where it follows (6.19). Note
moreover that w
0
(θ) = 1 + r. Therefore, if the assertion is false, there is an interval [x1, x2],
with x1 ≥ θ, on which w
0
(x) ≤ 1+r, while w
0
(x1) = 1+r and w(x1)−(1+r)x1 ≥ 0.26 Applying
25Given [R] and [E], we can approach both x and x +  by a sequence of inhabited training cost pairs in I, and
for each such pair the inequality (6.57) holds.
26One way to assure the existence of an interval with all these properties is to take x1 to be the minimum of the
values among those greater than θ for which w
0
(x) ≤ 1 + r.
110 The Dynamics of Inequality
(6.19) at x1 and using w
0
(x1) = 1 + r, we see that
(6.58) U
0
(w(x1) − x1)) = (1 + r)V
0
(w(x1)).
Define wˆ = w(x1) − (1 + r)x1, which is nonnegative by construction. Then (6.58) reduces to
(6.59) U
0

rw(x1) + wˆ

!
= (1 + r)V

(w(x1)),
By the same logic as (6.58), except that at x2 we have w
0
(x2) ≤ 1 + r, we see that
(6.60) U
0
(w(x2) − x2)) ≤ (1 + r)V
0
(w(x2)).
Now observe that w(x1) + (1 + r)(x2 − x1) ≥ w(x2) (because w
0
(x) ≤ 1 + r on [x1, x2]), or
equivalently, using the definition of wˆ, x2 ≥
w(x2)−wˆ
1+r
. Consequently,
w(x2) − x2 ≤
rw(x2) + wˆ
1 + r
,
and using this in (6.60) along with the concavity of U, we must conclude that
(6.61) U
0

rw(x2) + wˆ

!
≤ (1 + r)V
0
(w(x2)).
Suppose that w(x1) > 0. Then (6.59) means that w(x1) is a positive limit wealth in the BeckerTomes
benchmark with (wˆ,r), while Lemma 6.5 tells us that W˜ (w(x2); wˆ,r) ≥ w(x2). Because
w(x2) > w(x1), this means that w(x1) cannot be a limit wealth starting from initial wealth
w(x2). This contradicts [LP].
On the other hand, if w(x1) = 0, then w = 0 and θ = 0 as well, which means that Ω(0,r) = 0:
the limit of Becker-Tomes wealth from all positive initial wealths is zero when w = 0.27 But
this fact is contradicted by Lemma 6.5 applied to (6.61), because wˆ is also 0 in this case.
If a wage function satisfies w(x) − w(x

) for all x and x
0
in some interval, say
that it is r-linear over that interval. We know, for instance, that any two-phase wage function
with a nondegenerate first phase indeed r-linear over [0, θ(w)].
Lemma 6.16. Suppose that a family in steady state, inhabiting training cost x at some date, also
makes a financial bequest at that date. That is, it possesses (and bequeaths) total wealth W, where
W > w(x). Then w is r-linear over all x0 ≥ x with w(x) + (1 + r)(x
0 − x) ≤ W:
(6.62) w(x
0
) = w(x) + (1 + r)(x
0 − x).
Proof. The proof is very similar to that of Lemma 6.10. Pick any x
0 with w(x)+(1+r)(x
0−
x) ≤ W. Our family is making a financial bequest of at least x
0 − x. If (6.62) were to fail, then
by Lemma 6.7, part (b), and the fact that w is a continuous equivalent representation, we
must have
w(x
0
) > w(x) + (1 + r)(x
0 − x),
which means that our family would certainly be better off choosing x
0
instead of x and
supplementing the remainder (if any) with financial bequests, a contradiction.
27Remember: this is a different statement from the one that asserts that 0 is a Becker-Tomes limit wealth when
w = 0, which is always trivially true.

Figure 6.7. Proof of Lemma 6.18
The next lemma summarizes what we know so far about an unequal steady state.
Lemma 6.17. The continuous equivalent-representation of any unequal steady state wage function
is r-linear up to θ, followed by combinations of intervals over which either the differential equation
(6.19) is obeyed, or r-linearity holds.
Proof. Combine Lemmas 6.14 and 6.16.
However, we now establish a stronger property:
Lemma 6.18. In an unequal steady state, the continuous, equivalent-representation wage function
must be two-phase.
Proof. Let w be a (continuous) steady state wage function, starting from w. Denote by
w∗
the two-phase wage function starting from the same point. We know already that the
two functions coincide at least up to θ. Suppose, contrary to the assertion, that w
∗
(x) , w(x)
for some x ∈ (θ, X]. Then there is some first r-linear segment “after” θ at which w departs
from w∗
.
By Lemma 6.15, w must lie below w∗
in this segment. Use Figure 6.7 as a guide in what
follows.
Pick some inhabited x in the interior of the r-linear segment; then pick x
0 ∈ (θ, x) such that
(6.63) w
∗
(x
0
) = w(x) > 0.
Pick any family that inhabits x at any date, and has stationary wealth W. The first-order

112 The Dynamics of Inequality
so that W > 0 is a limit wealth in the Becker-Tomes benchmark with baseline wage w
0 =
w(x) − (1 + r)x and rate of return r. By [LP] applied to this benchmark, a family with starting
wealth W0 = w(x) > 0 in this benchmark world must converge to the very same limit wealth.
Because W0 = w(x) ≤ W, convergence to W must require that W˜ (W0
; w
0
,r) ≥ W0
. Invoking
Lemma 6.5 and writing w(x) in place of W0
, we must conclude that
(1 + r)V
0
(w(x)) ≥ U
0
(
rw(x) + w

) = U

(w(x) − x).
Now recall the definition of x
0
from (6.63). Replacing w(x) by the same value w
∗
(x
0
), replacing
x by the smaller value x
0
, and using the strict concavity of U, we see that
(1 + r)V
0
(w

(w

but this contradicts the fact that w∗
satisfies (6.19) at x
0
.
Proof of Proposition 6.9. Lemma 6.8 establishes that there is a continuous equivalent
representation to the wage function in every steady state. Lemma 6.11 shows that in any
equal steady state, Ω(w,r) ≥ w + (1 + r)x, where w is the lowest wage in that steady state
wage function. Lemma 6.55 shows that the wage function must be r-linear for equal steady
states. Lemma 6.18 shows that unequal steady state wage functions must have the twophase
property: it is r-linear up to θ, which is defined in (6.56), and follows the differential
equation (6.19) thereafter. Lemma 6.15 shows that the second phase must exhibit a rate of
return that is almost everywhere higher than r.
Proof of Observation 6.5. The differential equation (6.19) in the exponential utility case reduces
to
(6.64) w
0
(x) =
1
δα exp(αx)
from which the stated result follows. Applying (6.19) to the constant elasticity case, we see
that for all x ≥ θ,

so that w
00(x) is continuous and has precisely the same sign as w(x)/x − w
0
(x). Notice that
w(x)
x
> w
0
(x)
at x = θ. So w
0
(x) increases just to the right of θ, while — using (6.65) — w(x)/x monotonically
falls. But it must be the case throughout that w(x)/x continues to exceed w
0
(x), otherwise the
very changes described in this paragraph cannot occur to begin with. Therefore w
0
(x) rises
throughout, establishing strict convexity to the right of θ.
The Dynamics of Inequality 113
However, w
0
cannot go to ∞, as another perusal of (6.65) will readily reveal. Indeed, w
0
converges to a finite limit, which is computed by setting both w
0
(x) and w(x)/x equal to the
same value in (6.65).
Proof of Proposition 6.10. The necessity of [P] is obvious, given the characterization in
Proposition 6.9, so we establish sufficiency.
Index each two-phase wage function w by its starting wage w, and define c
∗
(w) = c(r, w).
Condition P assures us that c
∗
(w1) ≤ 1 for some w1. We claim that c
∗
(w2) > 1 for some w2.
Suppose not; then c
∗
(w) ≤ 1 for all w. Send w ↑ ∞, then to maintain c
∗
(w) ≤ 1 it must be
that the associated cost-minimizing λ — call it λ(w) — converges weakly to 0. Fix any k > 0.
Then for w large enough, [E] implies that
f(k, λ(w))/k < r.
For all such w, concavity of f in k tells us that the associated cost-minimizing capital input
k(w) must be bounded. But now the continuity of f (together with [E]) atells us that output
goes to zero as w → ∞, which contradicts unit cost minimization. This proves the claim.
Because c
∗
is continuous,28 there exists w
∗ between w1 and w2 such that c
∗
(w
∗
) = 1.
We prove that the two-phase wage function w emanating from w
∗
satisfies all the conditions
for a steady state wage function. To this end, we specify a steady state wealth and bequest
distribution, and occupational choice.
First, let λ
∗ be the input mix associated with the supporting wage function w. Arrange the
population over occupations according to λ
∗
. Let θ = θ(w
∗
).
If a family i is assigned to occupation h with x(h) ≤ θ, set that family’s wealth equal to Ω(w
∗
,r),
its educational bequest equal to x(h), and its financial bequest equal to [Ω(w
∗
,r)−x(h)]/(1+r).
Otherwise, if occupational assignment h has x(h) > θ, set that family’s wealth equal to
w
∗
(x(h)), its educational bequest equal to x(h), and its financial bequest equal to 0.
To complete the proof, we must show that each family chooses an optimal bequest. First pick
a family located at occupation h with x = x(h) ≥ θ. Because w∗ has a slope of at least 1+r in x,
this family has no need to make financial bequests. Let M(x, x
0
) ≡ U(w(x) − x
0
) + V(w(x
0
)) be
this family’s expected payoff from leaving an educational bequest x
0
, and let N(x) ≡ M(x, x).
Then N is differentiable and it is easy to see that
(6.66) N
0
(x) ≥ U
0
(w(x) − x)w
0
(x) for all x, with equality if x ≥ θ.
28This is a consequence of the maximum theorem and the assumption that production is continuous in the weak
topology over occupational distributions on H.

ThereforeM(x, x) ≥ M(x, x

, so that the family at x behaves optimally by bequeathing
x.
Now consider a family located at x ∈ [0, θ]. We know that its total wealth equals Ω(w
∗
,r) =
w(θ) ≤ w(x) for all x ≥ θ, so by a standard single-crossing argument, and the observations of
the previous paragraph, that family will never bequeath more than θ. Therefore this family
must behave just as in a Becker-Tomes benchmark world with prices (w
∗
,r), so its assigned
bequest in optimal.
Proof of Proposition 6.11: Suppose, on the contrary, that there are two steady state wage
functions (modulo equivalent representations). Denote these by w1 and w2, and observe
from Proposition 6.9 that each of them must belong to the two-phase family. Let w1 and w2
be the two baseline wages, and let θi = θ(wi), for i = 1, 2. Without loss of generality suppose
that θ2 ≥ θ1.
These two wage functions must cross, otherwise if the profit-maximization (support)
condition is satisfied at one of them it will not be satisfied at the other. Beyond θ2 both
wage functions satisfy the same differential equation (6.19), which rules out a crossing in
this region. The functions also cannot cross below θ1 since both wage functions are r-linear
in this region. So θ1 < θ2, and the functions cross at some x¯ ∈ (θ1, θ2).
Now proceed as in the proof of Lemma 6.18. Pick some x in (x¯, θ2), inhabited under w2; then
pick x
0 ∈ (x¯, x) such that w1(x
0
) = w2(x) > 0.
By construction, Ω(w2,r) > w2(x) (x is on the r-linear segment of w2), and so W˜ (w2(x); w2,r) >
w2(x). By Lemma 6.5,
(1 + r)V
0
(w2(x)) > U
0
(w2(x) − x).
The Dynamics of Inequality 115
Using w1(x
0
) = w2(x), x
0 < x and the concavity of U, we must conclude that
(1 + r)V
0
(w1(x
0
)) > U
0
(w1(x
0
) − x
0
),
but this contradicts the fact that w1 satisfies (6.19) at x
0
.
Proof of Observation 6.6. Condition P tells us that for some two-phase wage function w,
c(r, w) ≤ 1. Define a new wage function wˆ that is r-linear from the same baseline wage as
that for w; then by Lemma 6.15, wˆ(x) ≤ w(x) for all x. It follows that c(r, wˆ ) ≤ 1 as well. The
existence of the required baseline wage a now follows from the same argument used in the
proof of Proposition 6.10.
Proof of Proposition 6.12. First assume that (6.21) fails; using the same technique as in the
proof of Proposition 6.10, it is easy to see that the r-linear wage function starting at a is an
equal steady state. Given Proposition 6.11, this completes the proof.
Indeed, by the characterization result of proposition 6.9, an equal steady state wage function
must be the wage function that starts at a. If, therefore, (6.21) holds, that proposition assures
us that an equal steady state cannot exist.
6.4.11 Informal Observations on Equilibrium Dynamics. [This section needs rewriting
to harmonize notation and cross-references with the material discussed earlier. What follows
has been extracted from Mookherjee and Ray (AER 2002).]
We now turn to the question of non-steady state dynamics. The basic ideas are simple,
though the details are complicated and thus suppressed below. A distribution of wealth
(past bequests plus current income) prevails at any date; this will map into a distribution
of wealth for the next generation. Of course, the analysis will be different depending on
whether condition (??) holds or fails, and in addition there are several different kinds of
initial conditions to consider. We report on a single case, but one that holds particular
interest. We assume that initial wealth is perfectly equally distributed, yet we suppose that a
steady state is incompatible with perfect equality; i.e. that (??) holds.
Begin, then, with a single wealth level which we shall call W0, commonly held by every
member of generation 0. The key to understanding the dynamics is the following simple
but powerful observation.
Observation 6.7. Suppose that next period’s wage function is given by w1, with lowest wage
¯
w1
. Let W1 ≡ Ψ(W0,
¯
w1
). Then for every x such that w1(x) ≤ W1, it must be the case that
w1(x) =
¯
w1 + (1 + r)x.
This follows from similar arguments made earlier: the rate of return on educational
investment must equal r over the entire range spanned by financial bequests for any given
occupation. Observation 6.7 has an interesting corollary.
Observation 6.8. For any N, there exists a threshold such that starting from any equal initial wealth
above this threshold, there is perfect equality for at least N generations.
To see this, recall the wage function w
∗
constructed earlier . For any N, define a threshold
— call it W˜ — such that if W0 ≥ W˜ , then Ψ(N)
(W0,
¯
w
∗
) ≥ w¯
∗
, where Ψ(N)
is the function Ψ

iterated N times. In words, we choose an initial wealth high enough so that N iterations
will not suffice to bring wealth down to w¯
∗
, in the pure bequest model with baseline wage
¯
w
∗
. If the wage function for the next N periods is given by w∗
, this is perfectly consistent
with equilibrium behavior for those N periods. All occupations are equally valuable, so
individuals are indifferent over these choices. Moreover, there will be full equality over this
epoch.
Observation 6.7 implies that this is the only possible outcome for the first N periods. Any
other candidate wage function would have to exhibit a return of r over occupations in
which the wage fell short of wealth. This implies right away that no other equilibrium
wage function can exist with the same starting wage
¯
w
∗
. Using Observation 6.7 again and
employing an argument similar to that used to establish uniqueness, we may also rule out
any candidate wage function with a different starting wage than
¯
w
∗
.
So perfect equality can prevail for a substantial number of periods. But — if (??) holds —
it cannot prevail forever. Because Ω(
¯
w
∗
) < w¯
∗
, there must eventually come a date T when
the recursion ψ
(T)
(W0,
¯
w
∗
) dips below w¯
∗
. At this stage, the symmetry of equilibrium is
broken and the economy must depart from the wage function w∗
. If not, all occupations
with wages that exceed ψ
(T)
(W0,
¯
w
∗
) would remain unoccupied. This cannot be: the wages
of such occupations must rise, yielding rates of return that exceed their counterpart on
financial bequests. For all other occupations, Observation 6.7 is applicable in full force, and
the occupational rate of return remains anchored to the financial rate.
Figure 6.8 describes the resulting “distortion” in the wage function. The diagram displays
N initial periods in which the wage function w∗ prevails, and there is no inequality. At date
N, wealth dips into the support of w∗
, and no occupation more expensive than xN can be

supported under the old rates of return. The economy must react by lowering the wages of
all occupations below xN, and by raising the rates of return to all other occupations. These
higher rates encourage the acquisition of such professions, and in so doing must generate
inequality. Of course, all generation-N individuals are still indifferent between the various
choices. But this is the last generation for which all payoffs are equal. The higher rates of
return on the more expensive occupations must inevitably result in inequality among the
next generation.
Once such inequality sets in, it will not go away. Familiar single-crossing arguments
guarantee that descendants of higher-wealth individuals must occupy the richer professions
and receive higher payoffs. The subsequent dynamics are complicated by the fact that the
wealth distribution is no longer degenerate. In the special case where there are just two
occupations (involving different training costs), it can be shown that the economy converges
to an unequal steady state, with inequality rising over time. Moreover, the rise in inequality
is augmented in the presence of financial bequests: it turns out that individuals in the
unskilled occupation at any date are less wealthy than their parents, and make smaller
financial bequests to their children than they received.
In the continuum case, the wealth distribution at any date must retain a mass point at its
lower bound, and it is this mass point which will be spread over all the “low” occupations,
which continue to bear the financial rate of return r. In the relatively “high” occupations, the
rate of return will continue its departure from r, attracting more individuals into this zone.
Figure 6.8 illustrates this with yet another iteration for date N +1. The new wage function is
given by the dashed curve. It must be linear (with slope 1 + r) up to the new threshold xN+1,
and then rises even more steeply than before, intersecting both the previous wage functions
from below. This rise induces some fresh symmetry-breaking, as new dynasties from the
“cheap” occupations seek the higher rates of return. If this process converges (a subject of
our current research), it must be to precisely the steady state we have described earlier. At
this steady state, there is a mass point of individuals with identical wealth, and among such
individuals there is a simple tradeoff between occupational choice and financial bequests,
among which they are indifferent. But there will also be a positive measure of individuals
arrayed over varying levels of wealth (and utility).

CHAPTER 7
Polarization and Conflict
As the struggle proceeds, the whole society breaks up more and more into
two hostile camps, two great, directly antagonistic classes: bourgeoisie
and proletariat. The classes polarize, so that they become internally more
homogeneous and more and more sharply distinguished from one another
in wealth and power. (Morton Deutsch, 1971)
7.1 Introduction
Conflict is a fundamental part of life in many developing countries. This section of the
course will try to set up models of conflict and also study its correlates.
Some basic facts: between 1945–1999, battle deaths in 25 interstate wars were approximately
3.33m. Compared to that, deaths in civil wars have totalled around 16.2m. Such wars have
been experienced in 73 states, with a median duration of six years. In 1999, there were 25
ongoing conflicts. It is reasonable to say that matters have only become worse in the twenty
first century.
These numbers are symptomatic of ongoing unrest, violence around the world. They
obviously have big effects for GDP and growth: one writer places the narrow economic
costs of conflict at around 8% of GDP.
By conflict we don’t just mean violent conflict. Demonstrations, strikes, processions: all of
these also cause a substantial amount of economic waste.
One sort of conflict may simply come from class antagonisms: the presence of rich and
poor subclasses in the population. This is classic redistributive conflict where redistribution
occurs, or is sought, from rich to poor. But it has also been argued that “ethnic divisions”
— broadly defined — may be a significant determinant of conflict. For instance, writers
such as Samuel Huntington (1996) have argued for a cultural perspective on conflict and
war. After all, there is no particular reason why redistribution must occur across economic
classes. It could happen between religious, ethnic, or spatially separated groups. Resources
are resources, no matter where they come from.
120 Polarization and Conflict
The monumental threatise on ethnic conflict is by Donald Horowitz (1985), who summarizes
thus:
“The Marxian concept of class as an inherited and determinative affiliation
finds no support in [the] data. Marx’s conception applies with far less
distortion to ethnic groups. Ethnic membership us generally given at birth,
. . . and have considerable power to generate conflict . . .
In much of Asia and Africa, it is only modest hyperbole to assert that
the Marxian prophecy has had an ethnic fulfillment.”
As I’ve said above, this doesn’t mean that ethnicity is necessarily a “primordial” or intrinsic
source of conflict. Ethnicity may simply be a relevant marker for carving out a larger
share of a smaller pie. Very often, ethnic groups are not particularly ranked by income:
Sinhalese/Tamils in Sri Lanka, Malays/Chinese in Malaysia, Hausa/Yoruba in Nigeria,
Serbs/Muslims in Bosnia, Dalits/low-income-Muslims in Gujarat, Basques/others in Spain.
In other situations, marked socio-economic differences do exist: Hutu/Tutsi in Rwanda
and Burundi, caste divisions in Bihar, Bengalis in pre-Bangladesh Pakistan, Muslims in the
Philippines, Kurds in Iraq, Sikhs in the Punjab, or the Naxalites in Eastern and SouthEastern
India.
Some interesting questions:
What sort of distributions make for conflict?
Distributions over what ? Ethnic groups or income classes? The answer would presumably
depend on what the salient marker is for conflict.
How might we decide whether unranked ethnicity or ranked class is salient in conflict?
7.2 What Creates Conflict?
7.2.1 Variables. Much (though not all) of the empirical literature on conflict throws in the
kitchen sink to see what washes up. On the left hand side goes in one of several alternative
dependent variables: many measures of “conflict”, ranging all the way from incidence of
demonstrations, procesions, or strikes, through riots and on to civil war.
Even with a specific choice such as civil war (used here) we need defining criteria (see SingerSmall
(1982), Licklider (1993), Doyle-Sambanis (2000), Fearon-Laitin (2003)). One important
distinction to be made is between onset and incidence. Did the conflict start in that year of
measurement, or was it ongoing? As we will see later this makes a big difference. Another
important question is the minimum number of deaths before a conflict is classifiable as such:
for civil wars, this is a matter of ongoing debate.
On the right hand-side goes in a slew of explanatory variables:
Economic: per-capita income, inequality of income or wealth, resource holdings . . .
Geographical: mountainous terrain, separation from capital city . . .
Polarization and Conflict 121
Political: “extent of democracy”, prior war . . .
And, of course
Ethnic: Measures of ethnolinguistic diversity drawn from the World Christian Encyclopedia,
Encyclopedia Britannica, Atlas NarodovMira, CIA FactBook. Measures of religious diversity
drawn from L’Etat des Religions dans le Monde, World Christian Encyclopedia, The
Statesman’s Yearbook.
This last information is typically put into an index of diversity. An index with particularly
wide currency is the ethnolinguistic fractionalization index, or ELF (of course, there’s nothing
to stop its use for religious diversity as well).
To define this, say there are M groups. nj
is the population share of group j. Then
E =
X
M
j=1
nj(1 − nj).
This has an obvious relationship to the Gini index of inequality if we take inter-group
distance to be equal to one.
ELF is widely used in empirical work (see Taylor and Hudson (1972), Mauro(1995), Easterly
and Levine (1997), Alesina et al. (2003), Vigdor (2002), Collier and Hoeffler (2002), Fearon
and Laiton (2003), and many others).
7.2.2 Some Findings. Perhaps the most robust finding in many different empirical studies
is that per-capita income is negatively related to conflict. A negative and significant
association is to be observed in the cross-sectional studies carried out by Collier and Hoeffler
(2002), Fearon and Laitin (2003), Montalvo and Reynal-Querol (2005) and several others. As
Fearon and Laitin (2003) summarize,
“Per capita income (measured as thousands of 1985 U.S. dollars and lagged
one year) is strongly significant in both a statistical and a substantive sense
. . . ”
It hardly needs mentioning that no causal inference can be drawn from such an association.
Relatively speaking, the best study that addresses this question is Miguel, Satyanath
and Sergenti (2004), which instruments for GDP growth shocks using rainfall. Such an
instrunment would be unacceptably weak in many of the richer developing countries, so
they restrict attention to a sample of 41 sub-Saharan African countries over the period
1981-1999. Their main results are best summarized in their own words:
“Using the comprehensive new database of conflicts developed by the
International Peace Research Institute of Oslo, Norway, and the University
of Uppsala, Sweden, we find that GDP growth is significantly negatively
related to the incidence of civil conflict in sub-Saharan Africa during the
period 1981–99 across a range of regression specifications, including some
with country fixed effects. The relationship between GDP growth and the
incidence of civil wars is extremely strong: a five-percentage-point drop
122 Polarization and Conflict
in annual economic growth increases the likelihood of a civil conflict (at
least 25 deaths per year) in the following year by over 12 percentage points
— which amounts to an increase of more than one-half in the likelihood
of civil war. Other variables that have gained prominence in the recent
literature — per capita GDP level, democracy, ethnic diversity, and oil
exporter status — do not display a similarly robust relationship with the
incidence of civil wars in sub-Saharan Africa. In the second main result,
we find — perhaps surprisingly — that the impact of income shocks on
civil conflict is not significantly different in richer, more democratic, more
ethnically diverse, or more mountainous African countries or in countries
with a range of different political institutional characteristics.”
To be sure, the exclusion restriction behind the use of rainfall as an instrument could be
violated if rainfall has some direct effect on conflict via some other pathway. For instance,
floods could destroy the road network and make it harder to contain government troops
— more conflict (though this is a bias that runs the other way from the instrumental
direction, which may actually strengthen the results). But of course, one could cook up
other connections, such as floods make it harder for government troops and rebels to engage
each other, which reduces conflict (in terms of deaths). The authors attempt to take care of
some of these effects in the paper.
What lies behind the connection behind poverty and conflict? What comes to mind most
immediately is the fact that poverty reduces the opportunity cost of conflict labor, making
it easier to use labor for some other activity. Of course, with poverty all around there may
not be much to appropriate, so this suggests that it might be more interesting to examine the
effects of (growth shocks)*inequality.
Some evidence that opportunity costs lie at the heart of the story comes from the paper
by Dube and Vargas (2007), which studies the effect of coffee and oil prices on conflict in
Colombia. Oil prices affect government revenues which are there to be grabbed, so one
would imagine that higher prices for oil positively affect conflict. In contrast, if coffeegrowing
is an economic activity that competes with resources given over to conflict (such
as labor!), then an increase in coffee prices would reduce conflict. Thus if the opportunity
cost story is right, one would expect that oil and coffee have opposite effects on conflict, and
indeed this is what Dube and Vargas find.
The opportunity cost argument is explicitly made by Collier and Hoeffler (1998), though
it is fairly obvious and appears implicitly in many papers. In contrast, Fearon and laitin
(2003) have argued that poverty is likely correlated with low government capabilities and
infrastructure that makes it harder to crack down on insurgencies. In support of this line
of reasoning they show that “mountainous terrain” is significant in “explaining” conflict,
showing thereby that infrastructure and geography matter. This line of argument requires
more investigation, however.
A second important finding is that the inequality of income appears to have at best an
ambiguous effect on conflict. Some early papers on this subject are Nagel (1974) for Vietnam,
Midlarski (1988) and Muller, Seligson and Fu (1989) (the last two are on land inequalities).
Specifically, under several measures of inequality such as the Gini, conflict appears to be
Polarization and Conflict 123
low both for low and for high values of inequality. This is a theme to which we will return
in more detail below.
As a related matter, we’ve already noted that measures of ethnic dispersion are closely
related to “inequality” — i.e., diversity — across ethnic groups. These, too, fail to matter.
The same findings appear and reappear in Collier and Hoeffler (1998, 2002), Fearon and
Laitin (2003), as well as Miguel et al (2004). Fearon and Laitin (2003) conclude thus:
“The estimates for the effect of ethnic and religious fractionalization are
substantively and statistically insignificant . . . The empirical pattern is thus
inconsistent with . . . the common expectation that ethnic diversity is a
major and direct cause of civil violence.”
This isn’t to say that ethnic or religious fractionalization cannot indirectly affect conflict. It
might, via reduced GDP (Alesina et al. (2003)), reduced GDP growth (Easterly and Levine
(1997)), or poor governance (Mauro (1995)). The claim really is that there is no direct effect.
An important theme that we pursue below is the development of a measure of “polarization”,
which we show is different from inequality. Is a Gini-like index like ELF a good measure?
Listen to Horowitz again:
“I have intimated at various points that a system with only two ethnic
parties . . . is especially conflict prone . . . In dispersed systems, group
loyalties are parochial, and ethnic conflict is localized; it ‘could put one
of a series of watertight compartments out of order, but it could not make
the ship of state sink . . . ’ The demands of one group can sometimes be
granted without injuring the interests of others . . . ”
On the other hand, continues Horowitz,
“A centrally focused system [with few groupings] possesses fewer cleavages
than a dispersed system, but those it possesses run through the whole
society and are of greater magnitude. When conflict occurs, the center has
little latitude to placate some groups without antagonizing others.”
The conflictual power of broad cleavages is of course an older theme: read the quotation at
the beginning of this chapter!
7.3 The Identity-Alienation Framework
Following Esteban and Ray (1991, 1994) and Duclos, Esteban and Ray (2004), I develop
below the identification-alienation framework. The idea is simple: polarization is related to
the alienation that individuals and groups feel from one another, but such alienation is fuelled
by notions of within-group identity. In concentrating on such phenomena, I do not mean to
suggest that instances in which a single isolated individual runs amok with a machine gun
are rare, or that they are unimportant in the larger scheme of things. It is just that these are
not the objects of our enquiry. We are interested in the correlates of organized, large-scale
social unrest — strikes, demonstrations, processions, widespread violence, and revolt or
124 Polarization and Conflict
rebellion. Such phenomena thrive on differences, to be sure. But they cannot exist without
notions of group identity either.
This brief discussion immediately suggests that inequality, inasmuch as it concerns itself with
interpersonal alienation, captures but one aspect of polarization. To be sure, there are some
obvious changes that would be branded as both inequality- and polarization-enhancing.
For instance, if two income groups are further separated by increasing economic distance,
inequality and polarization would presumably both increase. However, local equalizations
of income differences at two different ranges of the income distribution will most likely lead
to two better-defined groups — each with a clearer sense of itself and the other. In this case,
inequality will have come down but polarization may be on the rise.
Imagine, then, that society is divided into “groups” (economic, social, religious, spatial...)
Identity. There is “homogeneity” within each group.
Alienation. There is “heterogeneity” across groups.
The IA framework presumes that such a situation is inherently conflictual. In the words of
Esteban and Ray (1994),
“We begin with the obvious question: why are we interested in polarization?
It is our contention that the phenomenon of polarization is closely
linked to the generation of tensions, to the possibilities of articulated
rebellion and revolt, and to the existence of social unrest in general . . . At
the same time, measured inequality in such a society may be low.”
Does the standard theory of inequality measurement fit? Recall the
Pigou-Dalton Transfers Principle. A transfer of resources from a relatively poor to a relatively
rich individual must raise income inequality.
This principle forms the building block for all measures of inequality. But now look at this
example. Start here:
Polarization and Conflict 125
Income or Wealth
Density
and go here: Income or Wealth
Density
By all measures of inequality that are consistent with the Lorenz criterion (or equivalently,
second-order stochastic domination), inequality has come down. Yet there is something
disturbing about that: social tensions could be going up as two well-defined and distinct
groups begin to form. There could be situations here in which polarization is going up.
Of course, this isn’t to suggest that polarization — whatever it is — is always different from
inequality. If there is a “global compression” of the distribution, we would expect both
inequality and polarization to fall. See these diagrams. Start here:
126 Polarization and Conflict
Income or Wealth
Density
and go here: Income or Wealth
Density
But these two examples also tell us something else. It tells us that polarization may not be a
“local construct”. In both the examples, we have a compression taking place, yet they have
very different implications. A “local move” may have different effects depending on the
overall distribution. In contrast, inequality — as captured by the Pigou-Dalton principle —
is a local construct.
Observe, too, that the notion of “groups” may be quite general:
Economic: income- or wealth-based (class)
Social: religious, linguistic, geographical, political groupings.
Polarization and Conflict 127
But a natural notion of “distance” across economic groups makes income-based polarization
an easier starting point.
7.4 A Measure of Polarization
The task of this section is to develop axiomatically a measure of polarization. Our “inputs”
are various distributions of income or wealth on different populations (more precisely, density
functions with varying populations).
Our “output” is a measure of polarization for each distribution.
As we’ve tried to motivate earlier, each individual feels two things:
Identification with people of “similar” income.
[Use as proxy the height of density f(x) at income x.]
Alienation from people with “dissimilar” income.
[Income distance |y − x| of y from x.]
We therefore describe the effective antagonism of x towards y as a function T(i, a), where i is
the identification that a person at income x feels, and a is the income distance between x
and y. We suppose that T(0, a) = T(i, 0) = 0: both a sense of identification and alienation is
needed to fuel an effective sense of antagonism.
We view polarization as the “sum” of all such antagonisms over the population:
P(f) =
Z Z T

f(x), |x − y|

f(x)f(y)dxdy
This is not very useful as it stands. Way too much depends on the choice of the function T.
But hopefully it is a good starting point.
The axioms we use are based on densities that are unions of one or more basic densities. These
are symmetric, unimodal density functions f with compact support.
[By symmetry we mean that f(m − x) = f(m + x) for all x ∈ [0, 1], and by unimodality we
mean that f is nondecreasing on [0, m].]
A basic density (or indeed any density)
can be population-scaled: g(y) = p f(y).
can be income-scaled: g(y) = (1/µ)f(x/µ).
can undergo a slide to the right or left: g(y) = f(y − x), and
can be squeezed.
128 Polarization and Conflict
Take a closer look at this last one. Let f be any density and let λ lie in (0, 1]. A λ-squeeze of f
is a transformation f
λ
:
(7.1) f
λ
(x) ≡
1
λ
f

x − [1 − λ]m

.
Scalings, slides and squeezes partition the space of all densities. Each element of the partition
can be associated with a root, a basic density on [0, 2] with mean 1.
Axiom 1. If a distribution is just a single basic density, a “global compression” of that density
cannot increase polarization.
That is: global compression (the move described in the diagram below) cannot raise
polarization.
Income or Wealth
Axiom 2. If a symmetric distribution is composed of three disjoint scalings of the same basic
density, then a compression of the side densities cannot reduce polarization.
This is illustrated in the diagram below.
Income
Density
Axiom 3. Consider a symmetric distribution composed of four basic densities drawn from
the same root. Slide the two middle densities to the side as shown. Then polarization must
go up.
Polarization and Conflict 129
This is illustrated in the diagram below:
Income
Density
Our last axiom states that polarization rankings must be invariant to population scalings.
Axiom 4. [Population Neutrality.] Polarization comparisons are unchanged if both
populations are scaled up or down by the same percentage.
We can now state:
Theorem 7.1. A polarization measure satisfies Axioms 1–4 if and only if it is proportional to
(7.2) Z Z f(x)
1+α
f(y)|y − x|dydx,
where α lies between 0.25 and 1.
7.5 Proof of Theorem 7.1
Note: this section is technical (though illustrative), and should probably be omitted unless
you are comfortable with long and detailed arguments.
First, we show that axioms 1–4 imply (7.2). The lemma below follows from Jensen’s
inequality; proof omitted.
Lemma 7.1. Let g be a continuous real-valued function defined on IR such that for all x > 0 and all δ
with 0 < δ < x,
(7.3) g(x) ≥
1
2δ
Z x+δ
x−δ
g(y)dy.
Then g must be a concave function.
In what follows, remember that our measure only considers income differences across people,
so that we may slide any distribution to left or right as we please.
Lemma 7.2. The function T must be concave in a for every i > 0.
Proof. Fix x > 0, some i > 0, and δ ∈ (0, x). Consider three basic densities as in Axiom 2 but
specialize as shown in Figure 7.1; each is a transform of a uniform basic density. The bases

are centered at −x, 0 and x. The side densities are of width 2δ and height h, and the middle
density is of width 2 and height i. We shall vary  and h but to make sure that Axiom 2
applies, we choose  > 0 such that δ+ < x. A λ-squeeze of the side densities simply contracts
their base width to 2λδ, while the height is raised to h/λ. For each λ, decompose the measure
(??) into five components. (a) The “internal polarization” Pm of the middle rectangle. This
component doesn’t vary with λ so there will be no need to explicitly calculate it. (b) The
“internal polarization” Ps of each side rectangle. (c) Total effective antagonism, Ams felt by
inhabitants of the middle towards each side density. (d) Total effective antagonism Asm felt
by inhabitants of each side towards the middle. (e) Total effective antagonism Ass felt by
inhabitants of one side towards the other side. Each of these last four terms appear twice,
so that (writing everything as a function of λ),
(7.4) P(λ) = Pm + 2Ps(λ) + 2Ams(λ) + 2Asm(λ) + 2Ass(λ),
Now we compute the terms on the right hand side of (7.4). First,

The axiom requires that P(λ) ≥ P(1). Equivalently, we require that [P(λ) − P(1)]/2h ≥ 0 for
all h, which implies in particular that
(7.5) lim inf

P(λ) − P(1)

If we divide through by h in the individual components calculated above and then send h to
0, it is easy to see that the only term that remains is Ams. Formally, (7.5) and the calculations
above must jointly imply that

As (7.8) must hold for every x > 0 and every δ ∈ (0, x), we may invoke Lemma 7.1 to conclude
that T is concave in x for every i > 0.
Q.E.D.
Lemma 7.3. Let g be a concave, continuous function on IR+, with g(0) = 0. Suppose that for each a
and a0 with a > a
0 > 0, there exists ∆¯ > 0 such that
(7.9) g(a + ∆) − g(a) ≥ g(a
0
) − g(a
0 − ∆)
for all ∆ ∈ (0,∆¯ ). Then g must be linear.
The proof is straightforward and is omitted.
Lemma 7.4. There is a continuous function φ(i) such that T(i, a) = φ(i)a for all i and a.
Proof. Fix a and a
0 with a > a
0 > 0, and i > 0. Consider four basic densities as in Axiom
3 (see Figure ??) but specialize as shown in Figure 7.2; each is a transform of a uniform
basic density. The bases are centered at locations −y, −x, x and y, where x ≡ (a − a
0
)/2
and y ≡ (a + a
0
)/2. The “inner” densities are of width 2δ and height h, and the “outer”
densities are of width 2 and height i. We shall vary different parameters (particularly x) but
to ensure disjoint support we assume throughout that  < x and δ +  < y − x − ∆¯ for some
∆¯ > 0. Again, decompose the polarization measure (??) into several distinct components.
(a) The “internal polarization” of each rectangle j; call it Pj
, j = 1, 2, 3, 4. These components
are unchanged as we change x so there will be no need to calculate them explicitly. (b)

where we use the observations that x + y = a and y − x = a

Lemma 7.3 are satisfied, and T(i, .) must be linear for every i > 0 since T(0, a) = 0. That is,
there is a function φ(i) such that T(i, a) = φ(i)a for every i and a. Given that T is continuous
by assumption, the same must be true of φ.
Q.E.D.
Lemma 7.5. φ(i) must be of the form Kiα
, for constants (K, α)  0.
Proof. As a preliminary step, observe that
(7.10) φ(i) > 0 whenever i > 0.
otherwise Axiom 3 would fail for configurations constructed from rectangular basic densities
of equal height i. We first prove that φ satisfies the fundamental Cauchy equation
(7.11) φ(p)φ(p

for every (p, p

0 and define r ≡ pp0

that p ≥ r.
1 Consider a configuration with two basic densities, both of width 2, the first
centered at 0 and the second centered at 1. The heights are p and h (where h > 0 but soon to
be made arbitrarily small). A little computation shows that polarization in this case is given

If r ≥ p, simply permute p and r in the argument below.

Notice that as  ↓ 0, h() lies in some bounded set. We may therefore extract a convergent
subsequence with limit h
0 as  ↓ 0. By the continuity of φ, we may pass to the limit in (7.13)
and (7.14) to conclude that
(7.15) ph[φ(p) + φ(h)] = rh0
[φ(r) + φ(h

and
(7.16) λ

ph[φ(λp) + φ(λh)] = λ

Combining (7.15) and (7.16), we see that

φ(p) + φ(h)
φ(λp) + φ(λh)
=
φ(r) + φ(h
0
)
φ(λr) + φ(λh

.
Taking limits in (7.17) as h → 0 and noting that h
0 → 0 as a result (examine (7.15) to confirm
this), we have for all λ > 0,
(7.18)
φ(p)
φ(λp)
=
φ(r)
φ(λr)

Put λ = 1/p and recall that r = pp0
. Then (7.18) yields the required Cauchy equation (7.11).
To complete the proof, recall that φ is continuous and that (7.10) holds. The class of solutions
to (7.11) (that satisfy these additional qualifications) is completely described by φ(p) = Kpα
for constants (K, α)  0 (see, e.g., Aczel [1966, p. 41, Theorem 3]). ´
Lemmas 7.4 and 7.5 together establish “necessity”, though it still remains to establish the
bounds on α. We shall do so along with our proof of “sufficiency”, which we begin now.
Lemma 7.6. Let f be a basic density with mass p and mean µ on support [a, b]. Let m ≡ µ − a and

Lemma 7.10. Given that P(f) is of the form (7.20), Axiom 2 is satisfied if and only if α ≥ 0.25.
Proof. Consider a configuration as given in Axiom 2: a symmetric distribution made out of
three basic densities. By symmetry, the side densities must share the same root; call this f
∗
.
Let p denote their (common) population mass and m their (common) difference from their
means to their lower support. Likewise, denote the root of the middle density by g
∗
, by q its
population mass, and by n the difference between mean and lower support. As in the proof
of Lemma 7.2, we may decompose the polarization measure (7.20) into several components.
First, there are the “internal polarizations” of the middle density (Pm) and of the two side
densities (Ps). Next, there are various subtotals of effective antagonism felt by members
of one of the basic densities towards another basic density. Let Ams denote this when the
“origin” density is the middle and the “destination” density one of the sides. Likewise, Asm
is obtained by permuting origin and destination densities. Finally, denote by Ass the total
effective antagonism felt by inhabitants of one side towards the other side. Observe that
each of these last four terms appear twice, so that (writing everything as a function of λ),
overall polarization is given by
(7.29) P(λ) = Pm + 2Ps(λ) + 2Ams(λ) + 2Asm(λ) + 2Ass(λ).
Compute these terms. For brevity, define for any root h,
ψ1(h, α) ≡

(where it should be remembered that the distance between the means of the two side densities
is 2d). Observe from these calculations that Ams(λ) is entirely insensitive to λ. Consequently,

by construction; see (7.24) in the statement of Lemma 7.8. It follows from this expression that

shows that a situation in which q is arbitrarily close to zero (relative to p) is a necessary
and sufficient test case. By the same logic, one should make d/m as small as possible. The
disjoint-support hypothesis of Axiom 2 tells us that this lowest value is 1. So it will be
necessary and sufficient to show that for every root f

,
(7.31) λ
1−α + ψ(f

is nonincreasing in λ over (0, 1]. For any f

−(1+α)
must be nonnegative for every λ ∈ (0, 1]; the necessary and sufficient condition for this is
(7.32) α ≥

1 + ψ(f

.
Therefore, to find the necessary and sufficient bound on α (uniform over all roots), we need
to minimize ψ(f
∗
, α) by choice of f
∗
, subject to the condition that f
∗ be a root. By Lemma 7.8
, this minimum value is 3. Using this information in (7.32), we are done.
Lemma 7.11. Given that P(f) is of the form (7.20), Axiom 3 is satisfied.
Proof. Consider a symmetric distribution composed of four basic densities, as in the
statement of Axiom 3. Number the densities 1, 2, 3 and 4, in the same order displayed
in Figure 7.2. Let x denote the amount of the slide (experienced by the inner densities) in the
axiom. For each such x, let djk(x) denote the (absolute) difference between the means of basic
densities j and k. As we have done several times before, we may decompose the polarization
of this configuration into several components. First, there is the “internal polarization” of
each rectangle j; call it Pj
, j = 1, 2, 3, 4. [These will stay unchanged with x.] Next, there
is the total effective antagonism felt by inhabitants of each basic density towards another;
call this Ajk(x), where j is the “origin” density and k is the “destination” density. Thus total
polarization P(x), again written explicitly as a function of x, is given by
P(x) =
X
4
j=1
Pj +
X

so that, using symmetry,
(7.33) P(x) − P(0) = 2{[A12(x) + A13(x)] − [A12(0) + A13(0)]} + [A23(x) − A23(0)]
Now Lemma 7.7 tells us that for all i and j,
Aij(x) = kijdij(x),
140 Polarization and Conflict
where kij is a positive constant which is independent of distances across the two basic
densities, and in particular is independent of x. Using this information in (7.33), it is trivial
to see that
P(x) − P(0) = A23(x) − A23(0) = kijx > 0,
so that Axiom 3 is satisfied.
Given (7.20), Axiom 4 is trivial to verify. Therefore Lemmas 7.9, 7.10 and 7.11 complete the
proof of the theorem.
Q.E.D.
7.6 Polarization and Inequality
Our measurement of polarization is given by
Pol =
Z Z f(x)
1+α
f(y)|y − x|dydx,
where α lies between 0.25 and 1.
Compare with the Gini coefficient / fractionalization index:
Gini =
Z Z f(x)f(y)|y − x|dydx,
It’s the value of α that makes all the difference. The lower bound on α comes from Axiom 2,
which directly runs against inequality. Otherwise the other axioms are broadly in agreement
in inequality.
Note by the way that there also must be an upper bound on α. For if this were not the case,
identification effects will swamp alienation effects and global squeezes in the distribution
will increase polarization, which makes no sense. This is the job of Axiom 1.
7.7 Three New Properties
1. Bimodality. Polarization maximal for bimodal distributions, but defined of course over all
distributions.
2. Globality. The local merging of two “groups” raises polarization if there is a third “group”
of significant size, but lowers conflict in the absence of such a group.
3. Nonlinearity. Same direction of population or income movements may cause polarization
to go down or up, depending on context.

7.8 Other Remarks on the Measure
7.8.1 More on α. As we’ve discussed, there is a family of possible values of α, subject to the
lower and upper bounds of 0.25 and 1. We’ve already explained where these bounds come
from. The bounds can be narrowed further using additional axioms, though it is unclear
how compelling the additional steps are. Here is an example of the axiomatic approach:
Axiom 5. If p > q but p − q is small and so is r, a small shift of mass from r to q cannot reduce
polarization.
Diagrammatically, go from here:
Income
Density
r p q
to here:
Income
Density
Theorem 7.2. Under the additional Axiom 5, it must be that α = 1, so the unique polarization
measure that satisfies the five axioms is proportional to
Z Z f(x)
2
f(y)|y − x|dydx.
In a later section, we argue that there are strong behavioral reasons to focus on α = 2.
Polarization and Conflict 143
7.8.2 Scaling. Note that our main theorem states that polarization must be proportional to
a particular family of measures. There is therefore a scale factor here which can be employed
as we please. While this is not entirely precise, we can exploit this degree of freedom to
make the measure scale-free. Normalize the measure by µ
α−1
, where µ is mean income.
This procedure is equivalent to one in which all incomes are normalized by their mean.
Esteban and Ray (1994) begin, in contrast, by using the log of incomes and imposing axioms
on this variable.
7.8.3 Importance of the IA Structure.. Both the axioms and the IA structure needed to
pin down P.
It can be checked that several other candidates satisfy Axioms 1–4. These details are to be
included in future editions of the notes.
7.8.4 Partial Ordering. α varies between bounds, but can vary. So theorem gives us a
partial ordering. Ordinal description of this ordering is an open question.
7.8.5 Identification Windows.. “Identification” here is based on the point density. More
generally, individuals may possess a “window of identification”. Individuals within this
window would be considered “similar” — possibly with weights decreasing with the
distance — and would contribute to a sense of group identity.
At the same time, individuals would feel alienated only from those outside the window.
Thus, broadening one’s window of identification has two effects.
Can capture these two effects somewhat in our seemingly narrower model.
Suppose that each individual at x “perceives” an individual with income y to be at the point
(1 − t)x + ty. Thus the parameter t is inversely proportional to “breadth of identification”.
The “perceived density” of y from the vantage point of an individual located at x is then
1
t
f

y − (1 − t)x
t
!
It is easy to see that the polarization measure resulting from this extended notion of
identification is proportional to our measure by the factor t
1−α
.
It is also possible to directly base identification on the average density over a non-degenerate
window of width w. When we take w to zero, not only is P attained in the limit, but P is a
first-order approximation to P
w, in the sense that ∂P
w/∂w|w→0 = 0.
Nevertheless, the question of identification windows deserves more attention.
7.8.6 Comparing Distributions. Our characterization shows that a comparison across
distributions should depend on average alienation, average identification and on their joint
co-movement. We formalize this very quickly.
144 Polarization and Conflict
Let a(y) =
R
|y − x|dF(x), which is the alienation felt by y, and define average alienation a¯ by
a¯ =
Z
a(y)dF(y) =
Z Z |y − x|dF(x)dF(y).
Similarly, f(y)
α
is the identification felt by y, so define the average α-identification ι¯ by
ι¯α ≡
Z
f(y)
α
dF(y) =
Z
f(y)
1+α
dy.
Finally, let ρ be the normalized covariance between identification and alienation:
ρ ≡ covια,a/ι¯αa¯.
Then it is easy to verify that
Pα(f) = a¯ι¯α

1 + ρ

.
7.9 Social Polarization
Our polarization measure is easily applicable to ethnolinguistic or religious groupings.
Suppose that there are M “social groups”, based on region, kin, ethnicity, religion... Let
nj be the number of individuals in group j, with overall population normalized to one.
Let Fj describe the distribution of income in group j (with fj
the accompanying density),
unnormalized by group population. One may now entertain a variety of “social polarization
measures”.
7.9.1 Pure Social Polarization. Consider, first, the case of “pure social polarization”, in
which income plays no role. Assume that each person is “fully” identified with every other
member of his group. Likewise, the alienation function takes on values that are specific to
group pairs and have no reference to income. For each pair of groups j and k denote this
value by ∆jk. Then a natural transplant of (7.2) yields the measure
(7.34) Ps(F) =
X
M
j=1
X
M
k=1
n
1+α
j
nk∆jk.
Even this sort of specification may be too general in some interesting instances in which
individuals are interested only in the dichotomous perception Us/They. In particular, in these
instances, individuals are not interested in differentiating between the different opposing
groups. Perhaps the simplest instance of this is a pure contest (Esteban and Ray [1999]),
which yields the variant4
(7.35) P˜
s(F) =

(1 − nj).

See Reynal-Querol [2002] for a similar analysis. D’Ambrosio and Wolff [2001] also consider a measure of this
type but with income distances across groups explicitly considered.

given by

(1 − nj).
This is the measure used by Montalvo and Reynal-Querol, American Economic Review (2005),
a paper that we discuss in more detail below. It is instructive to recall the ELF, which is
given by
ELF =
X
M
j=1
nj(1 − nj),
and compare the two.
For instance, if all groups are of equal size, then polarization peaks when the number of
groups equals 2, and steadily declines thereafter. Fractionalization rises throughout.
As Montalvo and Reynal-Querol show, it matters empirically too . . .
Guatemala and Sierra Leone are examples of countries in which ethnic polarization is high
but ethnic fractionalization is low. Nigeria and Bosnia are examples of countries in which
religious polarization is high but religious fractionalization is low.
Once the two extremes — pure income polarization and pure social polarization — are
identified, we may easily consider several hybrids. As examples, consider the case in
which notions of identification are mediated not just by group membership but by income
similarities as well, while the antagonism equation remains untouched. Then we get what
146 Polarization and Conflict
one might call social polarization with income-mediated identification:
(7.36) Ps(F) =
X
M
j=1
(1 − nj)
Z
x
fj(x)
α
dFj(x).
One could expand (or contract) the importance of income further, while still staying away
from the extremes. For instance, suppose that — in addition to the income-mediation of
group identity — alienation is also income-mediated (for alienation, two individuals must
belong to different groups and have different incomes). Now groups have only a demarcating
role — they are necessary (but not sufficient) for identity, and they are necessary (but not
sufficient) for alienation. The resulting measure would look like this:

Note that we do not intend to suggest that other special cases or hybrids are not possible, or
that they are less important. The discussion here is only to show that social and economic
considerations can be profitably combined in the measurement of polarization. Indeed,
it is conceivable that such measures will perform better than the more commonly used
fragmentation measures in the analysis of social conflict. But a full exploration of this last
theme must await future research (though see the chapter on ethnic conflict below).
7.10 Empirics Revisited: Polarization, not Fragmentation?
We now discuss the recent results of Montalvo and Reynal-Querol (2005). They employ the
same basic specification as Fearon-Laitin (2003) and others, but this time with polarization
instead of fractionalization indices.
They study 138 countries over 1960–1995. The dependent variable is incidence of a civil
war over a five year period. They use what is known as the PRIO25 criterion for civil war,
at least 25 yearly deaths. (Refine this in later versions.) Their explanatory variables include
per-capita income, population size, terrain (proxy for ease of insurgency), primary exports
(proxy for payoff in event of victory), democracy indicators, and of course indices of ethnic
or religious polarization
First run a logit of civil war on ethnic fractionalization. Table 1 reports on the results.
Observe how fractionalization matters in the first column but loses significance completely
as variables such as per-capita income are included. This is the standard result that we had
described earlier.
Now for the logit using ethnic polarization. Table 2 reports. Ethnic polarization is not just
significant through all the variants; the effect is pretty big too. For instance, if polarization is
raised from 0.51 (the average) to 0.95 (Nigeria) the predicted probability of conflict doubles.
[An increase by one standard deviation (0.24) raises conflict probability by 50%.]
Now try the same logit with religious variables instead. Table 3 shows that just like
ethnic fractionalization, religious fractionalization starts out significant but matters quickly
degenerate when additional controls are thrown in. This finding is to be contrasted with

what happens when a religious polarization variable is employed (Table 4). Religious
polarization stays significant through the various specifications, just as ethnic polarization
did.
These observations are robust to several different specifications. Ethnic polarization is
significant when entered into same regression with ethnic fractionalization; the latter is not.
The same is true if a measure of ethnic dominance (Collier (2001) and Collier and Hoeffler
(2002)) is used instead. Both these observations are still true if “ethnic” is replaced by
“religious”.
The analysis is also robust to the use of different datasets. The World Christian Encyclopedia
is used here to construct ethnic polarization indices. Alternatively, the Encyclopedia
Britannica or the Atlas Nadorov Mira could be used. My main worry here is that I am not
sure how the authors have constructed their ethnic groupings. Clearly they ahev aggregated
some of the highly disaggregated information. But what if they’ve done so in some way
that’s endogenous?
The results are also robust to “joint indices” of ethnic and religious polarization.[Measure
along each dimension, pick the max.] Finally, it appears to be robust to alternative definitions
of civil war.

7.11 Next Steps
Let’s return to the old question: is ethnicity primordial or instrumental as a determinant of
conflict?
An economist’s instincts suggests that these things are essentiall;y instrumental but I suppose
one never knows . . .
Recall that the findings on per-capita income certainly support an instrumentalist position
on civil war. That suggests a test for ethnic instrumentality: see if economic differences
across groups predicts conflict. But there is an important and fundamental reason why such
a test may be problematic.
Two kinds of economic conflict: “vertical” versus “horizontal”
The “vertical war” certainly exists but is harder to spot and infrequently delineated by
ethnicity. Caste is a good counterexample. With ethnicity and religion, the conflict is
often horizontal: attacks on competing businesses, reduction of labor supply, reallocation of
specific public goods. Listen to Horowitz again:
“In study after study, it has been assumed that ethnic relations are necessary
relations between superiors and subordinates . . . In fact, many ethnic
groups are enmeshed in a system of subordination. But the relations of

many other ethnic groups — on a global scale, most ethnic groups — are
not accurately defined as superior-subordinate relations . . .
Unlike ranked groups, which form part of a single society, unranked
groups constitute incipient whole societies. It is not so much the politics of
subordination that concerns them, but rather the politics of inclusion and
exclusion.”
How then to augment our polarization measure for wealth differences across and within
groups? The answer may depend on the observer’s feel for the sort of conflict that is relevant.
If conflict is “vertical”, income differences across groups are conducive to conflict, and so is
income homogeneity within groups
On the other hand, if conflict is “horizontal”, income or occupational similarities across
groups may drive conflict and so might income inequality within groups (the buying of
“conflict labor”, as with Dalits in the Gujarat carnage). I will come back to these matters
later.
The interaction of economics and ethnicity creates new conceptual challenges for the
measurement of polarization.

7.12 Summary So Far
1. Several authors, notably Samuel Huntington, have argued for cultural explanations of
economic development (or lack thereof).
2. Extending this line of thinking, authors such as Donald Horowitz have suggested links
between conflict and ethnic differences.
3. But statistical studies that employ a well-known measure of ethnic and religious
fragmentation show no links with conflict. [Though there are links with economic growth.]
4. In this chapter, I argue for the use of a measure very different from fragmentation — a
polarization index.
5. The measure has a philosophical foundation — the identity-alienation framework — which
may turn out to be useful in other applications.
6. I then discuss an empirical study which uses this polarization measure to exhibit a robust
and positive relationship between (ethnic or religious) polarization and the incidence of
conflict.
7. This does not mean that we buy Huntington on the primordial nature of cultural
differences. An economic war may still be waged behind the ethnic veil.
Polarization and Conflict 151
7.13 A Behavioral Approach to Polarization
No measurement theory can do justice to the claim that there is indeed a link between
polarization and conflict.
Two potential links:
(1) Empirical: fit the measures to the data and see they are related to measured indicators
of social conflict.
(2) Theoretical: write down a “natural” theory of conflict in which the level of
equilibrium conflict is related to distributional polarization.
Here, we concentrate on the latter (with an eye on the former, of course).

Then R (squared) is the unique real eigenvalue of this matrix.

Remark. Observe the squaring of the population coefficients. This is related to polarization
in a way that we will explain later.
7.19 Connections with Polarization
Several connections between behavioral model and the axiomatic approach:
1. Bimodality. Both conflict and measured polarization are maximal for symmetric bimodal
distributions.
154 Polarization and Conflict
2. Globality. The local clustering of two groups raises conflict if there is a third group of
significant size, but lowers conflict in the absence of a third group. Same true of polarization.
3. Nonmonotonicity. Start with a uniform distribution of population across G groups, where
G ≥ 4. Transfer population mass from one of the groups to the others, until a uniform
distribution over G − 1 groups is obtained. Then conflict — and polarization — are higher
at the “end” of this process, but may go down in the “intermediate” stages.

7.21 Four Research Questions
A. Group Formation and Interaction.
In many situations, groups are effectively given — men and women, Hindus and Muslims,
importers and exporters ...
In others, there is a wider dispersion of preferences and (sharp) groups arise as a result of
explicit membership decisions — political parties, trade unions, environmental coalitions.
Polarization and Conflict 155
Can be modeled as a two-stage game. For theory, see Bloch [1996, 1997], Ray and Vohra
[1997, 1999, 2001], Konishi and Ray [2003], Yi [1997] ...
[1] In “stage 1”, individuals, possibly endowed with widely varying characteristics, form
groups. (They take “similar” actions, form coalitions or clubs, write binding agreements...)
[2] In “stage 2”, groups “interact” in the way described earlier.
For some recent attempts for “conflict games” see Bloch and Sanchez (2003), Esteban and
Sakovicz (2003), Tan and Wang (2000). ´
B. Group Salience.
Return to the case of given groups. Many intersecting dimensions: what determines which
group classification is salient?
To some extent, the answer must depend on the set of available policies.
One might say that a society is polarized if the average resistance over a set of policies is high.
Can apply this notion quite easily once we fix a space of policies and a measure over that
space.
E.g., look at a very simple policy x, for which the winners are to one side of the income level
x and the losers are on the other.
x
Winners Losers
Resistance to policy = 1 - F(x)
If we equate polarization to average resistance over a distribution G of policies, we get:
P =
R
min{F(x), 1 − F(x)}dG(x).
Might argue that G is uniform or even equal to F. Still begs the question: what determines
the space of policies?
C. Effort and Money.
Behavioral model looks pleasantly general, but in fact the explicit introduction of income
(or wealth) poses new challenges.
156 Polarization and Conflict
How are resources expended in the lobbying process?
[In a “perfect” democracy where all questions are solved by referenda, this problem becomes
irrelevant.]
The poor use effort; the rich use money.
The political system determines a political exchange rate between effort and money.
Individual characteristics (abilities, access, wealth) determine an economic exchange rate
between effort and money.
The cutoff for different types of participation (effort vs. money) will depend on the political
system.
The structural features of such a model will impose useful restrictions on empirical analysis.
Typically, instances of open conflict will be observable while the use of money to influence
policies will not be.
Suggests the use of modified polarization measures in which the symmetry between different
groups is broken if there are wealth differences.
D. Lobbies as Signals.
Based on Esteban and Ray (2006).
[1] Governments play a role in the allocation of resources.
[2] Governments lack information — just as private agents do — regarding which sectors
are worth pushing in the interests of economic efficiency.
[3] Agents (sectoral interests, industrial confederations, R&D coalitions ...) lobby the
government for preferential treatment.
[4] A government — even if it honestly seeks to maximize economic efficiency — may be
confounded by the possibility that both high wealth and true economic desirability create
loud lobbies.
Connects inequality and lobbying to resource allocation.
7.22 Summary
I have discussed two approaches to study of polarization and conflict.
The axiomatic approach delivers a new set of measures which may be useful in empirical
work.
Polarization and Conflict 157
The behavioral approach complements the axiomatic approach by explicitly laying down a
model of conflict.
While the axiomatic approach is possibly of greater empirical relevance, the behavioral
approach cannot be dispensed with as a conceptual check on the axioms.
In particular, issues of group formation, group salience, the use of alternative forms of
resources in a conflictual process, and role of lobbying as a signaling device can be usefully
analyzed under the behavioral approach.
7.23 Other Issues in the Theory of Conflict
7.23.1 Public Versus Private Goods. So far we have assumed that conflict takes place
over the allocation of public goods. One might also be interested in situations in which the
good to be allocated is private or partly private. For simplicity, suppose that there are only
two groups, with population sizes n1 and n2 summing to one. We also suppose that the cost
function is isoelastic, c(r) = (1/α)r
α
for α ≥ 2 (thus satisfying our third-derivative condition).
There is a budget of G which is up for grabs. Assume that a fraction λ of this is public, while
the remaining fraction is private and divided equally among the winning group. Group i
then chooses ri

and it is very easy to now see that this expression is maximized at the symmetric bipolar
distribution in which ni = nj = 1/2. Thus in the quadratic case the degree to which the
prize is public or private matters not at all in determining which distribution is the most
conflictual.

When α , 2 an extended version of (7.43) holds, which we now derive. Use equation (7.42)

and this is the appropriate extension of (7.43), which was derived for α = 2 (in fact, just put

It can be shown that for α > 2, this function is maximized at ni = nj = 1/2.5 Details relegated
to Digression below.
Digression. Do you really want to read this? Well, carry on if you must. We are going to show that
the last line in (7.46) is maxed at ni = nj = 1/2. There are three terms in this last line, each raised to
different powers. It is very easy to verify that the first and second of these, P(ni)niP(nj)nj and ninj
,
are each maximized when ni = nj = 1/2. The third term (which is raised to the power α − 2) takes a
bit more work. It will suffice to show that the expression

We’ve therefore shown that the bipolarization result is quite robust when it comes to
explaining the intensity of conflict, conditional on it happening in the first place. Whether
the good to be fought over is public or private really does not matter too much.
7.23.2 Conflict Initiation. The italicized phrase in the last paragraph is important, however.
Highly polarized situations may not exhibit any conflict to begin with, because
everyone knows that the conflict is going to be very costly if it happens. Therefore, a little
bit more attention has to be paid to theories that attempt to relate conflict to polarization.
Let us explore these matters a bit further as they have interesting implications for the identity
of the initiating party. Suppose again that there are two groups, and that group i receives
a peacetime payoff in which it obtains a share si of the good. Then it is easy to see that its
peacetime payoff is simply given by siP(ni), where we define P(n) =
h
λG + (1 − λ)
G
n
i
as in
the previous section. It follows that group i will want to engage in conflict provided that
(7.47) P(ni)
niri
R
− c(ri) > siP(ni),
where ri and R are to be interpreted as equilibrium values in the ensuing conflict.
Once again adopt the isoelastic specification and recall the first-order condition (7.40) with
respect to ri
. But write it in a form that we used for our conflict and distribution study:
(7.48) P(ni)pipj = r
α
i
,
where pi (and likewise pj) is just the win probability or conflict share niri/R. We may use
this to obtain a quasi-closed-form for the net payoff from conflict:
(7.49) P(n)pi − c(ri) = P(ni)

pi −
1
α
pi(1 − pi)

.
Now we proceed to an analysis of conflict initiation. Consider the equivalent formulation
of the first-order condition for group i (which essentially reproduces (7.40)):
(7.50) P(ni)ninj = R
2
r
α−1
i
rj
.
160 Polarization and Conflict
If the good in question is purely public, then we may simply normalize P(n) = 1, so that
ninj = R
2
r
α−1
i
rj
.
Of course, exactly the same condition applies to rj
, and it therefore follows that ri = rj = R,
and so pi = ni
. Using this information in (7.49) above and invoking (7.47), we obtain the
following condition for conflict initiation:
ni −
1
α
ni(1 − ni) > si
.
It is easy to see that the left-hand side of this expression is strictly increasing in ni
,
6
, and that
it must therefore cross the right-hand side from below (provided si
lies strictly between 0
and 1). We conclude then that large groups initiate conflict when the battle is over public
goods.
Place si at 1/2 for symmetry. Observe that the condition never holds when ni = 1/2. This
is the most polarized case but it does not exhibit conflict. On the other hand, once conflict
breaks out it is monotonically related to polarization, as discussed in the previous section.
So equilibrium conflict jumps up at the threshold and then declines again monotonically to
zero as ni → 1.
An interesting point to note is that ni >
√
s is always sufficient for conflict (simply make
the LHS as small as possible in α by putting α = 1). This is a more general point that
is independent of the cost function.7
In any case the important point is that large groups
initiate in the public goods case.
This observation is, however, reversed when the good at stake is private. To see this, recall
the first-order condition for group i, (7.50), and normalize P(n) = 1/n to see that
nj = R
2
r
α−1
i
rj
.
Dividing by the corresponding first-order condition for group j, we may conclude that
ri
rj
=
nj
ni
1/α
,
which captures part of the Olson intuition that small groups lobby more per-capita.8
Therefore the probability that i wins the conflict is given by
(7.51) pi ≡
niri
niri + njrj
=
n
(α−1)/α
i
n
(α−1)/α
i
+ n
(α−1)/α
j
,
6The reason is that the derivative of n(1 − n) never exceeds 1.
7To prove this, note that the more general first-order condition is just ninj = R
2
c
0
(ri)/rj for both i and j, so it is
still true that ri = rj = R. It follows that c
0
(R)R = ninj
. Now recall the conflict initiation condition (7.47), and note
that by convexity c
0
(R)R ≤ c(R). Therefore a sufficient condition for (7.47) to hold is that ni − ninj > si
, which
proves the claim.
8This is, however, far from a full examination of the Olson paradox as we also have to allow for free-riding
within the group. For a model that does this, see Esteban and Ray (APSR 2001).
Polarization and Conflict 161
so in particular large groups still have a higher win probability.
Finally, invoke (7.49) and (7.47) to write down the condition for conflict initiation in the
private goods case, which is

pi −
1
α
pi(1 − pi)

> si
,
where pi
is now given by (7.51).
In contrast to si = 1/2, the symmetric case for peacetime is now si = ni
. Let us use this
benchmark to understand conflict initiation. Rewriting the condition above with si = ni
, we
obtain
(7.52) 1
α
p
2
i
+
α − 1
α
pi > ni
.
Combine this inequality and (7.51) to now establish the following observation. There is a
unique population threshold below which a group will initiate conflict.
To prove this claim, recall (7.51) and take a closer look at p (dropping subscripts):
p(n) =
n
k
n
k + (1 − n)
k
,
where k ≡ (α − 1)/α. The function p has an interesting “reverse-logistic” shape. It starts
above the 450
line and at the point n = 1/2 crosses it and dips below. The derivatives at the
two ends are infinite. To check these claims, note that
n
k
n
k + (1 − n)
k
≥ n
if and only if n ≤ 1/2 (simply cross-multiply and verify this), and that
p

(n) =
knk−1
(1 − n)
k−1
[n
k + (1 − n)
k
]
2
,
which is infinite both at n = 0 and n = 1. Now recall (7.52) and write it as
(1 − k)p(n)
2 + kp(n) > n.
By the arguments just made on derivatives, the LHS starts out higher than the RHS and ends
up lower than the RHS. This means that conflict is preferable for small minorities and not so
for large majorities, in contrast already to the results for public goods.
Indeed, we can strengthen that last argument to show that
(1 − k)p(n)
2 + kp(n) < n
for any n ≥ 1/2, that conflict becomes strictly bad for any weak (nonunanimous) majority.
Suppose this is false for some 1 > n ≥ 1/2. By the properties of p already established, we
know that n ≥ 1/2 implies n ≥ p(n), so that
(1 − k)n
2 + kn ≥ n,
but this can never happen when n < 1, a contradiction. So conflict can never be preferable
for a weak majority of the population.
162 Polarization and Conflict
It remains finally to show that there is a unique intersection (crossing from above to below)
in the interior. Let n
∗ ∈ (0, 1) be an interior solution; then
(1 − k)p(n
∗
)
2 + kp(n

.
Differentiate to show that the crossing is “from above”.
CHAPTER 8
Inequality and Incentives
In this chapter we study collective action problems (such as team production or the voluntary
provision of public goods) and identify three channels through which inequality affects
incentives and therefore overall efficiency.
The general structure of a team production problem is as follows. There is a group of n
agents, each of whom contributes resources (money, effort) ri
. The joint output is given by
(8.1) Y = F(r)
where r = (r1, . . . ,rn) is a (nonnegative) vector.
Depending on the application, Y could be a public good or a private good.
I now introduce the three channels through which inequality might function:
A. Wealth. Suppose that the team good is public, and that person i has wealth endowment
wi
. The person i’s payoff may be written as
Y + u(yi − ri).
The question then is: how does inequality in wealth affect incentives?
B. Access. Suppose that all agents are identical in endowment, and the good is private. But
it is unequally distributed. Then different individuals have different shares of Y.
In this example, our proxy for inequality is a vector of shares ` ≡ (λ1, λ2, λn), which sum to
unity. For instance, this may be a problem of joint maintenance of an irrigation network, or
of cooperative farming, in which case the shares would proxy the amount of land holdings
of the agent.
How might inequality in access affect incentives?
C. Inequality Tolerance. Attitudes to inequality might affect incentives in situations where
commitment is not possible. To illustrate this problem suppose that there are two regions
A and B which receive funding from an equality-minded central government. Suppose that
region i invests ri and produces yi = f(ri) (think of yi as regional tax revenues and ri as
resources put into the generation of local revenues).
164 Inequality and Incentives
Suppose that the center must choose transfers ti
to each of the regions, satisfying some
budget constraint tA + tB = T. Suppose that it has welfare function
W(yA + tA) + W(yB + tB).
If the center can commit to the transfers then in a symmetric optimum it would set ti = T/2
and then each region i would choose ri
to
max ti + f(ri) − ri
;
this would implement the first-best without a problem. However, if the center does not
commit to the transfers then the states move first and choose yi
. This creates a dilemma if
the center then picks tA and tB to
max W(yA + tA) + W(yB + tB),
with yA and yB given. Ignoring corner solutions, we see that this would entail
yA + tA = yB + tB.
This creates a disincentive problem for the regions. Each region i will anticipate this
compensatory behavior by the center and so choose ti
to maximize
yi + ri(yA, yB).
It is easy to see that this leads to the first-order condition
1
2
f
0
(ri) = 1,
which implies substantial underinvestment relative to the first best.
Clearly, much of this depends on how the center reacts to the choices of yA and yB, which in
turn depends on the degree of egalitarianism felt by the center, which is embodied in W. It
also depends on whether the center plans to “compensate” the regions for their investment
of r. This leads to the general class of questions:
When a principal cannot commit to a reward function, how does her tolerance for inter-agent
inequality affect the incentives of participating agents?
8.1 Inequality in Endowments
I build on a classic paper on the voluntary provision of public goods by Bergstrom, Blume
and Varian (1981). There are n agents, each of whom contributes resources ri
to a public
good. Output is given by
(8.2) G = f(r),
where r =
P
i
ri
, and f is smooth, increasing and concave. (One can take a more general
specification but this will do to illustrate our main points.)
The individual utility function is
u(ci) + G,
where ci = wi − ri for all i, and u is smooth, increasing and strictly concave.
Inequality and Incentives 165
An equilibrium is a vector r
∗
such that every individual i choose r
∗
i
optimally, given that
resources contributed by the others is r
∗
j
for j , i.
Proposition 8.1. There exists a unique equilibrium.
Proof. Suppose, on the contrary, that two distinct vectors r and r
0 are both equilibria.
Without loss of generality r
0 ≥ r. Pick i such that r
0
i
> ri
. Because r
0
i
> 0, we must have
(8.3) u

(wi − r
0
i
) = f
0
(r
0
),
while
(8.4) u
0
(wi − ri) ≥ f
0
(r).
Because r
0
i
> ri
, we have that u
0
(wi − r
0
i
) > u
0
(wi − ri). Using this in (8.3) and (8.4), we must
conclude that
f
0
(r

) = u
0
(wi − r
0
i
) > u
0
(wi − ri) ≥ f
0
(r),
so that by the concavity of f, r
0 < r. This is a contradiction.
Our next proposition describes an interesting fact about the Bergstrom-Blume-Varian model,
which is that — to the extent that contributions are interior — it is a distribution-neutral
theory.
Proposition 8.2. Suppose that under a wealth distribution w every individual makes strictly positive
contributions. Consider another wealth distribution w0
, with the same aggregate wealth, such that
no individual’s wealth is reduced by more than her contribution under w. Then r = r
0
: overall
contributions are unaffected.
Proof. Define i ≡ w
0
i
− wi for every i, and then define r
0
i
≡ ri + i
. Because P
i
i = 0, we have
r
0 = r. Also, r
0
i
≥ 0 for all i because ri ≥ −i
, by assumption. Now recall that
u
0
(wi − ri) = f
0
(r)
for all i, because ri > 0, so we must conclude that
u
0
(w
0
i
− r
0
i
) = f
0
(r
0
)
as well. This means that r
0
is an equilibrium under the new wealth distribution, and by
Proposition 8.1, it is the only one.
Proposition 8.3. In any equilibrium, everyone who makes positive contributions has their
consumptions and utilities fully equalized, regardless of their wealth.
Proof. For ri and rj both positive, we must have
u
0
(wi − ri) = u
0
(wj − rj) = f
0
(r),
so that ci = cj and ui = uj
.
This is a strange result, and it cannot be broken even with very general utility functions such
as u(c, G). It does break down if f is asymmetric across agents or if the utility function is
heterogeneous across agents.
166 Inequality and Incentives
This motivates a careful study of corner solutions in the voluntary contributions model.
These solutions are not at all exceptional: it is quite reasonable to suppose that some poor
agents do not make contributions, while the richer agents do. So let w be some wealth
distribution. Let I be the set of all agents who make positive contributions: I = {i|ri > 0}.
Observe that small redistributions of wealth within I have no effect on aggregate outcomes,
just as in the neutrality proposition studied earlier.
What about a redistribution from j < I to some i ∈ I?
Proposition 8.4. Greater inequality in wealth either leaves aggregate contributions unchanged, or
pushes them towards higher levels.
Proof. To prove this, it suffices to consider a small transfer  from j < I to i ∈ I, such that
the set I remains unchanged. (This follows from Proposition 8.2 on distribution-neutrality.)
I claim that in the new equilibrium, r
0 > r. Suppose not; then r
0 ≤ r. Now
u
0
(wk − r
0
k
) = f
0
(r
0
)
for k ∈ I, k , i. Because f
0
(r
0
) ≥ f
0
(r), we must conclude that r
0
k
≥ rk
for all such k. For i, we
have that
u
0
(wi − r
0
i
) = u(wi +  − r
0
i
) = f
0
(r
0
)
so by the same argument, r
0
i
−  ≥ ri
. Putting all this together, we must conclude that
r
0 =
P
k
r
0
k

P
k
rk +  > r, a contradiction.
Therefore in the Bergstrom-Blume-Varian model, we must conclude that greater wealth
inequality must lead to greater provision of the public good. Roughly speaking, wealth
inequality raises the contribution costs of noncontributors and lowers the cost to contributors.
The former has no effect: noncontributors are noncontributors and it does not matter
whether their costs go up or not. The latter increases contributions; hence the result.
It should be pointed out that the effect on total (utilitarian) surplus is uncertain. After
all, utilities are concave and disequalizing them through regressive transfers of wealth has
inherently negative consequences. However, sometimes one can argue that overall welfare
goes up. A disequalization of wealth has three effects: (i) it increases rich utilities (positive);
(b) it lowers poor utilities (negative) and (c) it increases public goods supply (positive). To
compute net effects think of a two-person example in which 1 is a contributor and 2 is not.
If we are very close to the contribution threshold for 2, we have that
w1 − r1 ' w2
by the equalization proposition above. Now a disequalization of wealth will have no firstorder
effect on the sum of utilities, while it will have a first-order positive effect on public
good provision.
In the next section, we will see an important sense in which Proposition 8.4 may not be
robust.
Inequality and Incentives 167
8.2 Inequality in Access
In this section, we assume that the output is a private good, though with a little bit of clever
renormalization most of the analysis goes through with mixed public-private goods.
The objective is to analyze access inequalities, so we will have the produced output divided in
some given way among the contributing agents. The question is: how does the inequality
in this division affect efficiency?
Our focus will be on an aspect of production that we did not consider in the last section: we
will allow for the inputs of different agents to be complements in producing the joint output.
The maintenance of an irrigation network is a good generic example: the maintenance
of different stretches of an irrigation channel is complementary, and the idea of access
inequalities also makes sense (think of irrigation being important in proportion to the amount
of land being farmed).
Other than complementarities, we keep everything very simple. Individual utility functions
are identical, and taken to be linear both in consumption and in contributions (which, in
keeping with the maintenance example) we will now call effort e. Thus each agent i seeks to
maximize ci − ei
, and chooses ei
to
(8.5) max
ei
λiF(ei
, e−i) − ei
where the notation e−i stands for the vector e with the ith component removed.
An equilibrium is an effort vector e
∗ with the property that for every i, e
∗
i
solves (8.5), given
e
∗
−i
.
An effort vector eˆ is efficient if it maximizes the expression
Sˆ ≡ F(e) −
Xn
i=1
ei
over all possible effort vectors. Thus Sˆ is the maximal surplus that can be generated in
the economy. Assume that appropriate end-point conditions hold so that the maximization
problem above is well-defined.
Define the surplus S
∗ associated with any equilibrium e
∗ by the expression F(e
∗
) −
Pn
i=1
e
∗
i
.
Obviously, S
∗ ≤ Sˆ in any equilibrium. Take Sˆ − S
∗
to be our measure of the inefficiency of an
equilibrium.
This definition naturally induces a class of inefficiency measures for a given level of “access
inequality”, as proxied by `. We adopt the following definition: the inefficiency I(`) of access
inequality ` is given by
(8.6) I(`) ≡ min{Sˆ − S
∗
| S
∗
is the surplus associated with some equilibrium e
∗ under `}.
The question that we seek to explore is: which levels of access inequality minimize
inefficiency? Writers such as Mancur Olson have stressed that unequal sharing rules are
good for efficiency, because they minimize the free-rider problem. We may summarize this
intuition in the following
168 Inequality and Incentives
Proposition 8.5. Suppose that F is an increasing, concave function of the sum of efforts: F(e) =
f(
Pn
i=1
ei) for some increasing differentiable concave f satisfying the Inada endpoint conditions. Let
` = (λ1, . . . , λn) and `
0 = (λ
0
1
, . . . , λ0
n
) be two different access inequalities, with the property that
maxi λi > maxi λ
0
i
. Then I(`) < I(`
0
). Moreover, I(`) → 0 as ` converges to any of the unit vectors.
Proof. Let M(`) ≡ maxi λi
. Then in any equilibrium e
∗ under `, e
∗
i
is positive only if λi = M(`),
and consequently, if E
∗ ≡
Pn
i=1
e
∗
i
, E
∗ must maximize M(`)f(E)−E with respect to E. Thus I(`)
is simply Sˆ − M(`)f(E
∗
) + E
∗
. It is easy to check that I(`) is monotonically decreasing in M(`)
and indeed, that I(`) → 0 along any sequence such that M(`) → 1.
Thus under some conditions, inequality of sharing is conducive to efficiency. These
conditions require that output be a function of the sum of efforts. This assumption may
be particularly cogent in the case of lobbying, where the effectiveness of lobbying may be a
function of the sum of monetary contributions.
However, in many production activities, the efforts of different individuals may be
complements in production. The following equally simple proposition considers the extreme
Leontief case, to provide a stark contrast to Proposition 8.5.
Proposition 8.6. Suppose that F is an increasing concave function of the scale of activity, where
scale is determined by equi-proportional contribution of efforts: F(e) = f(mini ei) for some increasing
differentiable concave f satisfying the Inada endpoint conditions. Let ` = (λ1, . . . , λn) and `
0 =
(λ
0
1
, . . . , λ0
n
) be two different access inequalities, with the property that mini λi > mini λ
0
i
. Then
I(`) < I(`
0
).
Proof. Note that in this case we have a continuum of equilibria for each possible level of
access inequality `. These are characterized as follows.
Define m(`) ≡ mini λi
. Then for each `, e
∗
is an equilibrium vector of efforts if and only if
e
∗

= . . . = e
∗
n = e (say), and m(`)f
0
(e) ≥ 1. Thus
I(`) = Sˆ − m(`)f(e) + ne.
It is easy to check that I(`) is a decreasing function of m(`).
Thus in this case, we have exactly the opposite result: equality is conducive to efficiency,
though unlike the case of proposition 8.5, we never obtain full efficiency (it is easy to check
that I(`) is bounded away from zero). We may therefore conjecture that the least inefficient
access inequality varies in some systematic way with the degree of complementarity in
production.
8.2.1 More on Access Inequalities. The analysis above suggests that the degree of
substitution will play a role in determining whether or not inequality is good for efficiency.
To capture this idea, parameterize production so it runs the gamut from perfect to zero
substitutability of effort is to use a CES structure for the vector of efforts. Thus we may take
F to have the form

It is possible to use the equations (8.8) and (8.13) to run some simple consistency checks.
Propositions 8.5 and 8.6 may be obtained by the taking of appropriate limits in the above
maximization exercise. The more general issue is to calculate the values of ` to intermediate
problems.
We do not have a complete solution to this problem. But here are some observations.
170 Inequality and Incentives
Proposition 8.7. If σ ≥ 1/2, then perfect equality maximizes constrained surplus.
Proof. Let λ = (λ1, . . . , λn) be a vector of nonnegative shares summing to unity. We already
have a closed form for the surplus S

assume in what follows. [The logarithmic case σ = 1 will be discussed at the end of the
proof.]
We will use this expression to establish the proposition. To this end, let us compute the
derivative of S

Note: we will be done if we can show that whenever λi < λk
, then ∆(λi) > ∆(λk
). For this
would mean that a small transfer from the higher share to the lower share would raise total
surplus. Because the terms within curly brackets in (8.15) are unchanged in this comparison,
it will suffice to show that the function

We distinguish between two cases.
Case 1. σ ∈ (1/2, 1). In this case it is easy to see that θ ∈ (0, 1) and that γ < 1. Using this
information in (8.17), it follows right away that ∆
0
(x) < 0.

Case 2. σ > 1. In this case it is easy to see that θ < 0 and that γ > 1.1 Using part of this
information (the fact that θ < 0), we see from (8.17) that ∆

(x) < 0 if
(θ − 1){

But this inequality follows from direct inspection, and we are done.
Notice that the logarithmic case σ = 1 remains uncovered. I believe this should be established
by separate computation.
Proposition 8.8. If σ < 1/2, there exist population sizes for which equal division cannot be optimal.
Proof. As a construction for the proof, set up the equal minority problem with m people
receiving equal shares 1/m: call this vector λm. Then it is easy to see that
(8.19) S

Define m∗ by the smallest integer such that

I will now show that S

(λm) > S

(λn) for any n > m∗
, which proves that perfect equality is
impossible when n exceeds m∗
. To this end, we pretend that m is a continuous variable in
(8.19). It will suffice to show that the derivative of S(m) with respect to m is negative for all
m > m∗
. Differentiating (8.19) with respect to m, we need to show that
(b + 1)m − αb < 0

now examine this.

for all m > m∗
. Using the definition of b and m∗
, this is a matter of simple algebra.
The simulations (see below) show a strange area where two players receive different shares.
It looks subtle. The following proposition takes us part of the way towards resolving these
strange issues.
Proposition 8.9. There can be no more than two distinct positive values of the share in any
constrained optimum. Moreover, there can be no more than one person endowed with the lower of the
two positive values of the share.
Proof. To prove this, recall the expression for ∆(λi) in (8.15), and note the following:
Lemma 8.1. Let λ be a share vector. If ∆(λi) and ∆(λk
) are different for two positive values λi and
λk
in the share vector, then that share vector cannot be a constrained optimum.
The proof of this lemma is trivial. Simply transfer shares from the one with lower ∆-value
to the one with the higher ∆-value. Since the shares in question are both positive, there is no
constraint to doing this in any “direction” we please.
Given Lemma 8.1, our question boils down to this: for how many distinct and positive
values of x can ∆(x) have the same value? Recall that ∆(x) is defined in (8.16);2
it may be
written as
(8.21) ∆(x) = θx
θ−1 − Cxθ
,
where
C ≡
α(θ + 1)Pn
j=1 λ
θ
j
Pn
j=1 λ
θ
j
[1 − γ(1 − αλj)]
> 0.
Now we prove the following observation: the function ∆(x), for x ≥ 0 is “single-peaked” (though
not necessarily concave): first rising, then falling.
To show this be a little careful, because the function is not necessarily strictly concave (try
θ > 2). But it is easy to do (details omitted).
Now we are done with the first part of the proposition. Such a function can exhibit the same
value for at most two distinct points in the domain.
To complete the proof, let a denote the smaller of the two positive values of the share. We will
show that if two (or more) persons are given a, we can improve the surplus by transferring
some share from one of them to the other. To this end, think of the share of these two
individuals as variables x and y. “Initially”, x = y = a. Holding all other shares constant, we
may think of the aggregate surplus simply as a function S(x, y). For some  > 0, we know
from the mean value theorem for multivariate functions (see, e.g., Hoffman (1975, Section
8.4, Theorem 6)) that
(8.22) S(a + , a − ) − S(a, a) = [S1(xˆ, yˆ) − S2(xˆ, yˆ)]
2
It is true that the shares also appear within the curly brackets. But this does not matter as we are simply
comparing for different shares “over the cross-section” and the share vector does not change.
Inequality and Incentives 173
where superscripts denote the appropriate partial derivatives, and xˆ can be chosen to be
strictly larger than yˆ.
3 Now we know that
(8.23) S1(xˆ, yˆ) = θxˆ
θ−1 − C(xˆ, yˆ)xˆ
θ
,
and
(8.24) S2(xˆ, yˆ) = θyˆ
θ−1 − C(xˆ, yˆ)yˆ
θ
,
where C(xˆ, yˆ) is exactly the same C as before (see definition just following (8.21)), but with
two of the arguments made explicit to remind the reader that xˆ and yˆ enter there as well.
Recall now that
θz
θ−1 − C(a, a)z
θ
is strictly increasing in z around z = a. It follows that the same is true of the slightly perturbed
function
θz
θ−1 − C(xˆ, yˆ)z
θ
around z = a. Using this information in (8.23) and (8.24), it is therefore easy to see that for
 > 0 but small enough,
S1(xˆ, yˆ) > S2(xˆ, yˆ).
Applying this inequality to (8.22), we may conclude that S(a + , a − ) > S(a, a): surplus is
increased by a small transfer between two persons with the same lower share, and the proof
is complete.
Tentative Notes on Simulations:
Unfortunately, we could not obtain analytically the parameter values for which the unequal
pair dominates equal minority with m = 1, 2. We therefore turned towards simulations, the
results of which we now examine. The following observations were obtained through the
simulations:
(i) The area in the parameter space (α, σ) such that the inefficiency-minimizing distribution
of shares corresponds to the equal minority case is large. In other words, for most values
of the parameters, sharing equally among a limited (smaller than n) number of agents is
the least inefficient distribution of shares. When σ ≥
1
2
, perfect equality is the (second-best)
optimal distribution of shares.
(ii) There is a non-trivial area in the parameter space (α, σ) such that inefficiency is minimized
by distributing shares unequally, and between only two agents. However, the two shares
tend to be more equal as the degree of complementarity between efforts increases.
(iii) For σ < 0.2179, the optimal distribution of shares corresponds to the one of perfect
inequality, where one agent concentrates all the shares, for all values of α. Thus, if
substitutability between efforts is high enough, perfect inequality a la Olson appears
to minimize inefficiency. This is a subtle observation that requires greater analytical
investigation.
3The reason for this is that it is possible to take xˆ ∈ (a, a + ) and yˆ ∈ (a − , a). While the statement of the theorem
in Hoffman (1975) does not make this clear, the proof — see last two lines — does.
174 Inequality and Incentives
8.3 Egalitarianism and Incentives
Note. What follows has been taken from Ray and Ueda (1996) and needs to be shortened for
the purpose of these lecture notes.
A social planner’s concern for egalitarianism might lead to a dilution of incentives, and
therefore a loss in efficiency. In an important class of situations, the efficiency loss arises
because the planner cannot credibly commit to a future course of action, such as the
decision not to tax an individual or group making efficiency-enhancing investments. So
these investments are not made, or more generally, undersupplied.
Consider, then, the following class of situations. A group of agents is collectively engaged in
a joint production activity, where the output from production is to be distributed among the
members of the group. The agents (represented by a social planner, perhaps) are interested
in maximizing the value of a Bergson-Samuelson social welfare function defined on their
own utilities. However, while this welfare function represents their social values, individual
actions are taken on an entirely selfish basis. Suppose that to achieve the desired outcome,
each agent must take an observable action, followed by some collective action — the “social
planner’s move”. Suppose, moreover, that a collective action (contingent on individual
decisions) cannot be credibly committed in advance.4
Specifically, define a soft mechanism to be one that specifies a second best division of the
output (relative to the social welfare function) conditional on every possible input vector. We
wish to compare the resulting equilibria of the “soft game” so induced, with the first best
under the very same welfare function.
8.3.1 Model.
8.3.1.1 Technology and Individual Preferences Consider a group of n individuals (n ≥ 2)
producing a single output. Output is produced by the joint efforts of these individuals
according to the production function
(8.25) Y = F(e)
where e = (e1, . . . ,en) is a (nonnegative) vector of efforts. We assume
(A.1) F is continuous and concave with F(0) = 0 and differentiable whenever F > 0, with ∂F(e)
∂ei
≡
Fi(e) > 0.
Each individual has preferences over pairs of consumption (c) and leisure (l). We assume
4A central example is the problem of allocating funds from a Central Government to different State Governments.
Typically, each state carries out a number of different expenditure programs, which are financed from central
funds and state revenues. The Center would like to channel proportionately greater funds to the poorer states.
At the same time, the Center would like to induce each state to carry out activities that will raise per capita income
in that state. But the former goal places limits on the punishments that a Center can credibly impose on a state
for not taking actions to further certain desired goals.

is a normal good.
5
Each individual has a labour endowment Li
. Thus, for each i,
(8.26) Li = li + ei
Let E be the product of intervals [0, Li] over all i. Note that whenever e ∈ E, we shall
have li given by (2), for i = 1, . . . , n. Keeping this in mind, define an outcome as a pair
(c, e) = ((c1, . . . , cn); (e1, . . . ,en)), such that c ≥ 0, e ∈ E, and
(8.27) c1 + c2 + . . . + cn = F(e)
8.3.1.2 Social Preferences The social planner is presumed to possess Bergson-Samuelson
preferences satisfying standard restrictions:
(A.3) (i) Society’s preferences are representable by a C
2 welfare indicator W : R2n
+ → R, defined on
2n-tuples of consumption-leisure vectors. This welfare function is strictly quasiconcave. Moreover,
for each l ∈ E and each i, ci
is not an inferior good under the function W(., l).
(ii) There exists a function V (which will be C
2
by part (i) and (A.2)) such that W(c, l) =
V(u
1
(c1, l1), . . . , u
n
(cn, ln)). Moreover, ∂V(u)
∂u
i ≡ Vi(u) > 0 for all i.
8.3.1.3 First Best The planner would like to maximize social welfare. This is achieved by
an outcome (c, e) that maximizes W(c, L − e), where L ≡ (L1, L2, . . . , Ln) is the vector of labor
endowments. From Assumptions 1 and 3 it follows that there is a unique outcome (c
∗
, e
∗
)
that solves this problem. Call this outcome the first best.
Some minor restrictions on the first-best are summarized in the following assumption.6
(FB) There is at least one individual i such that e∗
i
> 0 and l∗
i
≡ Li − e
∗
i
> 0. Moreover, the first best
output is larger than the optimal output that would be chosen by any one individual acting on his
own: F(e
∗
) > F(0, . . . , 0,eˆj
, 0, . . . , 0), where eˆj solves
max0≤ej≤Lj
u
j
(F(0, . . . , 0,ej
, 0, . . . , 0), Lj − ej). Finally, under the first-best, each individual obtains
at least as much utility as total inaction (which yields ui
(0, Li)).
8.3.1.4 The Soft Mechanism The idea of a no-commitment mechanism, or soft mechanism,
is based on the postulate that the planner cannot avoid maximizing welfare ex post, even
though this may be detrimental to the maximization of welfare ex ante. Formally, for each
given vector e ∈ E, consider the problem:
(8.28) max
c
W(c, L − e)
subject to the constraint that (c, e) must be an outcome.
5The assumption that leisure is a normal good implies the restriction u

6All the restrictions are not used in all the propositions, but the conditions are so minor that we do not feel it
useful to separate this list into separate components.
176 Inequality and Incentives
By (A.1) and (A.3), there is a unique vector c(e) that solves (4). We will refer to (c(e), e) as an ex
post outcome. This captures, in an extreme way, the inability to impose arbitrary punishments
on deviants. The lack of commitment creates limitations on the incentive mechanisms that
can be used to stimulate production.
The collection of ex post outcomes (c(e), e), for e ∈ E, induces a soft game in the obvious way:
Player i chooses ei ∈ [0, Li]. If the vector e is chosen, i consumes ci(e), thus generating the
payoff u
i
(ci(e), Li − ei).
8.3.1.5 An Additional Restriction We now have sufficient terminology to introduce an
additional joint assumption on technology and preferences, which will be used to derive
one of the main results. To motivate this assumption, first consider a standard property of
the first best outcome, which can be easily verified: If e
∗
i
< Li
,
(8.29) u
i
c
(c
∗
i
, l
∗
i
)Fi(e
∗
) ≤ u
i
l
(c
∗
i
, l
∗
i
)
(indeed, with equality holding if e
∗
i
> 0).
The intuition is simple. If this inequality did not hold, i’s effort could be raised a little with
all the additional output being credited to him. His utility would be higher, with every other
utility remaining constant. Social welfare goes up, a contradiction to the fact that we have a
first best outcome to start with.
The additional assumption that we wish to make is related closely to (5). Specifically, we
suppose:
(A.4) For each ex post outcome (c(e), e) such that F(e) ≥ F(e
∗
), there is i with ei > 0, and
(8.30) u
i
c
(ci
, li)Fi(e) ≤ u
i
l
(ci
, li)
where ci(e) ≡ ci > 0.
This assumption looks plausible, because as output moves above the first best, we would
expect that marginal products do not increase, while the marginal rate of substitution
between consumption and leisure tilts in favor of leisure. Thus if (5) already holds at
the first best, we expect this relationship to be maintained (for at least one individual) for
outcomes with higher output.
However, it is only fair to point out (A.4) is not automatically implied by (A.1) - (A.3).
However, experimentation with different functional forms suggests that it is implied by a
large subclass of welfare functions, individual preferences and production technologies.
For instance, suppose (in addition to (A.1)–(A.3)) that individual utilities are separable as
the sum of concave functions of consumption and leisure, that total output is some concave,
smooth function of the sum of individual efforts, and that the social welfare function has a
separable and concave representation in utilities.
Consider some ex post outcome (c(e), e), distinct from the first best, but with the property
that at least as much output is being produced as in the first best: F(e) ≥ F(e
∗
). There must
be some individual i with ei > e
∗
i
. In the case under consideration, it will be the case that
at least one such individual gets ci(e) ≥ c
∗
i
(remember that at least as much output is being
Inequality and Incentives 177
produced). Furthermore, since output is no lower, marginal product cannnot have increased
relative to the first-best. Putting all this together with (5) and using the convexity properties
of preferences and technology, it should be the case that
u
i
c
(ci(e), Li − ei)Fi(e) ≤ u
i
l
(ci(e), Li − ei)
for this individual, which is (6).
Consider, therefore, the following formalization of the separable case:
(A.4*) (i) u
i
is additively separable in (c, l), (ii) F(e) is of the form f(e1 + . . . + en), for some
f : R+ → R+, and (iii) V is separable in individual utilities.
Our motivating argument above shows that under (A.1)—(A.3), (A.4*) implies (A.4).
8.3.2 Egalitarianism and Incentives.
8.3.2.1 Egalitarianism Yields Underproduction...
Proposition 8.10. Under (A.1) - (A.3) and (FB), the first best cannot be achieved as some equilibrium
of the soft game. Moreover, if (A.4) holds, every equilibrium of the soft game must involve
underproduction.
Proposition 8.10 verifies an intuitive conjecture: when a team cannot precommit to
adequately punish deviants, the first best cannot be achieved. Specifically, in this model
there is underproduction relative to the first best.
It is perhaps worth mentioning that while Proposition ?? appears intuitive (especially
because it is related to other inefficiency notions, such as the Marshallian inefficiency
of sharecropping, or the holdup problem), it is far from being obviously true in the
present context. For instance, if individual utility has a separable linear representation
in consumption, the proposition is, in general, false: there are equilibria that attain the first
best.7 Moreover, without (A.4), whether there is underproduction or not is an open question.
Most significantly, the assumptions of Proposition 8.10 do not cover the case of Rawlsian
social preferences, and as we shall see in the next section, our proposition fails in this case.
It might help, therefore, to sketch the proof of Proposition 8.10 for a special case. Assume
that individual preferences have a strictly concave representation that is separable in
consumption and leisure, and that given this representation, the Bergson-Samuelson welfare
function has a representation that is strictly concave and separable in individual utilities.
Furthermore, assume that total output is a concave, increasing function f of the sum of
individual efforts. This is the case covered by (A.4*).
Now consider an ex post outcome (c, e) with overproduction relative to the first best. Someone
must be putting in more effort relative to the first best. Call that someone i. Evaluated at
the first best consumption vector, i must now have a higher marginal weight in the social
welfare function than he had before. In the ex post outcome under consideration, therefore, i

together with the convexity of preferences and technology, it is easy to see that

which just means that (A.4) is automatically satisfied in this special case.
Now, suppose that i reduces his effort level a tiny bit. Perform the thought experiment of
cutting i’s consumption by exactly the resulting fall in output. By the inequality (8.31), this
has a nonnegative first-order effect on i
0
s utility. If the outcome is to be a Nash equilibrium,
therefore, i’s true consumption decline must be at least of this order. But now note that this
decline must have a first-order effect on i’s marginal utility of consumption, which rises.
Moreover, by the supposition that i is no better off, the marginal welfare contribution of his
utility is no lower. It is now easy to check that in this new situation, the first-order conditions
for ex post welfare maximization are destroyed. For because i is being made to take at least
the entire output loss (as we have argued above), there must be some other individual whose
consumption is no lower. For this other person, exactly the reverse changes must occur in
the marginal conditions. So, if the first order conditions were holding earlier (as they must
have), they cannot be holding now! This contradicts ex post welfare maximization, and
proves that the original outcome could not have been an equilibrium.
8.3.2.2 ...But Not With a Rawlsian Planner Our main theme relates the degree of egalitarianism
to the degree of efficiency failure. It will be convenient to begin by exploring the most
extreme form of egalitarianism: Rawlsian social preferences. In a later section, we will carry
out the more complicated exercise of varying the welfare function over different degrees of
egalitarianism.
Observe that the Rawlsian case is not covered by Proposition 8.10. That result rests on a
postulate that is seemingly so innocuous that we have not emphasized it in the discussion
(though, of course, it is formally stated in (A.3)). It is that social welfare is strictly increasing
in every utility level, for each vector of utilities. Rawlsian social preferences do not satisfy
this condition. Indeed, this observation has striking consequences, as we shall see.
We first define Rawlsian preferences. To do so we need a benchmark comparison. This is
summarized in the following assumption:
(R) Society is indifferent between the complete inaction of any two individuals. Thus if the Rawlsian
welfare is written as
(8.32) V(u) = min
i
u
i
where utilities have already been normalized so that ui
(0, Li) = u
j
(0, Lj) for all i and j.
The first best Rawlsian optimum involves the maximization of the expression in (8.32),
subject to the constraints that u
i = u
i
(ci
, li) for all i and that (c, e) is an outcome. Just as before,
there is a unique first best outcome; call it (c
∗
,e
∗
).
Ex post outcomes are defined exactly as they were earlier. It is easy to see that for each e ∈ E,
there is a unique consumption vector c(e) that solves the ex post maximization problem.
Inequality and Incentives 179
The collection of ex post outcomes induces a soft game just as before, and we may study its
equilibria.
Proposition 8.11. Under (A.1), (A.2), (FB) and (R), the Rawlsian first best is an equilibrium of
the Rawlsian soft game. Furthermore, any equilibrium which gives at least one agent strictly more
utility than the utility from inaction must be the Rawlsian first best outcome.
(1) One might wonder whether the strikingly positive result of Proposition 8.11 is due to the
fact that the Rawlsian egalitarian optimum is so devoid of efficiency properties that we do
not have any incentive problem at all to maintain it. But this is not the case. For instance,
consider any special case of this model that is symmetric across all agents. It is easy to see
that the first best outcome is invariant across all symmetric quasi-concave welfare functions,
including the Rawlsian one.
(2) There is only one qualification in Proposition 8.11. To prove that an equilibrium must be
the Rawlsian first-best, we assume that at least one individual receives strictly more utility
than he receives from inaction. There may exist an equilibrium involving total inaction. This
will happen if the technology has the property that F(e) = 0 whenever n−1 components of e
equal zero. On the other hand, if the technology is such that output depends on the sum of
the efforts (and if right-hand marginal utilities are defined and strictly positive everywhere)
then our qualification can be dispensed with.8
Thus, in contrast to standard intuition, extreme egalitarianism might actually has pleasing
incentive properties. Egalitarianism applies not only to the choice of the social optimum,
but in the treatment of deviants from the optimum. A greater concern for egalitarianism
goes hand in hand with the ability to credibly mete out stronger punishments.
Apart from the technicalities, the proof of Proposition 8.11 is very simple and general.
Under convexity of the feasible set and preferences, the Rawlsian criterion has the following
property. All individual utilities move in the same direction from one ex post outcome to
another. Consequently, the Rawlsian first best is always an equilibrium of the Rawlsian soft
game. For if someone could improve his utility by a deviation, he would improve the utility
of everyone else in the process. This would contradict the fact that the earlier outcome was
first best.9
The second part of the result — that every equilibrium must be first best — is model-specific
in two respects. The convexity and the differentiability features of the model must both be
exploited. These are used to guarantee that if an allocation is not first best, then there is
some small, unilateral change in someone’s effort level that creates an ex post outcome with
8Our requirement that the production function be differentiable at positive output is used in the proof. Concave,
increasing production functions which produce no output when n−1 effort components equal zero are not (right
hand) differentiable at 0, even though all partial (right hand) derivatives may exist at 0.
9
It should be pointed out that this joint movement of utilities in the same direction is also a feature of the case in
which utilities have a separable linear representation in consumption. To see this, let u
i
(c, l) = aic + bi(l), where
ai > 0 and bi
is an increasing, smooth, concave function. Assume that V(u) = v1(u1) + · · · + vn(un), where each vi
is smooth, increasing, and strictly concave. Now look at the ex post outcomes of this model. If all consumptions
are strictly positive, then the necessary and sufficient conditions characterizing ex post optimality are that for
all i, j, v
0
i
(u
i
(ci
, li))ai = v

. The co-movement of utilities should now be apparent. So in this case as well,
the first best can be supported as an equilibrium of the soft game.
180 Inequality and Incentives
a higher Rawlsian value. Again, using the Rawlsian criterion and the equal-utility property
yielded by convexity, the individual who makes the change must participate in its benefits,
thereby destroying the equilibrium possibilities of the given outcome.
8.3.2.3 Changing Egalitarianism The result of the previous section, and the discussion
following it, suggest an even stronger observation: that as the extent of egalitarianism
increases, the degree of underproduction should monotonically decline. Proposition 8.11
would be the limiting case of such an observation. The purpose of this section is to
demonstrate such a possibility.
We consider a symmetric version of our model, described formally as follows. First, any
permutation of e produces the same output level as F(e). Second, every individual’s
preferences is represented by the same function u. Finally, the social welfare function is
symmetric:
(8.33) W(c, l) = V (u(c1, l1), ..., u(cn, ln))
where V is symmetric. We will fix the individual representation u, and analyze the effect of
changing egalitarianism by altering the form of V in a manner made precise below.
The following assumption (in addition to those already maintained) will be made on the
fixed cardinal representation, u, of individual preferences.
(A.5) There exists a cardinal representation such that u is strictly concave in c, and V is quasiconcave
in u.
10
We begin by discussing how to compare the “degree of egalitarianism” among different
V’s, or more generally, among different social welfare orderings on vectors of individual
utility. Our definition, while not formally requiring symmetric social welfare orderings, is
best viewed in this background. Let S and S
0
be two social welfare orderings for utility
vectors u. We will say that S
0
is at least as egalitarian as S if for all u, v ∈ Rn
, and for all i and
j, the condition
(8.34) uk = vk
for k , i, j, vSu, and |vi − vj
| < |ui − uj
|
implies vS
0u.
That is, S
0
is more egalitarian than S if it prefers every redistribution plan to narrow the
difference between two individuals’ utility that R prefers as well . This can be viewed as an
extension of the Pigou-Dalton principle for utility distributions (see, for example, Moulin
[13]), applied to a comparison of any two social welfare orderings.
Some remarks on this last observation will clarify our definition. Observe that under our
definition, a social welfare ordering S
0
is at least as egalitarian as the utilitarian welfare
ordering if the condition
uk = vk
for k , i, j, ui + uj ≤ vi + vj
, and |vi − vj
| < |ui − uj
|
10The fix on a cardinal representation that is strictly concave is not necessary for the results (as long as (A.3) is
maintained), but it greatly simplifies the writing of the proofs.
Inequality and Incentives 181
implies vS
0u. Note that the condition above is just a specialization of (8.34), when S is
the utilitarian ordering. Specializing even further so that ui + uj = vi + vj
in the above
condition, we obtain the Pigou-Dalton principle for utility distributions. In other words, a
social welfare ordering which is at least as egalitarian as the utilitarian ordering satisfies the
Pigou-Dalton principle. Our suggested relation is therefore an extension of this idea.
The argument above suggests that as we progressively move “towards egalitarianism” in
this ordering, we obtain social welfare functions that are “more willing” to trade off total
utility for interpersonal equality.
This definition, and the subsequent discussion leads to two general observations. First,
in the class of social welfare functions considered in this paper, every such function is at
least as egalitarian as the utilitarian function.11 Second, the Rawlsian function is at least
as egalitarian as any of these social welfare functions.12 In short, the utilitarian and the
Rawlsian social welfare orderings are two extremes of the social welfare functions we are
considering, in the spectrum of the degree of egalitarianism defined here.
In our model, social welfare orderings are given by the functions satisfying (A.2) and (A.3),
which includes differentiability. Let V and V
0
be two such symmetric functions. Then we can
show that V
0
is at least as egalitarian as V if and only if
(8.35) For all u and for all i, j ∈ {1, ..., n}, ui ≥ uj ⇔
Vi
0
Vj
0 ≤
Vi
Vj
We omit a proof of this result (it is available on request).13 But the interpretation should
be quite natural. When one individual j has a lower utility than another individual i, the
“more egalitarian” social welfare function assigns a higher (relative) marginal welfare to i.
The social marginal rate of substitution between i and j is tilted in favor of j by the more
egalitarian welfare function.
To obtain a clearer idea of the partial ordering proposed here, consider two classes of social
welfare functions. The first is the Atkinson family, which is represented by the form
(8.36) [Xn
i=1
u
ρ
i
]
1/ρ
11This is because increasing, strictly quasiconcave welfare functions will indeed rank v over u whenever the
specialization of condition (8.34) discussed in the text happens to hold.
12This is easily seen as follows. Suppose that for some social welfare ordering S, and utility vectors u and v,
condition (8.34) holds but nevertheless, u is preferred by the Rawlsian ordering to v. This means, in particular,
that min{ui
, uj} > min{vi
, vj}. But because |ui − uj
| > |vi − vj
|, this implies that (ui
, uj) vector dominates (vi
, vj). But
now we have a contradiction to the assumption that vSu.
13It is worth noting that the asserted equivalence is an analogue of a result in Moulin [13, Lemma 2.2], which
characterizes a differentiable social welfare function (called a “collective utility function”) that satisfies the
Pigou-Dalton principle for utility distributions.
182 Inequality and Incentives
where ρ ∈ (−∞, 1]. It is easy to check that higher degrees of egalitarianism correspond
to lower values of ρ. In particular, the case ρ = 1 yields the utilitarian, and ρ = −∞, the
Rawlsian social welfare ordering.
The second class is the ”constant absolute risk-aversion” family, which is given by the form
(8.37) −
Xn
i=1
exp(−ηui)
where η ∈ (0, ∞). A higher value of η is associated with a more egalitarian function, and
the two extreme values of η (0 and ∞) again give the utilitarian and the Rawlsian social
orderings respectively.
Now, let us return to the model. An outcome is symmetric if all individuals work equally hard,
and consume equally. In the symmetric model, symmetric effort by individuals induces a
symmetric outcome, in which c(e, ...,e) = (c, ..., c) and c =
1
n
F(e, ...,e). The first best (c
∗
,e
∗
) is
also a symmetric allocation, and the allocation is independent of the social welfare function.
We will restrict our discussion to the class of symmetric equilibria of the soft game.
In what follows, it will be convenient to consider a modified soft game where all but the first
individual choose the same level of effort. Then the ex-post outcome assigns the same level
of consumption for those providing this effort. Denote the generated levels of consumption
by
(8.38) (c1(e1,e; V), c(e1,e; V))
where V is the social welfare function determining consumption, and e and c are the common
values for all but the first individual. The first individual’s best response to e is the set of
solutions to the problem of maximizing his indirect utility function with respect to e1 ∈
[0, L]. Denote this set by B(e; V). B(e; V) is a compact-valued and upper hemi-continuous
correspondence of e . We will need to further assume:
(A.6) u(c1(e1,e; V), L − e1) is single-peaked with respect to e1.
Then, B(e; V) is convex-valued and the existence of a symmetric equilibrium for each V is
guaranteed.14
By the degree of underproduction in any outcome, we refer to the difference between the
first-best production level and the level of aggregate production under that outcome. The
following proposition establishes that while the degree of underproduction is positive, the
degree of underproduction must fall with rising egalitarianism.
Proposition 8.12. Assume a symmetric model satisfying (A.1)—(A.3), (A.5), (A.6) and (FB). Then
every symmetric equilibrium of the soft game involves underproduction. Now consider two welfare

forms that we have tried satisfy this assumption.

functions V and V0
, where V0
at least as egalitarian as V. Then, for each symmetric equilibrium
under V, there exists a symmetric equilibrium under V0
such that the degree of underproduction is
not more for the latter.
This verifies that the Rawlsian case discussed in Proposition 8.11 is not an exception or some
quirky failure of continuity. For symmetric equilibria of the symmetric model, increased
egalitarianism never increases the degree of underproduction.15
8.3.3 Extensions. We briefly consider some extensions, as well as possible objections to
the setting in which these results have been derived.
1. Sinking past differences: In computing ex post optima, why do teams take account
of the sunk efforts already incurred by its members? It may be argued that bygones are
bygones, and that the social welfare function should ignore this. This point of view may be
identified with the assertion that individual utilities “should” be separable in consumption
and leisure, and that the social welfare function “should” be utilitarian. At least, that is
the only way to justify the assertion if one sticks to the Bergson-Samuelson setting. Such
particular functional forms are already accommodated as a special case of the paper, and
if one insists on such an interpretation, an entire class of welfare functions (including the
Rawlsian function) is simply removed from consideration.
On the other hand, one might take the sinking of past differences as a primitive, simply
asserting that ex post output is shared equally (in a symmetric model) irrespective of the
welfare function. We find it difficult to see what might justify such an assumption. Consider
any resource allocation problem. As long as resources are not allocated to everybody at
exactly the same point of time, this point of view leads to absurd allocations.
If one were to admit such a structure for the sake of argument, inefficiencies will always
arise, of course. But even then, it can be shown that as long as some weight is given to the
past, Proposition 8.12 will continue to hold. In particular, the Rawlsian welfare function will
exhibit the lowest degree of underproduction.
2. Emotions and credible punishments: One might proceed in the exactly the opposite
direction to (1). Deviants that do not adhere to the desired outcome might enjoy an entirely
different (and reduced) weight in the ex post welfare function. Emotions such as anger
or social disapproval might induce such changes, and in so doing, lend credibility to
punishments (for similar ideas, see, e.g., Frank [6]). It is to be expected that the degree
of inefficiency will be lowered in the presence of these emotions. But even so, as long as
the first best is thereby not automatically achieved, more egalitarian welfare functions will
possess better efficiency properties.
3. The observability of effort: The results of this paper rest critically on the assumption
that efforts are observable. We suspect that the results would extend to noisy observability,
15It is possible to find even stronger versions of this proposition in special cases. For instance, if the best-response
correspondence is single-valued, and social welfare functions are in the Atkinson class, we can show that
increased egalitarianism strictly lowers the maximal degree of underproduction. The qualification “maximal”
is due to the fact that equilibrium may not be unique.
184 Inequality and Incentives
though we have not checked this. Of course, if efforts are not observable at all, the results
cease to have any relevance.
4. Repeated Relationships: In a dynamic situation, teams would recognize that a departure
from the soft mechanism will serve them well in the longer run. It may be of interest to
study such repeated relationships. But as a prelude to that study, it is surely important to
analyze the “one-shot” relationship without precommitment, which is exactly what we do
here.
8.3.4 Discussion. While the connections between egalitarianism and inefficiency has long
been a subject of debate, there have been surprisingly few attempts to model the exact nature
of the tradeoff. To be sure, the sources of various tradeoffs are manifold in nature. This paper
investigates one potential source, and shows that the commonly held intuition is not valid,
at least in this case.
Specifically, this paper studies the idea that egalitarianism fails to uphold proper incentives
because credible punishments are thereby destroyed. This statement really has two parts to
it: one is the familiar “dilemma of the Samaritan” induced by the inability to precommit.
Organizations that cannot precommit, yet derive their sense of goal-fulfillment or welfare from
the welfare of its members, are particularly prone to these potential inefficiencies. Indeed,
organizational structures where the source of utility for the “principal” is directly opposed
to that for the “agent” will certainly do better (in terms of efficiency) compared to the
structures considered here.16 This is the intuition upheld by Proposition 8.10. An inability to
precommit the reward function results in inefficiency. While the particularresult proved is, to
our knowledge, new, there is nothing particularly surprising or novel about the underlying
theme.
But this is only one half of the idea. The second part goes further. It states that egalitarian
organizations faced with the inability to precommit are doubly cursed: they are inefficient on
the additional count that they cripple the incentive system (already weakened by the inability
to precommit) even further. In this paper, we argue that this assertion is wrong. Increased
egalitarianism restores incentives that are damaged by the lack of commitment (Proposition
8.12). Indeed, in the extreme case of Rawlsian egalitarianism, the precommitment and
no-precommitment yield exactly the same first-best outcomes.
The results in this section are provocative on two counts. First, they might inspire greater
interest in a challenging and crucially important area of research: the connections between
the ethic of equality and the yardstick of aggregate performance (such as GNP growth). The
second aspect is one that we have not emphasized in this paper, but of great interest, we
believe. This is the connection with the theory of implementation. By far the dominant
16Indeed, in the usual principal-agent setup the problem is trivial. If efforts are observable, the organization
is best off using a forcing contract. The contract demands that each individual must supply (at least) his first
best effort level. If this effort level is indeed supplied by all individuals, all individuals receive the first best
output division. If, however, these effort levels are not forthcoming, the contract promises dire consequences for
the individuals who have deviated. These threats indeed implement the first best (at least as one equilibrium),
and there is no incentive problem worth serious analysis. Authors such as Holmstrom (Holmstrom [8]) have
argued that the existence of a residual claimant (capitalist, manager) creates a credible threat to carry out these
punishments, such as retention of produced output, in the event of breach.
Inequality and Incentives 185
approach in this literature presumes that the planner can implement outcomes without
regard to ex post credibility. But there are many situations where it is natural to constrain
mechanisms off the equilibrium path by the provision that they should not be suboptimal
relative to the actions that have been taken and observed, and the social welfare function of
the planner. This may have some bearing on narrowing the class of allowable mechanisms
in implementation contexts.17
8.3.5 Proofs. Note. Equation numbering needs to be changed.
Lemma 8.2. Consider some ex post outcome (c(e), e) such that F(e) ≥ F(e
∗
), with the additional
property that for some individual i,
(8.39) u

Then such an outcome cannot be an equilibrium of the soft game.
Proof. Suppose that (c(e), e) ≡ (c, e) is an ex post outcome with F(e) > 0. Denote by Wi(c, l)
the partial derivative of W with respect to ci
. Then, under (A.1)–(A.3) and using the ex post
maximization problem (4), (c, e) must satisfy the following property: if ck > 0, then for all
j = 1, . . . , n,
(8.40) Wk
(c, l) ≥ Wj(c, l)
with equality whenever cj > 0.
We need a slightly stronger implication than (16). Let i be such that ei > 0, and suppose
that there is some k with ck = 0. Suppose, further, that there exists  > 0 such that for all
e
0
i
∈ (ei − ,ei), the ex post consumption vector c(e
0
i
, e−i) ≡ c
0 has c
0
k
> 0. Then, indeed, we
can say that (16) holds for this k even if ck = 0. We exclude the verification of this simple
observation.
Now, suppose that, contrary to the lemma, this outcome is an equilibrium of the soft game.
Let M be the set of all indices j such that either cj > 0, or with the property that there is  > 0
such that for all e
0
i
∈ (ei −,ei), the ex post consumption vector c(e
0
i
, e−i) ≡ c
0 has c
0
j
> 0. We are
going to consider the effect (on i’s utility) of a small reduction in ei by differential methods.
By the maximum theorem (and the uniqueness of ex post consumption (given effort)), c(e)
is a continuous function. Therefore the set M is all that counts for the analysis, and for all
k, j ∈ M, (16) holds with equality.
Note first that because (c, e) is an equilibrium and ei > 0, we have ci > 0. Consequently, i ∈ M.
Without loss of generality, number the indices in M as 1, . . . , m, and let i be rechristened with
the index 1. We now claim that m ≥ 2. Suppose not. Then, because (c, e) is an equilibrium, we
must have ej = 0 for all j , 1. Therefore, because F(e) ≥ F(e
∗
) and because we have assumed
that the first best output is larger than the output of any individual acting completely on his
own, we must have

that agents may renegotiate the outcome.
186 Inequality and Incentives
Because M = {1}, it follows from (17) and the definition of M that a small reduction in e1 will
raise 1’s welfare, because all other consumptions will continue at zero. This contradicts our
supposition that (c, e) is an equilibrium, and shows that m ≥ 2.
For all i ∈ M, we have the first order condition of the ex post maximization problem: for
some λ < 0,

Now, let us return to (19) and write down the solution for dc1

of the cofactor of the first 1 (from the left) in the first row of the matrix in (19), and Ui be
the determinant of the cofactor of Wi1, i = 1, . . . , m. Include in these the signs generated by
cofactor expansion. Let U∗ be the determinant of the matrix in (19). Then it can be seen that

so that (28) proves that a small reduction in e1 will raise the utility of 1 under the new ex
post outcome. This contradicts our supposition that (c, e) is an equilibrium, and completes
the proof of the lemma.
Proof of Proposition 1. Observe that the first best allocation is indeed an ex post outcome,
with positive output, satisfying (8.39) in Lemma 1. Given the assumption that at the first
188 Inequality and Incentives
best, there is i with (e
∗
i
, l
∗
i
)  0, (8.39) follows as a necessary condition describing the first
best. By Lemma 1, this outcome cannot be an equilibrium of the soft game.
If (A.4) holds, then consider any ex post outcome with F(e) ≥ F(e
∗
). It follows right away
from (A.4) that (8.39) is satisfied. By Lemma 1, this outcome cannot be an equilibrium of the
soft game.
Proof of Proposition 2. For any outcome (c, e), define its Rawlsian value as R(c, e) ≡
mini u
i
(ci
, li). Now note that under the first best outcome, we must have, for every i,
(8.53) R(c
∗
, e
∗
) = u
i
(c
∗
i
, l
∗

)
The reason is that for each i, either c

i
> 0 or l
∗
i
> 0 (or both), because u
i
(c
∗
i
, l
∗
i
) ≥ u
i
(0, Li).
Therefore, if (29) were not true, we could always improve the Rawlsian value of the outcome
by small changes.
Given this claim, we first prove that the first best outcome is indeed an equilibrium. Suppose
not. Then for some i, there is ei ∈ [0, Li] such that
(8.54) u
i
(ci
, li) > u
i
(c
∗
i
, l
∗
i
)
where ci
is the ith component of c ≡ c(e), where e ≡ (ei
, e
∗
−i
).
Because u
i
(c
∗
i
, l
∗
i
) ≥ u
i
(0, Li) and because (30) holds, it must be the case that ci > 0. It follows
that
(8.55) R(c, e) = u
i
(ci
, li)
For if not, the Rawlsian value of (c, e) can be improved by only changing the consumption
allocation, a contradiction to the fact that (c, e) is an ex post outcome (use the fact that ci > 0).
Combining (29), (30) and (31), we have
R(c, e) > R(c
∗
, e
∗
)
but this contradicts the fact that (c
∗
,e
∗
) is the Rawlsian first best.
Now we prove the second part of the proposition. First, we show that if (c, e) is an
equilibrium, then for all i = 1, . . . , n,
(8.56) R(c, e) = u
i
(ci
, li)
Suppose this is not true. Then for some pairi, j, u
i
(ci
, li) > u
j
(cj
, lj). But then it must be the case
(by an earlier argument) that ci = 0. Consequently, u
j
(cj
, lj) < u
i
(0, li) ≤ u
i
(0, Li) = u
j
(0, Lj),
where the last equality follows from normalization. But then, (c, e) cannot be an equilibrium,
for j can guarantee himself at least u
j
(0, Lj) by deviating.
With this established, we return to the main proof. Suppose that the proposition is false.
Then there exists an equilibrium (c, e) , (c
∗
, e
∗
), such that at least one player gets strictly
more utility than inaction. By virtue of (32) and assumption (R), it follows that every player
gets strictly more than inaction. This observation will be used below.
Because the first best is unique, R(c
∗
, e
∗
) > R(c, e). Define e(t) ≡ te + (1 − t)e
∗
for t ∈ [0, 1],
and c(t) ≡ c(e(t)). Then it is easy to check that R(c(t), e(t)) > R(c, e) for all t ∈ (0, 1) (use (A.1),
Inequality and Incentives 189
(A.2), (29) and (32)). Using (32), it follows that for all t ∈ (0, 1) and all i,
(8.57) u
i
(ci(t), li(t)) > u
i
(ci
, li)
Now we claim that the following is true:
There exists j such that either (i) ej = Lj and u
j
c
(cj
, lj)Fj(e) < u
j
l
(cj

j
l
(cj
, lj), or (iii) ej = 0 and u
j
c
(cj
, lj)Fj(e) > u
j
l
(cj
, lj).
To prove the claim, first recall that each player gets strictly more than inaction at (c, e), so
that by (A.2), (u
i
c
(ci
, li), u
i
l
(ci
, li))  0 for all i. Using (A.2) again, together with (33), we see
that for all i,
(ci(t) − ci) + (li(t) − li)
u
i
l
u
i
c
> 0
or equivalently, for all i,
(8.58) (ci(t) − ci) − (ei(t) − ei)
u
i
l
u
i
c
> 0
Now, if the claim is false, then, noting that ei(t) ∈ [0, Li] for all i, we can use (34) to deduce
that
(ci(t) − ci) − (ei(t) − ei)Fi(e) > 0
Summing this inequality over all i, we have
(8.59) F(e(t)) − F(e) > (e1(t) − e1)F1(e) + . . . + (en(t) − en)Fn(e)
Now observe that because (c, e) provides more utility than inaction, F(e) > 0. But then (35)
contradicts (A.1), which assumes that F is differentiable whenever F(e) > 0, and that F is
concave. This establishes the claim.
Pick j as given by the claim. If part (i) of the claim is true, notice that because (c, e) is an
equilibrium, cj > 0. Then, a small reduction in ej makes j strictly better off even if j pays for
the entire reduction in output from his own consumption. This improvement in j’s utility
persists even if j must pay a small additional amount to each of the other agents. This proves
that the Rawlsian value of (c, e) can be improved by a unilateral change made by j, by going
to an ex post outcome (c
0
, e
0
) (where e
0 differs from e only in the jth component). That is,
R(c
0
, e
0
) > R(c, e). But note that, as a result, u
j
(c

j
, l

j
) ≥ R(c
0
, e
0
) > R(c, e) = u
j
(cj
, lj) (where the
last equality uses (32)). This contradicts the supposition that (c, e) is an equilibrium.
Finally, if parts (ii) or (iii) of the claim are true, use the same argument as above, if
u
j
c
(cj

j
l
(cj
, lj), or its reverse (increase ej), if u
j
c
(cj

j
l
(cj
, lj), to arrive at
a contradiction.
This completes the proof of the proposition.
Proof of Proposition 3. By our assumptions, the first best is symmetric and has
0 < e
∗ < L.
190 Inequality and Incentives
It follows from the first-order conditions characterizing the first best that
uc(c
∗
, L − e
∗
)Fi(e
∗
, . . . ,e
∗
) = ul
(c
∗
, L − e

),
and moreover, for every e > e
∗ and c ≡
1
n
F(e, . . . ,e),
uc(c, L − e)Fi(e, . . . ,e) ≤ ul
(c, L − e).
Moreover, these hold for all i. It follows from Lemma 1 that no symmetric e ≥ e
∗
can be an
equilibrium of the soft game.
To prove the remainder of the proposition, fix a common utility level u¯ for all but the
first individual, and let u1 denote the utility level of individual 1. Then by applying the
characterization of increased egalitarianism for smooth welfare functions, we see that
(8.60) u¯ ≥ u1 ⇔
V
0
2
V
0
1
≤
V2
V1
where a subscript 1 denotes the marginal social welfare contributed by the first individual’s
utility, and the subscript 2 is the corresponding contribution by the others. Define a “utility
possibility frontier” (given efforts) in the modified soft game by Ψ(u¯,e1,e):
(8.61) Ψ(u¯,e1,e) ≡ u(F(e1,e, ...,e) − (n − 1)c, L − e1)
where c is chosen such that u¯ = u(c, L−e). Ψ is downward sloping and concave with respect
to u¯, by (A.5).
The social planner chooses consumption to maximize V on Ψ. Let us introduce some
notation. We will denote by U1(e1, V) the utility of agent 1 when the action taken by him is
e1, the welfare function is V, the action of the remaining agents is fixed at e (which is not
explicitly carried in the notation), and the planner chooses ex-post consumption optimally.
Likewise, we will denote by U(e1, V) the utility of each of the other agents under exactly the
same state of affairs.19 We make two observations. First,
(8.62) c1(e,e; V) = c(e,e; V) =
1
n
F(e, ...,e)
for any V. Second, it is possible to show, using the concavity of Ψ, the strict quasiconcavity
of V and V
0
, and (36),20 that
(8.63) U1(e1, V) ≥ U(e1, V) ⇔ U1(e1, V) ≥ U1(e1, V
0
) ≥ U(e1, V
0
) ≥ U(e1, V),
when V
0
is at least as egalitarian as V. Moreover, precisely the opposite chain of inequalities
hold on the RHS of (39) if the opposite inequality holds on the LHS of (39).
Let V
0 be at least as egalitarian than V. We claim that
[I] If e ∈ B(e; V), then e ≤ max B(e; V
0
).
19Thus U1(e1, V) = u(c1(e1,e, V), L − e1) and U(e1, V) = u(c(e1,e, V), L − e).
20In fact, this is the only point at which (36) is used in the proof.
Inequality and Incentives 191
Suppose not. Then max B(e; V
0
) < e. So there exists x ∈ [0,e) such that
(8.64) U1(x, V
0
) > U1(e, V
0
).
Because e ∈ B(e, V), it must be the case that
(8.65) U1(x, V) ≤ U1(e, V)
Noting from (38) that U1(e, V) = U1(e, V
0
), we may combine (40) and (41) to obtain
(8.66) U1(x, V) < U1(x, V
0
)
Combine (42) with (39) and the claim immediately following (39). We may deduce that
(8.67) U1(x, V
0
) ≤ U(x, V
0
)
Noting from (38) that U1(e, V
0
) = U(e, V
0
), and combining this observation with (40) and (43),
(8.68) U(x, V
0
) ≥ U1(x, V
0
) > U1(e, V
0
) = U(e, V
0
).
In words, (40) tells us that under V
0
, player 1 is better off choosing x rather than e. At the
same time, (44) tells us that the rest of the players are also better off when player 1 chooses x
instead of e. Thus a vector-inferior collection of efforts (x,e, . . . ,e) instead of (e, . . . ,e) (which
in turn is lower than the first best (e
∗
, . . . ,e
∗
)) leads to a Pareto-improvement. Under our
assumptions, this cannot be.
To see this more formally, note that if x < e < e
∗
, then
(8.69) U1(e, V
0
) = U1(e, V) > Ψ(u¯, x,e)
as long as Ψ(u¯, x,e) ≤ u¯. By putting u¯ = U(x, V
0
), Ψ(u¯, x,e) = U1(x, V
0
), and using (44), we
contradict (45). This completes the proof of Claim [I].
Denote the maximal effort level among all symmetric equilibria under V
0 by e¯. We have
already shown that e¯ < e
∗
. We claim that
[II] max B(e; V
0
) < e for all e ∈ (e¯, L].
To see this, first observe that max B(L, V
0
) ≤ L simply by definition. Now suppose that the
claim is false. Then for some e ∈ (e¯, L], max B(e; V
0
) ≥ e. Moreover, B(., V
0
) is convex-valued
and upperhemicontinuous. But this establishes (using a simple argument analogous to the
Intermediate Value Theorem) the existence of some e
0 > e¯ such that e
0 ∈ B(e
0
; V
0
). Moreover,
a fixed point of B(, ; V
0
) corresponds to a symmetric equilibrium. But this contradicts the
definition of e¯ as the largest symmetric equilibrium effort level under V
0
.
To complete the proof of the proposition, suppose that there exists e ∈ (e¯, L] which belongs to
B(e; V). Then max B(e; V
0
) ≥ e > max B(e; V
0
), where the first inequality follows from Claim
[I], and the second inequality follows from Claim [II]. This is a contradiction, and the proof
is complete.

CHAPTER 9
Notes on Inequality and Growth
Begin with the conceptual links between inequality and growth. I will say a little bit on each.
9.1 Inequality, Capital markets and Growth
We’ve already seen some of this from the earlier lectures. If capital markets are imperfect,
inefficiencies will arise from the fact that some individuals will be unable or unwilling to
take the socially optimal action — the imperfections generate a high or infinite utility cost
of doing so. Whether or not the final outcome is truly inefficient in the sense of dynamic
Pareto-efficiency remains to be seen (Mookherjee and Ray (2003) present some results to this
effect) but it is certainly the case that output is lower than in the first-best.
Just what is needed to translate this sort of result into a lowerrate of growth is unclear. Ideally,
one would have to write down a model that allows for unbounded expansion — say, at some
constant exponential rate — and then examine whether such an expansion rate is affected
by the extent of capital market imperfections.
Such a model will also have to take account of the fixed cost barrier to setting up in a
new occupation or business. This must also “move” with growth, otherwise all credit
market imperfections must ultimately die away. One reason why such barriers may move
in step with growth is that barriers are denominated in human capital (e.g., education for an
occupation or professional staff for a business) which is getting more expensive with growth.
for a related model, see Rigolini (2003).
9.2 Inequality, Public Allocation and Growth
With high inequality, high-income or high-wealth individuals may garner a disproportionate
share of public assets. But doing so may be inefficient from the point of view of future growth.
Here are three examples:
1. Bhagwati and Desai (1956), in their study of Indian planning, suggest that the richer
business interests could easily buy up licences in a corrupt system, leading to the allocation
194 Notes on Inequality and Growth
of valuable resources (such as import quotas) in their direction. New blood didn’t get a
chance. See also Banerjee (1997) on bureaucratic corruption.
2. Sokoloff and Engerman (2000) and Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson (2001) have argued
that an inefficient elite, once installed in power, might attempt to do all it can to keep the
non-elite at bay. As Acemoglu (2005) argues, they might set fiscal policy for three reasons: (i)
to generate revenue off the back of non-elite businesses, (ii) to make it more difficult for such
non-elites to conduct business and this way lower the factor costs of production (e.g., wage
rates) for their own use, and (iii) they might tax non-elites in order to reduce the resources
available for political opposition. This is more a theory of how inequality in the access to
political power (which may in turn stem from economic inequality in the past) might stifle
overall growth.
3. Esteban and Ray (2005) argue that public allocations may be severaly distorted even in the
absence of any corrupt motive. Imagine a world in which governments — just like private
agents — are unsure which direction the economy will, or should take. for instance, they
may not know whether textiles or software or call centers will be the wave of the future. If
the government has a limited supply of “licences” (infrastructual support, subsisdies, tax
breaks, etc.) that it can hand out, then it is rational for them to do so to sectors that lobby
hard. But hard lobbiers can be the outcome of individuals being highly productive (in which
case the government should support the lobby) or people just being rich (in which case there
is nothing to be gained from support). Thus high inequality distorts the lobbying signal,
and reduces the profitability of public allocation.
9.3 Inequality, Redistribution and Growth
The models of this section are diametrically opposed to the models of the previous section. In
the previous argument, high inequality leads to greater amount of rent-seeking, exploitation,
or regressive taxation of the non-elite, which in turn stifles growth through bad allocation.
In contrast, the models of Alesina and Rodrik (1994) and Persson and Tabellini (1994) argue
that high inequality sets up a clamor for redistributive taxation. That redistribution then
ends up being bad for growth because distortionary taxes stifle investment and therefore
growth.
These models are set up in a democratic context, and the median voter theorem is used in
particular. The simplest way to see these models (here I follow Benabou (2000)) is to imagine ´
that income is distributed lognormally — ln y ∼ N(m,∆
2
). Then it is trivial to see that the
log of the median income is precisely m, and also, if µ denotes mean income,
(9.1) m = ln µ −
∆
2
2
.
Suppose that there are only two policies on the table: t = 0 (laissez faire) and t = 1 (with full
lumpsum transfers to everyone; full redistribution). Everyone below the mean income will
prefer full redistribution, so that the degree of support for full redistribution may be proxied
by the value of the cfd evaluated at µ. Recalling (9.1) and using Ψ for the cdf of a standard
Notes on Inequality and Growth 195
normal, we see that the degree of support for redistribution is proportional to
p = ψ

∆
2
/2
∆
!


∆
2

.
Of course this value is bigger than 1/2, but that isn’t necessarily enough for full redistribution
to be passed. After all, as Benabou argues, a large fraction of the individuals at the lower end ´
may not vote at all. For instance, if the π poorest agents don’t vote, then majority requires
that we need a support of (1 − π)/2 counting from the bottom of those individuals that do
vote. Adding back the π, this shows that the identity of the modified median voter is given
by λ, where Ψ(λ) = (1 + π)/2.
However, what appears (seemingly to be) robust is the point that ∂P/∂∆ > 0. That is, the
greater is the amount of inequality in the system, the more widespread is the support for
full redistribution.
What if one augments the model — as one needs to, to connect it with growth — by
presuming that redistributions are costly? Continuing to follow Benabou, the simplest ´
depiction of that cost is one in which every income y is reduced equiproportionately from
y to ye−B
, where B > 0, whenever redistribution takes place. Now the threshold income Y
which will support full redistribution is no longer µ, but is given by
lnY = ln µ − B = m +

Of course, this reduces the level of support for redistribution (relative to the benchmark
case) but what is more relevant is that the sensitivity of demand for redistribution to the
underlying amount of inequality becomes even higher. To see this, observe that

9.4 Inequality, Lack of Redistribution and Growth
Notice that the model of the previous section relies on very different predictions regarding
the effect of redistribution on growth, relative to the arguments that went before. The
Alesina-Rodrik view is that redistribution occurs via distortionary taxation and is therefore
necessarily growth-reducing. But our earlier models argue that redistribution is actually a
1This will be the case anyway is at least a majority of the population is required to achieve redistribution.
196 Notes on Inequality and Growth
good thing, either because it prevents inefficient public allocation, or leads to lower rentseeking,
or permits individuals to find their true economic niche even if capital markets are
imperfect.
This forms the basis of Benabou’s argument, which is simply to entertain the opposite ´
presumption that redistribution is beneficial to growth. Let’s try out this idea on the very
simple exercise presented above. Then instead of y being reduced by redistribution, let us
suppose that it is raised to yeB
, where B > 0. Now the threshold income Y which will support
full redistribution is given by
lnY = ln µ + B = m +

∆

oncea again invoking (9.1). Therefore, the degree of support is given by
p = ψ

But now this affects the demand for redistribution, or rather, the way it reacts to inequality.
To see this, note that

∂∆

B

∆

B

.
Now notice that for small ∆, the change in the support for redistribution (as inequality
increases) is actually negative. The reason is not hard to see. By our assumed independence
of B from ∆, we see that for very small degrees of inequality practically everyone benefits
from redistribution. So there is near-universal support for it. As soon as ∆ climbs, some
of this support goes away as people prefer to retain their own incomes with laissez faire
rather than succumb to full redistribution and undergo an increase in income which will not
compensate them for the original loss. [For very high levels of inequality the relationship
will again turn positive, because most people are now poor and the redistribution can only
benefit them all.]
The interesting thing about this model is that it yields the same inequality-growth tradeoff,
but for exactly the opposite set of reasons from the Alesina-Rodrik-Persson-Tabellini exercise!
In particular, assuming inequality is not too high, an increase in it actually lowers the demand
for redistribution, but lower redistribution is presumed to be bad for growth, so that the
same reduced-form relationship between inequality and growth is obtained.
9.5 Inequality, Conflict and Growth
This is a connection emphasized by Alesina and Perotti (1994), Benhabib and Rustichini
(1996), Svensson (1994) and others. According to this view, high inequality causes political
instability, protests, violent demonstrations, coups, and rioting. These factors in turn make
for low growth.
The literature on this issue is largely empirical (see, e.g., Perotti (1996)). The conceptual
distinctions between inequality and polarization drawn by Esteban and Ray (1994, 1999)
have yet to be usefully applied to instability, though see the recent work of Montalvo and
Reynal-Querol (2005) on ethnic polarization and civil war.
Notes on Inequality and Growth 197
9.6 Inequality, Status and Growth
Suppose that individuals accumulate in part because they derive utility from overtaking
other individuals in the wealth distribution. Then very flat wealth distributions will imply
low densities generally, so that the status effects of investment are likely to be relatively
small at the margin. Conversely, if the distribution is very egalitarian, then small changes in
investment will have large status effects, leading to a higher rate of growth.
This is only half the story, though, because the collective investment decisions made by
everybody will determine the distribution of wealth. In a fully specified equilibrium, the
distribution of wealth and the rate of growth would be jointly determined. the iintuitive
argument thus suggests that there are multiple steady states, but across those states the rate
of growth and the extent of inequality are negatively correlated.
Here is a very simple model that exhibits this effect. Suppose that individual utilities are
given by
A
(y − x)
1−σ
1 − σ
+ Fˆ(x(1 + r)),
where y is initial wealth, x is investment (so y − x is consumption), r is the rate of return to
investment, and Fˆ is the cdf of wealth in the “next generation”.
We study steady states, so suppose that everybody’s wealth grows at some common rate
g (though with different level coefficients). Define, then, a cdf F on the normalized variable
y(t)/(1 + g)
t
. So we may rewrite individual utility above as
A
(y − x)
1−σ
1 − σ

,
where tomrrow’s wealth is now in normalized form. For this to be a steady state, the above
expression must be precisely maximized at x(1+r) = (1+ g)y, or x = (1+ g)y/(1+r). Writing
down the first-order conditions and making this substitution, we see that
Ay−σ

r − g

1 + r

(y),
and this solves out for F over various supports and for various values of g. It is easy to see
that the negative correlation between inequality and growth is borne out in this model.
9.7 Positive Connections Between Inequality and Growth
All the models above suggest that there should be a negative reduced-form relationship
between inequality and growth, though the channels of interaction are very different.
Are there any reasons for believing that inequality might be growth-enhancing in some
situations? There certainly are.
9.7.1 Setup Costs and Extreme Poverty. Imagine a very poor society in which everyone
has low income, too low to incur the setup cost of a potentially profitable business. Then
that business activity will be thoroughly undersupplied. Instead, if wealth is distributed
unequally, some of the the individuals will be able to start the business activity, which
198 Notes on Inequality and Growth
may then have high-growth implications for society as a whole. To be sure, the additional
inequality thus generated may be intolerable, but that is not the issue here. Inequality will
be positively associated with growth.
9.7.2 Uneven Technical Progress, Inequality and Growth. The sources of technical
progress are inherently uneven. Some sector (such as software design, biotechnology, or
financial services) takes off, and there is a frenetic increase in demand for individuals with
these skills. The economy as a whole registers growth, of course. But this growth is highly
concentrated in a relatively small number of sectors. Then, at least over the short to medium
run, inequality will be positively associated with growth. Whether this effect persists in the
longer run will depend on the frequency of such technological “shocks” and the speed at
which subsequent intersectoral adjustments occur.
9.7.3 The Tunnel Effect. The above argument is related somewhat to the “tunnel” effect
described by Hirschman and Rothschild (1973). You are driving through a two-lane tunnel,
where both lanes are in the same direction and, guess what, you get caught in a serious
traffic jam. No car is moving in either lane as far as you can see. You are in the left lane and
your spirits are not exactly high. After a while, however, the cars in the right lane begin to
move. Do you feel better or worse? It depends on how long the right lane has been moving.
At least initially, you might feel that the jam has cleared further ahead and that your turn to
move will come soon.
It has been the experience of several developing economies that the level of inequality in the
distribution of income increases over the initial phases of development. The responses to
such a rise in inequality have been varied, both across economies as well as within the same
economy at different points in time, and they have ranged from an enthusiastic acceptance
of the growth process that accompanied the rise in inequality to violent protests against it in
the form of social and political upheaval. Such differences in the tolerance for inequality may
be explained with the help of the tunnel analogy. The individual’s response to an uneven
improvement will depend on his beliefs as to what it implies for his own prospects. If he
believes such a rise in others’ fortunes is indicative of brighter prospects for himself in the
foreseeable future, then he may make complementary investments, further enhancing the
growth correlations described in the previous section.
Of course, if such an improvement in the welfare of others were to persist for a sustained
period of time, without any improvement in one’s own welfare, initial acceptance of the
improved condition of others would soon give way to anger and frustration, as in the
tunnel example. Moreover, increased inequality may not be tolerated at all if the perceived
link between the growing fortunes of others and the individual’s own welfare is weak or
nonexistent. The greater the extent of segregation in society to begin with, the higher the
possibility of this outcome.
9.7.4 Inequality, Savings and Growth. A last positive connection between inequality and
growth may arise from the effect of inequality on the ability to save, and subsequently on
growth rates. the argument is based on a nonconvexity similar to the setup costs story of
a previous subsection, but the nonconvexity this time arises from minimum consumption
Notes on Inequality and Growth 199
needs. This may cause the savings function to become convex, at least over some range, with
the corollary that higher inequality (in this range of incomes) may be associated with greater
savings rates. The higher savings rates would presumably translate into higher growth rates
via standard argument.
9.7.5 Symmetric HoldUps, Inequality and Growth. the last argument that I present
here, due to Banerjee and Duflo (2003), is different from all the others in that it argues
for a nonmonotonic relationship between inequality and growth. This is analogous to
the assertion of a Kuznets curve, though that curve is concerned with a nonmonotonic
relationship between inequality and per-capita GDP.
Return to the Alesina-Rodrik view, discussed in an earlier section. This view may be
thought of as a situation in which the poor essentially hold up the rich, demanding transfers
in exchange for participating in the growth process where the benefits are flowing directly
to the relatively rich (and so need to be transferred via redistribution). In the Alesina-Rodrik
view, these transfers create distortionary incentives at the margin, thereby slowing down
investment and growth.
Banerjee and Duflo attempt to argue that this sort of holdup may well be symmetric. Just
as the poor may hold up the rich, the rich may hold up the poor. Excessive equality may
create a situation in which the traditionally rich demand compensation for pro-poor growth,
thus degrading that growth via analogous distortionary effects — in just the same way as
redistributive taxation did. This sort of argument suggests an inverse association between
growth and changes in inequality in any direction (the compensating transfers). Banerjee and
Duflo argue that such changes are more likely when inequality is either very high or very
low, and passing to the reduced form, this might suggest an inverse-U relationship between
inequality and growth. The warning: don’t impose linear relationhips in the empirics.
9.8 Empirical Results
The arguments above all rely on different “structural assertions”: inequality clearly works
through a variety of channels on its way to a final impact on growth. An initial exercise,
then, is to simply address the reduced-form question: is inequality positively or negatively
associated with growth? or perhaps more boldly, do initial inequalities retard or encourage
subsequent growth?
What is a good proxy for “initial inequality”? We would like to get a handle on inequalities
in wealth or assets at the beginning of the time period, but data on these are notoriously hard
to come by. One proxy for wealth is inequality of income at that time, but we must recognize
that this is an imperfect proxy. Wealth inequalities at some date are, in a sense, the sum
total of all income inequalities up to that date, and there is no reason why the last of these
inequalities should adequately mirror the history of all its predecessors.
Another proxy for wealth inequality is the inequality in some (relatively) easy-to-observe
asset, such as land. Data on land inequality are easier to obtain, although they are plagued
with problems of their own. Of these problems, the most serious is the distortion created in
countries that are subject to a land reform measure through the imposition of land ceilings.
200 Notes on Inequality and Growth
In such countries land belonging to a single individual or household may be held under a
variety of names, thus creating the illusion of lower inequality than there actually is. Aside
from this problem, land inequality can only be a good proxy for overall inequality in wealth
if agriculture is either significantly important in the economy (for the beginning of the time
period under consideration), or at the very least, has been of significant importance in the
recent past. Fortunately for our purposes, this is a condition that is adequately satisfied by
developing countries.
Alesina and Rodrik (1994) regress per capita income growth over the period 1960–85 on a
variety of independent variables, such as initial per capita income and a measure of initial
human capital. [these are well-known controls: the initial income variable is a proxy for
possible convergence effects, while the human capital variable is used as a proxy for the
endogenous growth effects studies by Uzawa, Lucas and others (see, e.g., Barro (1991)).
Indeed, as far as these variables are considered, Alesina and Rodrik use the same data as
Barro, which makes for cleaner comparison with existing work. In addition, they included
data on initial inequality of income and initial inequality of land.2
Their results indicate a substantial negative relationship between initial inequality and
subsequent growth. Particularly strong is the influence of the Gini coefficient that represents
the initial inequality in land holdings. Their results suggested that an increase in the land
Gini coefficient by 1 standard deviation (which is only an increase of 0.16 in this case) would
decrease subsequent economic growth by as much as 0.8 percentage points per year. [The
Gini coefficient on initial income is only significant at the 10% level.]
These results are unaltered once we allow for structural differences across democratic and
nondemocratic political systems. What is more, the democracy dummy is insignificant both
by itself and when interacted with the Gini coefficient on land. It does appear that political
systems play little role in this relationship, so it is unclear whether a median-voter type
argument is central here (more on that below).
The Alesina-Rodrik findings are confirmed with the use of a more comprehensive data set
in Deininger and Squire (1996). Initial land inequality is more significant than initial income
inequality and stays that way even under several variations on the basic regression exercise
(such as the use of regional dummies). The insignificance of the political system also holds
up under the Deininger-Squire investigation.
The study by Persson and Tabellini (1994) finds slightly different results with somewhat
different specifications. They use the income share of the top quintile as their measure of
inequality. They don’t use land distributions. They carry out two kinds of regressions.
One is a set of historical regressions for nine now-developed countries for which the data
stretches well back.3 The other is a cross-section study, where the independent variable is
the share of the middle class (see also Perotti (1996)).

CHAPTER 10
Notes on Credit Markets
10.1 Introduction
We now turn to a detailed study of credit markets. As explained in my text, most developing
countries have a preponderance of informal credit markets (where the lenders are not formal
financial institutions). We will take the following route.
[1] We begin with a simple study of interest rate variation. We show how — depending on
the presence or absence of collateral — interest rates can be either high or low. Additional
fuel for this sort of variability will also be found when we study interlinkage.
[2] We then turn to a study of quantity restrictions on credit. These may actually take
two forms: credit rationing or loan pushing. The former involves the borrower wanting a
larger loan than what he is given at the going rate of interest. The latter involves wanting a
smaller loan. Finally, note that credit rationing can take the “micro form” that we have just
described or can be of a more “macro variety”: some people are entirely excluded from the
credit market. We will discuss various sources of credit restrictions.
[3] We study the general equilibrium of credit markets. In the analysis so far, we take as
given an outside option for borrowers. To be sure, this outside option will be endogenous in
a larger context. We show that the presence of information regarding past dealings is crucial
in determining these outside options, and indeed, that in some cases the credit market may
entirely collapse.
[4] We study interlinkage and segmentation in credit markets, using largely rural examples.
The idea is to interlink contracts to get around limited collateral, or limited incentives, by
offering a package. We will see that there may be several advantages to doing so. First,
some distortions can be avoided. Second, incentives (such as the threat of termination)
can be made to do double-duty (for, say, credit repayment as well as tenancy). Finally,
in the absence of monetizable collateral (such as unskilled labor or a small piece of land),
interlockers may have a serious edge over non-interlinking moneylenders.
202 Notes on Credit Markets
[5] Finally, we study group lending schemes such as those promoted by the Grameen Bank.
We show that under some conditions, group lending can be used as an effective tool ton
transfer information from borrowers to lenders, thereby making some new contracts feasible
(and profitable) for both lender and borrower.
10.2 A Simple Example
Imagine that loans are forthcoming at an interest rate of 10%, and that there are alternative
projects, each requiring a startup cost of 100,000 pesos. Suppose that the projects are arrayed
in terms of their rate of return, and that there are two of them, with rates of return pegged
at 15% and 20%. If there is no uncertainty about the projects, and all projects pay off fully in
the next time period, this is tantamount to saying that the projects will return gross revenues
of 115,000, and 120,000 pesos respectively.
Observe that in this case there is a perfect coincidence of interests between the bank and the
borrower. The bank wants its 10% back, and would presumably also want the borrower to
take up the optimal project. Given that the borrower wants to make as much money as he
can, there is no reason for him not take up the project with a 20% return. Everyone is happy.
But now let us change matters around a little bit. Suppose that the return to the second
project is uncertain. Thus keep the second project just the same as before, but suppose that
the first project pays off 230,000 pesos with probability 1/2, and nothing with probability
1/2. The expected return is just the same as it was before.
Now let us think about the rankings of these projects from the viewpoints of borrower and
lender. To do this, we shall assume limited liability: if a project fails, the borrower cannot
return any money to the lender: she simply declares bankruptcy. The bank would like to
fund the 20% project, just as before; indeed, more than it did before. This is because the 20%
project pays off its interest (and principal) for sure, while this happens only with probability
1/2 in the case of the 15% project.
What about the borrower’s expected return? Assuming that she is risk-neutral like the bank
is,1
it is 120, 000 − 110, 000 = 10, 000 for the safe project, and it is (1/2)[230, 000 − 110, 000] +
(1/2)0 = 60, 000 for the risky project. Her expected return is much higher under a riskier
project with a lower rate of return! She will therefore try to divert the loan to this project,
and this will make the bank very unhappy.
What went wrong with the market here? What is wrong is that the borrower has limited
liability. In this example, she pays up if all goes well, but if the project fails, he does not
repay anything (she does not get anything either but that is not the main point). In a sense,
this creates an artificial tendency for a borrower to take on too much risk: she benefits from
the project if it goes well, but is cushioned on the downside. The bank would like to prevent
this risk from being taken. Often it cannot.
We will come back to this scenario in more detail later. It will form the basis for theories of
credit rationing.
1A similar example can also be constructed even if the borrower is risk-averse.
Notes on Credit Markets 203
Observe that if the borrower could somehow be made to repay the loan under every
contingency, we would be back to a world that’s equivalent to one of perfect certainty.
The bank would not care what the borrower did with the money, and the borrower would
choose the project with the highest expected rate of return. But who can repay in all (or
most) contingencies? They are the relatively rich borrowers, who can dig into their pockets
to repay even if the project goes badly. We see here, then, in particularly stark form, one
important reason why banks discriminate against poor borrowers.
Thus institutional credit agencies often insist on collateral before advancing a loan. For a
bank which is interested in making money, this is certainly a reasonable thing to do. For
poor peasants, however, this usually makes formal credit an infeasible option. It is not that
they lack collateral to put up. But the collateral is often of a very specific kind. A farmer may
have a small quantity of land that he is willing to mortgage. But a bank may not find this
acceptable collateral, simply because the costs of selling the land in the event of a default is
too high for the bank. Likewise, a landless laborer may be seeking funds to cover a sudden
illness in the family, and pledge his labor as collateral: he would work off the loan. But no
bank will accept labor as collateral.
10.3 Interest Rate Variations
Classical explanation for a high rate of interest in informal credit markets rests on the
lender’s risk hypothesis (Bottomley [1963]). because there is risk, as in the previous section,
and because lending costs need to be covered, the lender tacks on a premium over and above
the opportunity cost of lending. This is a fairly obvious point but it should also be noted that
the point is often wrong! The reason is that the interest rate premium will also systematically
affect borrower behavior. There may be effects working through adverse selection, moral
hazard, or the strategic repayment incentive. In the next section, we begin our study of these
effects with the model of Stiglitz and Weiss (1981).
10.4 Quantity Restrictions
10.4.1 Quantity Restrictions Based on Adverse Selection. We base this on Stiglitz and
Weiss [1981]. Assume away the strategic default problem. But there is involuntary default
coupled with limited liability. To model this, assume that borrowers differ in some parameter
θ measuring riskiness. Project returns R are given by a cdf F(R, θ), and it is assumed that
higher values of θ generate the same means but higher risk. That is, if θ > θ0
, then
(10.1) Z ∞
0
RdF(R, θ) =
Z ∞
0
RdF(R, θ0
),
while
(10.2) Z y
0
F(R, θ)dR ≥
Z y
0
F(R, θ0
)dR
for all y with strict inequality holding for some y.
204 Notes on Credit Markets
Assume that individuals know their own type, while the bank only knows the distribution
of types and cannot recognize the individual riskiness of persons.
The project has a startup cost of B. There is limited liability: each individual has access
to only some fixed collateral C. Now study the repayment decision. If the rate of interest
charged is r, then an individual repays if and only if
(10.3) R − (1 + r)B ≥ −C,
where we are assuming that the bank can seize both the total return R as well as the collateral.
It follows that the borrower’s return (when the realized return is R and the rate of interest is
r) is given by
(10.4) π(R,r) ≡ max{R − (1 + r)B,−C},
which is convex in R, while the lender’s return is
(10.5) ρ(R,r) ≡ min{R + C, B(1 + r)},
which is concave in R.
This permits us to display the expected payoff to a borrower of type θ; it is
(10.6) πˆ(θ,r) ≡
Z ∞
0
π(R,r)dF(R, θ),
while the expected payoff to the lender (when facing a borrower of type θ) is
(10.7) ρˆ(θ,r) ≡
Z ∞
0
ρ(R,r)dF(R, θ).
Now here is the important point. To be sure, the expected payoff to a lender — ρˆ(θ,r) — is
surely decreasing in θ, which is immediately intuitive. But a bit more subtle than this is the
observation that the expected payoff to a borrower — πˆ(θ,r) — is actually increasing in his
own riskiness θ.
To put this another way, define, for each r the threshold θˆ(r) given by
(10.8) πˆ(θˆ(r),r) = 0.
Then the set of types applying for a loan at the rate of interest r is precisely {θ : θ ≥ θˆ(r)},
and θˆ(r) is increasing in r. So increasing r lowers the average quality of loan applicants. It follows
that bank profits will — in general — be nonmonotonic with respect to r.
We may build on these concepts to define — relatively informally — a notion of competitive
equilibrium. To do this, let G stand for the distribution of types. First, define the profit rate
at r by
(10.9) d(r) ≡
1
B[1 − G(θˆ(r))] Z ∞
θˆ(r)
ρˆ(θ,r)dG(θ)
!
,
where ρˆ(θ,r) — which is expected profits when the borrower is of type θ — is defined in
(10.7), and θˆ(r) — the marginal borrower when the interest rate is equal to r — is defined by
(10.8).

Figure 10.1. Credit Rationing: Three Cases
With free entry and exit of banks, the profit rate r will actually turn out to be the deposit rate
that is paid to depositors (which is why we are using the d-notation).
Now for each deposit rate d, there is a supply of deposits Sˆ(d) from potential depositors. Let
us assume that Sˆ(d) is an upward-sloping function. However, the supply of deposits viewed as
a function of r will typically be nonmonotonic simply because d is generally a nonmonotonic
function of r. Define S(r) ≡ Sˆ(d(r)); then this is the effective supply of deposits as a function
of the interest rate charged to borrowers (with the zero-profit condition already built in).
Finally, there is a demand curve for loans D(r), which has the usual downward-sloping
shape. Indeed, in our specific model, everyone who borrows borrows the same amount B,
while the cutoff θˆ(r) gets progressively higher with r. That means that the aggregate demand
has the appropriate shape in r.
Define a competitive equilibrium to be a compact set of interest rates charged by banks such
that no bank wants to deviate from those interest rates given optimal borrower behavior.
206 Notes on Credit Markets
Proposition 10.1. Credit Rationing. (a) Suppose that there is an interest rate r with S(r) = D(r)
such that S(r
0
) < S(r) for all r0 < r. Then there is no equilibrium with credit rationing.
(b) Suppose that for every interest rate r such that D(r) = S(r), there exists r0 < r with S(r
0
) > S(r).
Then there is credit rationing in equilibrium.
Figure 10.1 illustrates. In panel A, there is no crossing of the two curves and so condition
(b) of the proposition holds trivially. In panel B, there is a crossing of the two curves but
condition (b) is satisfied nevertheless. In panel C, condition (a) holds. Thus in cases A and
B, there is credit rationing and in case C there is not.
It is easy to see how the proposition is proved. First assume case (a). Suppose, on the
contrary, that there is an equilibrium with credit rationing. Let r
∗ be the lowest equilibrium
rate; certainly credit is rationed there. Observe that all r
0
in the equilibrium set of interest
rates — call it E — must be equally attractive to depositors, so that
d(r
0
) = d(r
∗
) ≡ d
∗
for all r
0 ∈ E
and that the total supply of deposits divided across all lending banks must be S(r
∗
).
Fix r as given by condition (a).
First suppose that r
∗ > r. Then we have S(r
∗
) < D(r
∗
) < D(r) = S(r), so we conclude that
S(r) > S(r
∗
) and consequently that d(r) > d(r
∗
). But now this equilibrium can be broken by
having a bank deviate to r from r
∗
. Because d(r) > d(r
∗
), it can offer some d
0 > d(r
∗
) and less
than d(r) and so make strictly positive profits. All the borrowers will come to him and all
the depositors as well. This contradicts the assumption that we are at an equilibrium.
Therefore r
∗ < r. But then by (a), we know that S(r) > S(r
∗
), so d(r) > d
∗
, the equilibrium
deposit rate. Now consider a deviation by a bank to charging an interest rate r and a deposit
rate d ∈ (d
∗
, d(r)). All the depositors will come to this bank, so the supply of funds is not a
problem. To see if borrowers will be available, proceed as follows.
The total supply of loans to all banks is S(r
∗
) (depositors get the same rate in all banks
and simply divide themselves up). In particular: add up (or integrate) all depositor funds
available in equilibrium at interest rates r or less: this is not any more than S(r
∗
). On the
other hand, the total demand for loans just by risk types above θˆ(r) is D(r) = S(r) > S(r
∗
).
Thus demand (by these types alone) strictly exceeds total supply at interest rates r or less.
Indeed, because banks that ration credit randomly reject applicants, we see that conditional
on θ > θˆ(r), the distribution of risk types by borrowers is no different from G. These
borrowers will come to our deviating bank, and the bank can make positive profit from
them. We therefore have a contradiction, and the proof of part (a) is complete.
Now assume that the condition in (b) is true. If the conclusion is false, there is an equilibrium
with interest rate r, such that S(r) = D(r). We know that S(r
0
) > S(r) for some r
0 < r. Because
S(r
0
) > S(r), we know that d(r
0
) > d(r). Therefore a bank can deviate by offering r
0 and some
d
0 > d(r) and less than d(r
0
) and still make profits. All the borrowers will come to him and
all the depositors as well. This contradicts the assumption that we are at an equilibrium.
Notes on Credit Markets 207
It still remains to prove that an equilibrium exists with credit rationing in the case where (b)
holds. To this end, define r¯ as the maximizer of d(r) (there could be many but let’s assume
for ease of exposition that there is only one). Let r1 denote the lowest Walrasian outcome
(set it equal to infinity if there is no such outcome). If r¯ is smaller than r1, it is easy to check
that all banks announcing r¯ is an equilibrium, and that it involves credit rationing.
The case r¯ = r1 is not consistent with case (b), so it remains to look at the case in which
r¯ > r1. By condition (b), there is some conditional maximizer r
∗ < r1 of d(r) (subject to
the constraint that r ≤ r1). Now define r2 to be the smallest value of r > r1 such that
d(r2) = d(r
∗
) (such an r2 must exist because r
∗
is a local but not a global maximizer). Because
S(r2) = S(r
∗
) > S(r1) = D(r1) > D(r2), there must be excess supply at r2. Now figure out a
division of banks among the two rates of interest so that all demand is soaked up. It is easy
to check that this forms an equilibrium. Notice that in this equilibrium there must be credit
rationing because there is a multiplicity of interest rates.
Some Observations.
(1) The absence of collateral, is, of course, critical to this sort of reasoning. But even if there
is some collateral (not necessarily enough to cover the entire risk of default), the collateral
can be used in a clever way to achieve some screening. Thus think now of a contract as a
pair (r,C), where r is the rate of interest and C is the collateral that has to be put up in order
to obtain loans at that rate of interest. Then the return to a borrower of type θ is
πˆ(θ,r,C) =
Z ∞
0
max{R − (1 + r)B,−C}dF(R, θ)
= −CF ((1 + r)B − C, θ) +
Z ∞
(1+r)B−C
[R − (1 + r)B]dF(R, θ).
Using this expression, look at the tradeoff between r and C that leaves a borrower of type θ
on the same indifference curve. This is just
dr
dC|πˆ=π¯ = −
∂π/∂ ˆ C
∂π/∂ ˆ r
=
F ((1 + r)B − C, θ)
−B [1 − F ((1 + r)B − C, θ)]
.
Look at the case in which (1+r)B−C is a “low” return; e.g., assume that (1+r)B−C is smaller
than the average value of R and that all distributions are symmetric. In this case, dr
dC|πˆ=π¯
goes up as θ goes up. That is, low-risk types are less willing to accept a given interest rate
increase for a given collateral reduction. This is because they fear less the loss of collateral,
and expect to pay interest in more states of nature.
It follows that if banks are offering (r,C) pairs, separation will be possible. This is the criticism
levied by Bester [AER 1985].
(2) Credit rationing is not inevitable in this model. For instance, if the supply of loanable
funds inccreases, credit rationing disappears. Alternatively, if projects were divisible and
there were constant returns to scale then we would get equal treatment: all applicants would
get a loan, though not as much as they would like — back to micro credit rationing.
208 Notes on Credit Markets
(3) Notice that mean and riskiness are uncorrelated in this model. If the correlation is
positivem then the adverse selection effect would be weaker. Thus this form of credit
rationing relies on specific distributional assumptions.
(4) This form of credit rationing may also not be empirically very plausible if there are
several observationally distinguishable groups (along riskiness lines). Then at most one
group would be rationed (Riley [AER 1987]).
10.4.2 Quantity Restrictions Based on Moral Hazard.
10.4.2.1 Moral Hazard in Project Choice Let’s begin with a variant of the Stiglitz-Weiss
model in which there is unobserved project choice (and therefore moral hazard) on the part
of the borrower. Say that there are borrowers with various levels of (observable and seizable)
collateral C. There is also a whole range of projects indexed by θ as before, but this time no
particular θ is attached to any borrower; they all choose from this set of projects.
Assume that project returns are binary for every θ. Specifically, suppose that the return is θ
with probability p(θ), and is 0 with probability 1 − p(θ). The gross expected value of project
θ is, then, θp(θ). We suppose without loss of generality that p(θ) falls with θ; if this did not
happen over some range, those projects would be never be chosen anyway.
Assume, just as before, that each project requires the same loan size of B.
Now a borrower who puts down collateral C and faces a rate of interest r will choose θ to
maximize
p(θ) [θ − B(1 + r)] −

1 − p(θ)

C,
where I assuming that the best θ exceeds B(1+r), otherwise the borrower would not borrow
at all.
This determines θ(C,r) as a function of C and r; assume that the maximized value is unique
(it is easy to give suficient conditions for this to happen).
Observe that θ(C,r) is decreasing in C and increasing in r: more collateral induces safety; higher
interest rates induce risk.
To prove this, define Z = B(1 + r) − C, and convince yourself that the borrower maximizes
p(θ)[θ − Z]
by choosing θ. Let Z1 > Z2 and θ1 and θ2 be the corresponding maxima. Then by the
assumed uniqueness of the maximum,
p(θ1)[θ1 − Z1] > p(θ2)[θ2 − Z1],
while
p(θ2)[θ2 − Z2] > p(θ1)[θ1 − Z2].
Adding these two inequalities, we can conclude that

p(θ1) − p(θ2)

(Z1 − Z2) < 0.
Because p(θ) is declining, we can conclude that θ is increasing in Z, which completes the
proof.
Notes on Credit Markets 209
Now look at a person with C = 0. Notice that as long as
max
r
p(θ(0,r))(1 + r) < 1 + r¯
where r¯ is the opportunity rate of return to funds, such people will be completely rationed
out, and all collaterals that are small enough will, by continuity, be completely rationed out
as well. There is no rate of interest at which a loan will be forthcoming to them.
So moral hazard also generally leads to credit rationing. Under some conditions, it is also
possible to predict what happens to the interest rate for different sizes of collateral. For
instance, under competitive lending, it must be the case that
p(θ(C,r))B(1 + r) + [1 − p(θ(C,r))]C = B[1 + r¯].
raiseC; then by our previous result θ comes down so that p(θ) goes up. Obviously, B(1+r) > C
so in summary, the left hand side of the equality above must go up. To restore equality, the
interest rate r must fall. Therefore under competition the interest rate on loans moves
inversely with collateral.
With monopolistic lending, matters are not so clear, which makes sense. A monopolistic
lender may well take advantage of a highly collateralized (and therefore safe) borrower to
push up the interest rate. I leave it to you to examine whether r must rise with C over some
stretch of collaterals.
10.4.2.2 Moral Hazard in Effort A debt overhang refers to a state of affairs in which an
ongoing debt reduces the effort taken by the borrower to ensure a good output. This is the
moral hazard problem. It is unclear whether one thinks of this as an instance of strategic or
involuntary default — both elements are present.
In simplest terms, think of a consumption smoothing model. Let wealth be w0 today, while
today it has value w1 with probability p and 0 otherwise. Assume that w1 > w0. If L
is borrowed today and then R repaid tomorrow (only in the good state, of course), then
expected utility is given by
(10.10) u(w0 + L) + δpu(w1 − R),
where we have normalized u(0) to 0.
The lender gets an expected value of
(10.11) −L + δpR,
where this formulation presumes that the risk-free rate of interest is given by δ = 1/(1 + r).
Now imagine that p is exogenous and that we are trying to find a Pareto-optimal allocation.
That is, maximize (10.11) while respecting some lower bound on the value in (10.10). It is
easy to see that we must set
(10.12) w1 − R = w0 + L,
so that there is perfect consumption smoothing (over those states that permit it). The exact
values of R and L cannot be pinned down until we know the particular Pareto-optimal point
210 Notes on Credit Markets
that we are trying to characterize. For instance, if lenders operate in a competitive market
with free entry, then lender’s profits will be driven to zero, so that, by (10.11),
(10.13) R =
1
δp
L,
which is just another way of saying that the rate of interest is driven down to the risk-adjusted
value 1
δp
− 1.
In this case, equations (10.12) and (10.13) fully pin down the first best credit scheme.
Now suppose that the probability of success can be influenced by the deliberate application
of effort. To keep things very simple, we shall suppose that there just two possible levels
of effort, 0 and 1. The corresponding probabilities of success are p(0) and p(1) respectively,
where p(0) < p(1). The cost of setting effort equal to zero is 0, while the cost of setting effort
equal to 1 is D.
Thus, ex post, imagine that there is an overhang of R and the borrower is deciding on effort
input. He will choose the high level of effort if
[p(1) − p(0)]u(w1 − R) ≥ D,
or equivalently, if
(10.14) R ≤ R¯ ≡ w1 − h

D
p(1) − p(0) !
,
where h is just the inverse function of u.
Now if R¯ is higher than the first-best equilibrium, there is no problem. The first-best outcome
still obtains.
On the other hand, there may be credit rationing especially if wealth is low or if D is high.
In that case, one needs to compare the rationed contract with another possibility in which
e = 0 and loans are advanced at the higher competitive rate 1
δp(0) − 1. We would then expect
that no credit rationing would occur both among the very poor and the very wealthy, while
credit rationing would be observed for borrowers with intermediate levels of wealth.
We can easily extend these to cohesive notions of equilibrium (with free entry on the part of
lenders). Notice that such equilibria would be second-best Pareto optimal: the government
cannot do better if it must also repect the moral hazard constraint of the borrower.
However, this assumes that lenders can offer exclusive contracts. If exclusivity cannot be
enforced, then these equilibria will break down.
To see this, notice that at the credit-rationed equilibrium, a borrower is under rationed even
relative to the higher interest rate 1
δp(0) −1. The way to see this is to note that the loan repayment
amount with perfect insurance under the higher interest rate must exceed its counterpart
under the lower interest rate. Because this counterpart, in turn, exceeds the threshold R¯ , it
follows that the credit-rationed borrower would love to take some additional loan (small
enough) under the higher interest rate 1
δp(0) − 1 (or even at a rate a little higher than that).
Notes on Credit Markets 211
If a lender supplies this loan — which he will if exclusivity cannot be monitored — then
this creates a negative externality on the “incumbent lender”, and second-best optimality (at
least relative to an ideal in which the government can enforce exclusivity) will break down.
10.4.3 Quantity Restrictions Based on the Default Problem. Consider the following
model of working capital. Output simply depends on the amount of loan (L) taken via
the function F(L) satisfying standard properties. A borrower is engaged in a repeated
relationship with a lender, but if he leaves the relationship he has an outside option given
by a normalized value of v.
Consider only stationary contracts (L,R) for the moment (later, we explore the nonstationary
case). Then what is the incentive constraint for the borrower? It is given by the restriction:
(1 − δ)F(L) + δv ≤ F(L) − R,
or, rearranging:
(10.15) δF(L) − R ≥ δv.
Now suppose that given these outside options, the lender has all the bargaining power.
Suppose, more over, that the opportunity interest rate of funds lent out is r. Then he
maximizes his payoff
R − (1 + r)L
by choice of (L,R), and subject to the incentive constraint (10.15).
It is easy to see, either by constructing the Lagrangean and differentiating, or drawing a
diagram, that the solution involves the granting of a loan of size L˜, where this solves the
equation
(10.16) δF
0
(L˜) = 1 + r,
and then asking for a repayment R˜ satisfying
(10.17) δF(L˜) − R˜ = δv.
Now let us ask ourselves: is there credit rationing or loan pushing at this solution? Notice,
to begin with, that L˜ is surely less than L
∗
, which solves F
0
(L
∗
) = 1 + r and which would
surely have been the optimal amount barring default considerations. So there is clearly a
restruiction of the loan relative to this value. But this does not say anything a priori about
whether there is credit rationing or loan pushing. To settle this we will have to look at the
implict rate of interest on the loan, which is r˜ ≡
R˜
L˜ − 1.
The question is: would the borrower have preferred to borrow more or borrow less at this
rate of interest r˜?
The answer to this question depends on the discount factor of the borrower. First note that
a solution to the maximization problem exists if and only if
(10.18) max
L≥0
[F(L) −
1 + r
δ
L] ≥ v.
Suppose that we are at (or very close to) the existence borderline. In that case,
R˜ ' (1 + r)L˜,
212 Notes on Credit Markets
which is just another way of saying that
r˜ ' r.
At the same time, L˜ < L
∗
. So obviously for low discount factors we have credit rationing
(relative to the implicit or explict rate of interest on the loan).
On the other hand, suppose that (10.18) holds for some threshold value of δ but that — in
any case — δ is very close to one. Then the structure of the optimal contract — see (10.16) —
tells us that
L˜ ' L
∗
,
while
R˜ > (1 + r)L˜.
[To understand this last inequality, recall from the optimality condition (10.17) that R˜ =
δF(L˜) − δv > (1 + r)L˜, where the strict inequality holds because (10.18) must hold strictly
when δ is close enough to one.]
In other words, for δ sufficiently close to unity there must be loan pushing.
It turns out that loan pushing is a property of situations in which the creditor has some
bargaining power and the borrower is sufficiently patient. For if we give the borrower all
the bargaining power in this model, then loan pushing can never occur. To see this, consider
the borrower’s problem when he has all the bargaining power: lender profits must be zero,
so the borrower maximizes
(10.19) F(L) − (1 + r)L
subject to his own incentive constraint (10.15), which we may rewrite here as
(10.20) δF(L) − (1 + r)L ≥ δv.
Again, consider two cases. First, suppose that
(10.21) δF(L
∗
) − (1 + r)L
∗ ≥ δv.
In this case the borrower must choose the unrestricted maximum L
∗
. Then there are no
quantity restrictions. Otherwise
(10.22) δF(L
∗
) − (1 + r)L
∗ < δv.
But of course, it is still possible that (10.18) holds. On this assumption, the borrower will
choose the loan size L(δ), which is the maximum loan size L such that (10.20) holds. In this
case there will be credit rationing.
10.5 Information and Equilibrium in Credit Markets
The main point of this section is to argue, along with Ghosh and Ray [1996, 1998], that an
informational breakdown in informal credit markets is likely in the process of development,
and that this has implications for the structure of contracts, we well as for the very existence
of such markets.
Consider v, the outside option. Where does it come from? Presumably, this is the expected
(present-value) payoff conditional on the termination of an ongoing bilateral relationship.
Notes on Credit Markets 213
The reason for this termination will typically matter. For instance, if a borrower has defaulted
and this is the cause of termination, then if this matter becomes known to new lenders they
may not be willing to advance a loan.2
Thus, v is some combination of punishment as well as the going equilibrium contract. There
are obviously many ways to model this. Let us take a particularly simple version, where
we assume that the lending market is competitive and borrowers have all the bargaining
power. To review the usual stuff, recall that given the outside option v and the opportunity
rate of interest r facing lenders, borrrowers maximize
(10.23) F(L) − (1 + r)L
subject to the incentive constraint
(10.24) F(L) −
1 + r
δ
L ≥ v,
where δ, it will be recalled, is the discount factor.
It is obvious, then, that in any solution L to the above problem, L must be at least as large as
the value Lˆ that maximizes the LHS of the incentive constraint (10.24).
Let the optimum value of (10.23) be given by w (we emphasize that w depends on v).
Now let us try to endogenize v. Suppose that when a borrower defaults, he approaches a
lender every period thereafter. The lender checks on the borrower’s past and uncovers the
default with probability p. In that case, the lender refuses the loan, and the borrower moves
to the next period where exactly the same story repeats itself. If, on the other hand, the
lender fails to uncover the default, the borrower enters into a new credit relationship with
the lender. But in that case, the present value of the contract is w.
It follows that v — the expected value of the outside option — is given by
(10.25) v = pδv + (1 − p)w =
1 − p
1 − δp
w.
Then we can write v = (1 − ρ)w, where
(10.26) ρ ≡
p(1 − δ)
1 − δp
can be viewed as the scarring factor. Notice that if p gets very close to one, so that a default
is always recognized, then the scarring factor converges to one as well. On the other hand,
for any p strictly between zero and one, the scarring factor goes to zero as δ goes to unity.
Proposition 10.2. Define
(10.27) ρ
∗ ≡
(1 + r)(1 − δ)Lˆ /δ
F(Lˆ) − (1 + r)Lˆ
,
2Why new lenders may be unwilling to give a loan to past defaulters is actually a matter requiring some serious
study. For instance, can one sustain this sort of outcome without any incomplete information at all on the part
of the borrower? If there are a lot of borrowers and a lender can always find a fresh borrower, then this sort
of assumption is relatively easy to maintain. Otherwise the equilibrium supporting this sort of penalty may be
surprisingly convoluted — in the presence of complete information, at least.

L.
Then a competitive equilibrium exists if and only if ρ ≥ ρ
∗
.
Thus a certain minimum degree of scarring is needed before a competitive equilibrium can
be guaranteed. This is intuitive. If scarring did not exist, individuals could always renege
on loans and dive back into an anonymous pool.
Notice by the way that ρ

where the first weak inequality in the string above uses the fact that L ≥ Lˆ. But now we have
a contradiction to the incentive constraint (10.24).
Sufficiency. Conversely, assume that ρ ≥ ρ
∗
. Define wˆ ≡ F(Lˆ) − (1 + r)Lˆ.
For each w ≥ wˆ define v ≡ (1 − ρ)w. First, consider vˆ = (1 − ρ)wˆ. Notice that for v = vˆ, the
maximization problem described by (10.23) and (10.24) has a feasible solution. For
F(Lˆ) −

(1 + r)(1 − δ)

Lˆ

≥ wˆ(1 − ρ) = vˆ.
Now, for each w ≥ wˆ, form the corresponding v (as we just did for wˆ) and keep noting the
borrower’s maximal w relative to that v. Call this mapping h(w). Notice that there exists
w¯ ≥ wˆ such that when we put v¯ = (1 − ρ)w¯,
F(Lˆ) −
1 + r
δ
Lˆ = v¯.
Put another way, Lˆ is the only solution satisfying the incentive constraint when the outside
option is v¯. That means the borrower’s maximum w = h(w¯) at this point is simply wˆ. So we
Notes on Credit Markets 215
have found two points wˆ and w¯ such that wˆ ≤ w¯ and
h(wˆ) ≥ wˆ and h(w¯) = wˆ ≤ w¯.
Noticing that h is continuous is between, we have proved existence.
Thus is the scarring rate is too low, equilibrium falls apart. What might restore equilibrium
and still permit credit markets to function?
10.5.1 Credit Macro-Rationing. The first possibility is credit rationing at some macroeconomic
level. To see how this fits, suppose that a past defaulter may be excluded from future
loan dealings for two distinct reasons:
Targeted Exclusion. The defaulter’s nasty behavior is unveiled bya new lender (which
happens with probability p), and he is refused a loan. This is already present in the model
above and we add nothing here.
Anonymous Exclusion. Whether or not a potential borrower has actually defaulted in the
past, he may face difficulty in getting a loan. This is macro-rationing of credit, analogous
to the equilibrium unempoloyment rate in Shapiro and Stiglitz [1984]. Let us denote the
probability of such exclusion (in any period) by q. Notice that to build a coherent model in
which q > 0, we really have to answer the question of why the market is not clearing — why
lenders do not pounce upon available borrowers and ply them with loans. [Note, by the
way, that the same issues come up when we attempt to explain p > 0 without taking recourse
to any reputational factors.] One coherent model is given by the case in which lenders make
zero expected profits, so that they are always indifferent between lending and not lending.
The main point is that anonymous exclusion may be an equilibrium-restoring device. To
see this, let us calculate ρ, the effective scarring factor, when there is both targeted and
anonymous exclusion. The corresponding equation is
(10.28) ρ ≡
π(1 − δ)
1 − δπ
where π, now, is the overall probability of being excluded at any date. It is easy to see that
(10.29) π = 1 − (1 − p)(1 − q).
Now notice that irrespective of the value of p, q can always adjust to guarantee that an
equilibrium exists. [To be sure, the determination of q becomes an interesting question, but
this is beyond the scope of the present exercise.]
10.5.2 Reputational Effects: Starting Small.
10.5.3 Nonstationary Contracts: Starting Small.

CHAPTER 11
Interlinked Contracts
We return to the question of borrower-lender matching. The data reveal that borrowers and
lenders are ususally engaged in “compatible” occupations: the landlord lends to his tenant,
the trader lends to farmers who supply to him, and so on. Moreover, one observes that the
contacts are ofen interlinked with other contracts. A loan is often offered as part of a tenancy
arrangement. A trader may advance loans to the farmers who supply to him. What explains
these interlinked contracts?
[1] Interlinkage as Assurance. Suppose that the lender’s principal occupation involves
increasing returns to scale. Trading is the best example, because the trader must incur large
fixed costs to transport the produce. Faced with uncertainty regarding the quantity of output
he can transport to the market during harvest time, he might find it in his interest to “tie up”
some farmers by giving them loans in exchange for the promise of output sales to him.
[2] Interlinkage as Enforcement. Interlinked relationships are sometimes useful for
preventing strategic default as well. To see this, it will be useful to recall two stories with very
similar features. First, think about the model of strategic default that we considered earlier.
We noticed that to prevent default, the moneylender cannot drive down the borrower to his
participation constraint. To avoid default, a certain surplus over the next best option had to
be provided. The borrower will trades off the loss in this surplus in future dates with the
one-time gain to be had from default.
Second, notice that a very similar story can be constructed for a tenancy contract (and we
will do that in the last section of this course). A tenancy contract can be supplemented
by intertemporal incentives which promise to renew the contract in the case of satisfactory
performance, and end it otherwise. This firing threat can only be a threat, however, if the
tenant earns by being fired than he does with his current (and long-term) landlord. Thus
the permanent contract must be in the nature of a carrot, which can be used as a stick in the
event of noncompliance with the contract.
The simple observation is that with an interlinked relationship, a single carrot can be used as
two sticks, as long as deviations cannot be carried outsimultaneously on both fronts. Combine
the two scenarios. For instance, suppose that a landlord has a tenant to whom he offers a
rental contract with threat of eviction in case the output is lower than some pre-understood
218 Interlinked Contracts
minimum. Such a contract must, for the same reasons considered in the stories above, carry
with it a certain surplus. Now it is easy to see that a loan to the tenant can be supported by an
“interlinked threat”: if the loan is not repaid, then the tenancy will be removed. The surplus
in the tenancy thus serves a twin role. It assures the provision of appropriate effort in the
tenancy contract, while at the same time it doubles as an incentive to repay loans. In this
sense, the landlord is at a distinct advantage in advancing credit to his tenant, because he
has at his disposal a pre-existing instrument of repayment. In contrast, a pure moneylender
lending to the same tenant must offer additional incentives for repayment through the credit
contract itself.
[3] Interlinkage and Nonmarketable Collateral. We’ve already talked about the possible
nonmarketability of collateral such as labor or even land. This might create what looks
like interlinked contracts, because it will be very natural that someone who has use for the
borrower’s collateral will be lending to him. But one should be careful to note that this — in
itself — does not guarantee that the contract itself will be interlinked. But it does go some
way towards explaining market segmentation.
[4]Interlinkages and Distortions. The example that follows is based on Gangopadhyay
and Sengupta [OEP, 1987].
Suppose that a crop is grown with market price p. Farmers can produce the crop on their
own and market it through a trader, but with working capital they can produce an even
larger amount. One way to describe this is to assume that the famer has access to an indirect
production function F(L) defined on the amount borrowed, which is L. Think of F(0) as the
total output produced in the absence of working capital, assume that there are no other costs
of production, and define A ≡ pF(0). This is his outside option.
Now suppose that a trader has access to funds at some opportunity rate of interest i, and
can lend it to the farmer. In principle he can offer a contract of the form (q,r), where q is the
price at which he can pledge to buy output from the farmer and r is the rate of interest at
which he offers the loan.
If the trader offers a simple contract in which only some rate of interest r is specified, then
the farmer will choose L to maximize
F(L) − (1 + r)L,
yielding some return to the farmer — call it B. Note that B > A if, for instance, F
0
(0) > 1 + r.
It will also yield a return C to the trader, where
C = (r − i)L(r),
(L(r) being the optimal loan taken by the farmer at the rate of interest r).
To compare the surplus generated — which is B+C — with the maximal total surplus that can
be generated, introduce a fictional business in which the trader and the farmer are actually
the same entity. Then this joint entity will choose L
∗
to maximize
F(L) − (1 + i)L.
Interlinked Contracts 219
Let S be the maximal value. This is the total surplus available in the system. It is easy to see
that for any r > i, S > B + C. This is the distortion: the loan size L(r) is distorted away from
L
∗ = L(i).
However, there is an interlinked contract which regains full efficiency, and the trader will
have the incentive to offer it. Define (q
∗
,r
∗
) such that
(11.1) q
∗
/p = (1 + r
∗
)/(1 + i),
and such that
(11.2) max
L
q
∗F(L) − (1 + r
∗
)L = A.
It is easy to see that there is a unique contract satisfying these two properties. It must involve
q
∗ < p and r
∗ < i. That is, the loan is advanced at a rate below the opportunity cost of funds
for the trader, while the surplus from the loan is removed in the form of a lower output
price.
This contract must maximize trader profits. By (11.1), the farmer will choose a loan size
exactly equal to L
∗
, so this is the undistorted amount. By (11.2), the farmer is given just
enough so that he will participate in the contract. So the trader will remove S − A, which is
the highest that he can possibly get.
It is in this sense that interlinkage can remove distortions.
While this sort of argument has insight, it needs to be refined. For instance, there are other,
noninterlinked contracts that are also efficient in this case. But these must be nonlinear
contracts. For instance, consider the forcing contract under which the trader says:
Either borrow L
∗ at a high rate of interest R such that pF(L
∗
) − (1 + R)L
∗ = A, or don’t borrow
anything at all.
This will also implement the first best. In other words, the interlinkage result may not be
robust to nonlinear contracts.
[5] The interlocker’s Edge? Of course, notice that this sort of forcing contract only makes
sense when there is no asymmetric information. The lender has to be able to calcuate the
first-best loan. However, as Ray and Sengupta [1989] argue, there are several situations in
which an interlocker has really no intrinsic advantage over a pure moneylender. To see this,
look at the following cases.
Case 1. The pure moneylender cannot offer arbitrary nonlinear contracts. In this case, as we
have seen in the discussion above, the interlocker has an advantage.
Case 2. The interlocker faces better terms in the market where he is active. In this case he
can do better than the pure moneylender, and this pure gain may be transformed into much
larger profits if there are epsilon costs of entry.
Consider the following example. Suppose that a laborer needs a loan to tide over the slack
season. In the peak season he may be employed with probability p or unemployed with
probability 1 − p. The moneylender cannot do anything about the laborer’s probability of
220 Interlinked Contracts
employment but a large landowner who will hire labor in the peak season certainly can.
This gives him the edge.
Case 3. Differential observability. Suppose a loan is given in the first period. In the second
period, there is a standard principal-agent problem: the output is produced and the loan
repaid. A fixed interest contract is not optimal then for the same reason that a fixed rent
contract is not generally optimal. Lender can do better if he can observe output and condition
repayments on these observations.
Case 4. Extend the trader-lender model so that the final output price is uncertain. If
the lender is risk-neutral and the tenant is risk-averse, then the trader can provide perfect
insurance by buying the crop at a fixed price. There is no need (for the trader) to observe the
final price of the output. But if the moneylender cannot observe this final output, he cannot
offer an equivalent contract.
Proposition 11.1. If Cases 1–4 do not hold, then interlinking and pure moneylending yield the same
returns.
Proof. See Ray and Sengupta [1989].
CHAPTER 12
Credit Policy
12.1 Group Lending
Begin with an adverse selection model along the lines considered by Stiglitz and Weiss, but
in even more simplified form (we base this on Ghatak [1999]). There are a continuum of
borrowers each seeking a unit loan. The repayment on the loan (principal plus interest) is
denoted by r. The opportunity cost of making the loan is denoted by i.
We consider only two possible outcomes: full repayment and no repayment. Borrowers are
indexed by their probabilities of repayment, which we denote by p, and the amount that
they repay conditional on success, which we denote by R. Without loss of generality we let
p index borrower type and we assume that pR(p) is a constant, R, for each type of borrower.
Borrowers are distributed with support on the interval [q, 1], where q > 0, and with density
g on this support.
Each borrower has an outside option of u, and everybody is assumed to be risk-neutral.
If we assume that
(12.1) R > i + u,
then it is first-best optimal to lend to all borrowers. But let us see how the equilibrium
works out. Assume that there is a competitive market among lenders, so that we impose
the zero-profit condition on them.
Suppose that the going rate of repayment is r. Then who will borrow? Only those types p
such that p ≤ p(r), where p(r) is given by the equation
R − p(r)r = u,
or
(12.2) p(r) =
R − u
r
.
That is, the borrower pool will lie in the interval (q, p(r)]. It follows that the zero-profit
equilibrium condition for the lender is
(12.3) a(r)r − i = 0,
222 Credit Policy
where
(12.4) a(r) ≡
R p(r)
q
sg(s)ds
G(p(r)) .
where G is the cdf.
Proposition 12.1. If (12.1) holds, then there is r such that a(r)r − i = 0. Moreover, there is a unique
equilibrium (generically) given by the smallest of the solutions (in r) to this zero-profit equation.
Proof. Begin by looking at r = i. In that case, we see that even the type p = 1 will benefit by
taking a loan because of (12.1). It follows that p(i) = 1. But nevertheless, given that there is
a spread of borrowers, a(i) < 1. Therefore
(12.5) a(i)i − i < 0.
Now take r to the largest possible value which is consistent with the worst type borrower
borrowing; call this value ρ. Then
lim inf
r→ρ
ra(r) = rlim inf
r→ρ
R p(r)
q
sg(s)ds
G(p(r)) .
Notice that both numerator and denominator of this expression go to zero as r → ρ. So, using
L’Hospital’s Rule, we may conclude (taking derivatives in both numerator and denominator
above) that
lim inf
r→ρ
ra(r) = ρ lim inf
p→q
pg(p)
g(p)
= ρq = R − u > i,
using (12.1) again. Consequently
(12.6) lim inf
r→ρ
a(r)r − i > 0.
Noting that a(r)r is continuous, we can conclude from (12.5) and (12.6) that there exists
r ∈ (i, ρ) such that a(r)r − i = 0. Notice that there is a compact set of such solutions, so that a
minimum — call it r
∗ — is well-defined.
Notice that an equilibrium must belong to the set of zero-solutions. To see this, observe that
generically there exists an interval of the form (r
∗
,R
∗+) such that a(r)r−i > 0 in this interval.1
Any bank can cut any other announcement to this value, get all the first pick at borrowers,
and make positive profits. So the equilibrium must involve a common announcement of r
∗
.
Now we turn to the possibility of group lending. To begin with, simply look at lending
to groups of two (without worrying about whether this can be an equilibrium or not). A
contract is now a pair (r, c), such that r is the payment a borrower makes if he is successful
1Why is this generic? To see this, observe that the first zero of the function a(r)r − i must be a cut from “below”,
because a(i)i − i < 0. generically, it must be a cut in which case the condition in the main text is satisfied. There
is a nongeneric possibility that the first zero is a point of tangency between the a(r)r − i line and the horizontal
axis.
Credit Policy 223
and c is an extra payment that he makes if he is successful but his partner is not. So the
expected return to a type p when he is paired with a type p
0
is
(12.7) π(p, p
0
) ≡ pp0
[R(p) − r] + p(1 − p
0
)[R(p) − r − c] = [R − rp] − p(1 − p
0
)c.
Of course, π2(p, p
0
) > 0: everybody wants a safer partner. But the important point is that
π12(p, p
0
) > 0 as well: the safer person benefits more from a safer partner:
π2(p, p
0
) = pc,
π12(p, p
0
) = c.
This means that in any group formation games, the matching of unqeual types can never be
a core outcome, because
(12.8) π(p, p) + π(p
0
, p
0
) > π(p, p
0
) + π(p
0
, p).
To see this, simply use (12.7) and grind away at the algebra — it’s easy. Thus group lending
gives rise to positive assortative matching.
Now we can study how joint liability contracts such as these may be used to overthrow
the individual liability equilibrium. Assuming — using the above argument — that similar
types will pair together, we may conclude that the return to a p-pair from a contract (r, c) is
(12.9) π
∗
(p) ≡ [R − rp] − p(1 − p)c.
Now consider a variation of (r, c) around the single liability contract (r
∗
, 0) such that r < r
∗
,
c > 0, and which leaves the marginal type (under the old equilibrium) — p(r
∗
) unaffected.
Writing p
∗ = p(r
∗
), this means (using (12.9)) that
∆(p
∗
) ≡ −p
∗
dr − p
∗
(1 − p
∗
)dc = 0.
From this expression, notice that if p < p
∗
, then (recalling that dr < 0 and dc > 0) ∆(p) < 0
while if p > p
∗
then ∆(p) > 0 by the same token.
With this in mind, shift things a little bit so that ∆(p
∗
) > 0 but ∆(p) < 0 if p ≤ p
∗ − . Then
all types p below this threshold would still go to the single liability contract. Thus a tiny
change in the terms of the contract to a joint liability contract by one lender will completely
change the mix of the applaicants that he gets, generating positive profits for him. It is in
this way that an individual liability equilibrium is wiped out by the introduction of joint
liability contracts.

12.1.1 An Informal Extension to Entrepreneurship. To illustrate this last point, let us
redo and extend the two-skills example with private firms. What follows is just an informal
discussion with Suppose that production requires a setup cost S that must be borne up
front. Suppose that there are two wealth levels in the society, 0 and W (which exceed S).
Assume, moreoever, that there are just two productivity levels, λ = 0 and λ = 1, and that the
production function is given by λF(L), where L is the amount of labor hired. Finally, assume
that the high-productivity type can cover the setup cost of production.
In this economy, production will be carried out by those individuals for whom wealth equals
W and λ = 1. Let a be the fraction of such people. Note the following:
224 Credit Policy
(i) People with low wealth who are productive will not be able to bear the setup cost, and
this will be a loss to society. An increase in inequality that puts more people below the
threshold needed to finance setup costs will result in greater economic loss at the aggregate
level.
(ii) Assuming that the correlation between productivity and wealth is nonnegative, we see
that the loss is greatest when the correlation is zero (this is when a assumes its highest value).
The loss is minimal when productive types are only to be found among the wealthy (this
may be true if wealth is an indicator of past productivity, and if productivity exhibits high
serial correlation, both of which are strong assumptions).
(iii) The positive association between equality and greater efficiency depends critically on
the average wealth level in the society. If the average wealth level is high, then an increase
in equality puts more people above the threshold S needed to start up production. On
the other hand, if the average wealth level is low, then an increase in equality may throw
more individuals under the threshold, creating an even greater loss of efficiency. Thus poor
societies may be caught in a double-bind: where the (intrinsic) need for redistribution is
higher, the functional implications may be negative.
(iv) Denote the demand curve for labor by L(ν) (where the demand curve is obviously only
defined for the high types and where ν stands for the market wage). Then an increase in
inequality (assuming that we are not in the low average wealth trap) will lower a and move
the aggregate demand curve aL(ν) to the left. [So will a lowering of a caused by reduced
correlation between productivity and wealth.] If the wage rate is endogenous, it will go
down.
(v) This effect is heightened if those who cannot afford the setup costs to run a business
must join the labor force — the supply curve of labor shifts to the right at the same time
that the demand curve for labor shifts to the left. Effects (iv) and (v) are precisely the sort
of interactive implications highlighted by authors such as Banerjee and Newman [1993].
Inequality affects macroeconomic variables, such as the level of employment or the wage
rate.
(vi) Continuing this theme, we see that had we posited a slightly more complex model with a
continuum of productivity types, then productivity types which are supposed to be inactive
at the first best would enter production. This is because the equilibrium wage rate is low
relative to the first best, so that certain productivity types which would have not covered
the setup cost at the first best are now able to do so at the equilibrium wage rate. [These are
wealthy people as well.]
(vii) Adopting a slight political-economy perspective, we can see why coalitions of producers
might now want to oppose policies that provide better credit to the poor, even though these
policies may not be overtly redistributive.

Nature and Scope of Economics
Introduction
Economics is a social science which deals with human wants and their
satisfaction. It is mainly concerned with the way in which a society chooses to employ
its scarce resources which have alternative uses, for the production of goods for
present and future consumption.
Political economy is another name for economics. “Polis” in Greek means a
State. The early writers used the term “Political Economy” for the management of the
State. A person who runs a family is expected to make the best use of the income
of the household. Similarly, the State is expected to get the maximum benefit for the
society. Hence the term “Political Economy”.
The existence of human wants is the starting point of all economic activity in
the world. Unless we make efforts, we cannot satisfy wants. Hence, wants, efforts
and satisfaction form the circle of economics. We may say economics is the science
of wants. But in the real world, the means which satisfy our wants are limited, that
is, there is scarcity of the means which satisfy our wants. Time and money are
limited. And land, labour and capital which are used in production are limited. Though
science has increased our resources, our wants have also increased. We may satisfy
some wants now. But soon, new wants appear. But all our wants cannot be satisfied
because means are limited.
We study economics because there is scarcity of many goods we want.
This problem is common to the individual as well as the State. That is why we say
Economics is the science of scarcity. And scarcity is the basic fact of life.
Our wants are unlimited but means are limited. This leads to choicemaking.
If there is unlimited supply of goods which satisfy our wants, the problem of choice
will not arise. It is true that we have many wants. But all wants are not of equal
importance. So we choose the more important and the more urgent wants. So choice
is the essence of economic activity. We may also say that economics is the science
of choice. Of course, all goods we want are not scarce. There are certain things like
air and sunshine which are available in abundance. Though they are very essential
for our life, we do not pay any price for them. They are free goods and they are not
very important for our study. But many things we want are scarce and we have to
pay a price for them. So, in economics, we study how prices of different things are
determined. We may also say that economics is a science that deals with pricing
process.
Modern economy is a monetary economy. Prices are paid in money. So
money plays an important role in the economic life of a society. It is used for buying 
2
and selling of goods, for payment of rent, wages, interest and so on. In economics,
we study about the role of money in the affairs of mankind.
We shall now sum up our discussion about the nature of economics.
Economics is a social science which studies about human wants and their
satisfaction. Human wants are unlimited. So scarcity is the fundamental fact of life.
As all wants are not of equal importance, this leads to choice. Economics is the
science of choice. As there is scarcity of goods, we have to pay a price for them.
So, economics studies about the pricing process. And, as prices are paid in money,
we study about the part played by money in the economic life of a society. We study
how people get and spend money, how they earn a living and how it affects their way
of life and so on. All the scarce goods which satisfy our wants are known as wealth.
So, in economics, we study about the production of wealth, exchange of wealth,
distribution of wealth and consumption of wealth. As wealth is produced to promote
human welfare, we study the relationship between wealth and welfare.
Definitions of Economics
We can have a good idea about the nature and scope of economics by
studying some of the important definitions of economics. Some of the important
definitions of economics are those of leading economists like Adam Smith, Alfred
Marshall, Lionel Robbins and Samuelson.
Adam Smith’s Definition (Wealth Definition)
Adam Smith (1723-90) defined economics as follows : “Economics is the
science of wealth”. He is the author of the famous book “Wealth of Nations” (1776).
He is known as the Father of Political Economy because he was the first person who
put all the economic ideas in a systematic way. It is only after Adam Smith, we study
economics as a systematic science.
The term “wealth” has a special meaning in Economics. In the ordinary
language, by “wealth”, we mean money, but in economics, wealth refers to those
goods which satisfy human wants. But we should remember all goods which satisfy
human wants are not wealth. For example, air and sunlight are essential for us. We
cannot live without them. But they are not regarded as wealth because they are
available in abundance and unlimited in supply. We consider only those goods which
are relatively scarce and have money value as wealth.
We study about consumption, production, exchange and distribution of
wealth. J.S. Mill defined economics as “the practical science of the production and
distribution of wealth”. Adam smith was of the view that economics was concerned
with the problems arising from wealth-getting and wealth-using activities of people.
He was interested mainly in studying the ways by which the wealth of all nations
could be increased.

Criticism
There is a lot of criticism against Adam Smith’s definition of economics. It has
got a bad name for economics. Some social scientists like Ruskin and Carlyle called
it “a dismal science”, “a dark science”. But this criticism is unfair, because it is based
on a misunderstanding about the nature and scope of economics. As this definition
emphasized “wealth”, they thought it is all about money. They concluded that
economics taught men and women how to make money. So they called it a selfish
science as in their opinion it emphasized on “the means to get rich”.
The above charge against economics is a false one. In economics, wealth
does not refer to money. It refers to the scarce goods which satisfy our wants.
Moreover, early economists used the term “wealth” in the sense of welfare.
A great demerit of Adam Smith’s definition is that there is overemphasis on
wealth. There is no doubt that we have to study about wealth in economics. But it can
be only a part of the study. There is the other side. In fact, it is a more important side
and that is the study of man. Economics is a social science. Hence the proper study
of mankind should be man and not wealth alone.
When we discuss Adam Smith’s definition of economics, we have to keep in
mind the time in which he lived. He was writing his book at a time when England
was on the eve of Industrial Revolution. The large investments of capital and use of
largescale machinery enabled England to produce wealth on a large scale. So it is
only natural that Adam Smith emphasized on wealth and considered economics as
“an enquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations”.
Alfred Marshall’s Definition (Welfare Definition)
Alfred Marshall (1842-1924) wrote a book Principles of Economics in 1890.
In it, he defined economics as “a study of mankind in the ordinary business of life”.
An altered form of this definition is : “Economics is a study of man’s actions in the
ordinary business of life”.
Marshall agrees that economics studies about wealth. But he does not accept
the view that economics studies about wealth alone. In the words of Marshall,
“Economics is on the one side a study of wealth, and on the other and more
important side, a part of the study of man. Man is the centre of his study. According to
him, the study of man is more important than the study of wealth.
In economics, we do not study about all aspects of humankind. As Cairncross
puts it, economics studies about man as “buyer and seller, producer and consumer,
saver and investor, employer and worker”. It studies about how people get their
income, how they use it and how they make best use of their resources.
Economics studies how people try “to increase the material means of wellbeing”.
4
According to this definition, we may say that economics is the study of the
causes of material welfare.
Marshall’s definition is known as material welfare definition of economics
because of its emphasis on welfare.
Criticism
There is no doubt that Marshall’s definition is a great improvement over the
definition of Adam Smith. For its emphasis is on social problems. And economics is
a social science. Moreover, it tells us about the link between wealth and welfare. But
the main idea of Marshall that economics is a science that deals with material welfare
has been strongly criticized. Lionel Robbins is a great critic of this definition. He says
that Marshall’s definition misrepresents the science of economics.
First, if we go by the definition of Marshall, in economics we should consider
only those activities which promote material welfare. But many activities do not
promote welfare but are rightly considered as economic activity. For example,
we know that alcoholic drinks and cigarettes are bad for our health. But these
commodities are produced and sold. There is a market for them. And there are
buyers and sellers. So the production and distribution of these goods is economic
activity. Let us take another example. War does not promote material welfare. But
we have “economics of war”. And it is an important branch of economics. There are
many economic problems with regard to war. Sometimes, the economic causes of
war are more important than the political and social causes. So it is not right to say
that economics studies material welfare.
Second, some activities promote welfare but not material welfare. For
example, the activities of doctors, lawyers, actors, musicians promote our welfare.
But their labour does not result in the production of material goods. If we follow the
material welfare definition of economics, we cannot consider the activities of the
above categories of labour as economic activity as they do not promote material
welfare. But we make use of their services. We pay a price, sometimes very high
price, for their services. Their services have economic value. It is misleading to
describe economics as the study of the causes of material welfare. In the words of
Lionel Robbins, “whatever economics is concerned with, it is not concerned with the
causes of material welfare as such”.
Third, Marshall’s definition is classificatory. It is not analytical. It considers the
production of material goods (e.g. chairs, tables, cycles and cars, bread) alone as
economic activity. As the services of a teacher or a judge do not produce material
goods, they are not considered as economic activity. This is a wrong view. As Lionel
Robbins says, “we do not say the production of potatoes is economic activity and the
production of philosophy is not”.
5
Lastly, by introducing ethical concepts like welfare, economics will become
an inexact science. For it is rather difficult to measure welfare. And some economic
policies which promote the welfare of some people may affect the welfare of others.
In spite of the above criticism against Marshall’s definition, we should not
forget that Marshall has widened the scope of economics by establishing a link
between wealth and man and his welfare.
Modern definitions of economics are based on a theory of scarcity and choice.
Lionel Robbins’ definition (Scarcity Definition)
Lionel Robbins has defined economics as follows : “Economics is the science
which studies human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce means
which have alternative uses”.
Robbins has given the above definition in his book “An Essay on the Nature
and significance of Economic Science”.
The definition of Robbins is based on the following basic assumptions
1. Ends are various. The term “ends” mean wants. Human wants are unlimited.
2. Means are limited. Means like time, money and resources are limited.
3. We can put time and money to alternative uses. For example, though time
is limited, we can use it for different purposes. We can use time for earning
money or we may enjoy it as leisure, and
4. All wants are not of equal importance.
We have to note certain things here. The fact that we have many wants is not
of interest to an economist by itself. For example if you want to do two things and you
have enough time and means with which to do them, and you do not want the time or
means for anything else, then you need not economize anything. Though your means
are limited, if they do not have alternative uses, you cannot economize anything.
Further, if all wants are of equal importance, you cannot economize anything. We
know time is limited. There are only 24 hours in a day. If a worker wants only money
he has to work for long hours and forgo leisure. If he wants leisure, he has to forgo
his income. He cannot have both at the same time.
We may, however, note that all means which satisfy human wants are not
limited. For example, air and sunshine are available in abundance. They are free
goods. But many things we want are scarce in relation to our wants. So economics
studies human behaviour as a relationship between unlimited wants and scarce
means. As means are limited, we have to pay a price for them. We study in
economics how the prices of scarce goods are determined. We have to choose
among different wants. That is why we say that scarcity and choice are central
problems in economics. Economics is the science of choice.
6
Choice between alternatives is the basic principle underlying all economic
activity. This is applicable to all economic systems – capitalism, socialism and mixed
economy.
The capitalist economy is also known as market economy. There, the
consumer will have a wider choice than in a socialist economy which is also known
as command economy. A socialist economy is a planned economy. As all basic
decisions are taken by the government, the consumer will have limited choice. And
we have mixed economy. India is a good example of mixed economy where public
sector and private sector play important roles in different economic fields. In some
fields, the consumer has more choice and in other areas where the State has
greater control, he has limited choice. But under all these systems, there is some
kind of planning, it is a question of degree. And all economic life involves planning.
As Robbins puts it. “To plan is to act with a purpose, to choose, and choice is the
essence of economic activity”. Lionel Robbins’ definition is also known as scarcity
definition of economics.
Criticism
The definition of Marshall classified human behaviour into economic activity
and non-economic activity. It considered only those activities which promoted
material welfare as economic activity. But Robbins’ definition covers the whole field.
If there is scarcity of a thing in relation to the demand for it, it becomes the subject –
matter of economics. That way, even the labour of those who provide services (eg.
lawyers, doctors, actors) are taken for study in economics.
Another merit of Robbins’ definition is it makes economics a scientific study.
Ethical aspects of economic problems are not taken into account in discussions. In
other words, the moral aspects are not considered. And it does not try to establish a
link between economics and welfare. But some economists criticize this view. They
say that as economics is a social science, its aim should be promotion of human
welfare. That is why some economists say Robbins’ definition has no human touch
about it. It looks at economics only as the science of pricing process. But economics
is more than a theory of value or resource allocation.
According to Robbins, an economic problem will arise only when there is
scarcity, but it may arise during times of abundance as well. For example, the great
depression of 1930s was caused not so much by scarcity but by plenty. That is why
the world depression was described as poverty in the midst of plenty.
In spite of the above criticisms, we have to note that most of the economists
have accepted the definition of Robbins because it emphasizes scarcity and choice
which are two important facts of life under all economic, political and legal systems.
It is true that there have been improvements in the methods of production
because of technological advancements. But scarcities are always with us. That is
why we say economics is the science of scarcity.
7
Samuelson’s Definition (Modern Definition of Economics)
Samuelson’s definition is known as a modern definition of economics.
According to Samuelson, “Economics is a social science concerned chiefly
with the way society chooses to employ its resources, which have alternative uses, to
produce goods and services for present and future consumption”.
The above definition is general in nature. There are many common points in
the definitions of Robbins and Samuelson.
Samuelson’s definition tells us that economics is a social science and it
is mainly concerned with the way how society employs its limited resources for
alternative uses. All this we find in the definition of Robbins. But Samuelson goes a
step further and discusses how a society uses limited resources for producing goods
and services for present and future consumption of various people or groups.
An interesting point that Samuelson tells is that the society may or may not
make use of money.
Net Economic Welfare (NEW)
Samuelson has coined the concept of Net Economic Welfare.
“According to Samuelson, “Net Economic Welfare (NEW) is an adjusted
measure of total national output that includes only consumption and investment items
that contribute directly to economic welfare”.
As we become rich, generally, we prefer leisure to income. When we allocate
more time for leisure, gross national product (GNP) may come down. But welfare
goes up. So when we estimate GNP, we must include satisfaction, derived from
leisure by giving it a value in Net Economic Welfare.
Women do a lot of work at home and it is not taken into account while
calculating GNP. But we must include that while estimating GNP. Only then, we will
get a correct picture of NEW.
In any society, there will be some illegal activities. (eg. drug trade). We should
not include it in NEW. They are “social bads”
There are some underground activities. Those who earn huge incomes (eg.
lawyers, accountants, actors) may not report actual income for tax purposes.
This unaccounted money (black money) must somehow be included in GNP
estimates. Otherwise, we will get a lower figure for GNP.
During the process of economic growth, there will be environmental pollution.
To get NEW, we should deduct the cost of pollution from the G.N.P.
8
The concept of Net Economic Welfare has become very important in the study
of National Income.
Main Divisions of Economics
There are four main divisions of economics. They are consumption,
production, exchange and distribution. In modern times, economists add one more
division and that is public finance. In public finance, we study about the economics of
government. The economic functions of the modern State have increased to a great
extent. So public finance has become an important branch of economics.
All the above divisions are interrelated. And they are dependent on each other.
Consumption
Consumption deals with the satisfaction of human wants. There is economic
activity in the world because there are wants. When a want is satisfied, the process
is known as consumption. Generally, in plain language, when we use the term
“consumption”, what we mean is usage. But in economics, it has a special meaning.
We can speak of the consumption of the services of a lawyer, just as we speak of the
consumption of food.
In the sub-division dealing with consumption, we study about the nature of
wants, the classification of wants and some of the laws dealing with consumption
such as the law of diminishing marginal utility, Engel’s law of family expenditure and
the law of demand.
Production
Production refers to the creation of wealth. Strictly speaking, it refers to the
creation of utilities. And utility refers to the ability of a good to satisfy a want. There
are three kinds of utility. They are form utility, place utility and time utility. Production
refers to all activities which are undertaken to produce goods which satisfy human
wants. Land, labour, capital and organization are the four factors of production. In
the sub- division dealing with production, we study about the laws which govern the
factors of production. They include Malthusian Theory of population and the laws of
returns. We also study about the localization of industries and industrial organization.
Exchange
In modern times, no one person or country can be self-sufficient. This gives
rise to exchange. In exchange, we give one thing and take another. Goods may
be exchanged for goods or for money. If goods are exchanged for goods, we call it
barter. Modern economy is a money economy. As goods are exchanged for money,
we study in economics about the functions of money, the role of banks and we also
study how prices are determined. We also discuss various aspects of international
trade.
9
Distribution
Wealth is produced by the combination of land, labour, capital and
organization. And it is distributed in the form rent, wages, interest and profits. In
economics, we are not much interested in personal distribution. That is, we do
not analyse how it is distributed among different persons in the society. But we
are interested in functional distribution. As the four factors or agents of production
perform different functions in production, we have to reward them.
Public Finance
Public finance deals with the economics of government. It studies mainly
about the income and expenditure of government. So we have to study about
different aspects relating to taxation, public expenditure, public debt and so on.
Conclusion
We may note that the subject of economics is divided into consumption,
production, exchange, distribution, and public finance only for the sake of
convenience.
We should not look at it in a rigid way. We must not consider them as
watertight compartments. They are related to each other and they are interdependent
also. For example, we cannot have consumption without production. The aim of
production is creation of wealth. And we produce wealth not for its own sake but
for the satisfaction of human wants. In other words, we produce goods because
we want them for consumption. So the ultimate aim of production is promotion of
human welfare. Production is means and consumption is the end. Generally, people
produce goods for market. So exchange takes place. Exchange is the connecting link
between production and consumption. The economic welfare of people in a nation
depends on how wealth is produced and on how it is distributed. If there is no proper
distribution, it will result in inequalities of income and wealth. This, in turn, will affect
consumption and production. So we find that all the divisions of economics are
interrelated and interdependent.
Economics : positive or normative science ?
There is no need for us to ask the question whether economics is a positive
science or normative science. Instead of that, we may look at it as a subject that has
two parts, namely positive economics and normative economics. As Asimakopulos
puts it, “positive economics can be defined as a body of systematized knowledge
concerning what is, while normative economics tries to develop criteria for what ought
to be”
Positive economics is mainly concerned with the description of economic
events and it tries to formulate theories to explain them. But in normative economics,
we give more importance to ethical judgements. Normative economics is concerned
with the ideal rather than the actual situations.
10
Statements on economics may be classified into positive statements and
normative statements. If there is disagreement over a statement, we can find out
whether it is true or false by verifying facts. But when there is disagreement over
a normative statement, we cannot settle the issue simply by appealing to facts.
The questions, “what are the policies that the Government should follow to reduce
unemployment ? what should it do to reduce inflation ? are all questions in positive
economics. On the other hand, if we ask the question, “should the government be
more concerned about unemployment than inflation ?”, then it is a normative one.
Economists like Lionel Robbins believe that we must leave normative questions,
such as what ought to be done to political and moral philosophy and that we must
study and analyse only positive questions. Robbins tells that an economist as
an economist has no business to pronounce judgements on the ethical aspects of
economic question. He feels that if normative considerations are taken into account,
economics cannot be an exact science. But many economists differ from this view.
They believe that as economics as a social science has to promote human welfare,
we have to consider ethical issues in economics. Now, we have a new and important
branch of economics known as “welfare economics”.
Economics in relation to other social sciences
Economics is a social science which deals with human wants and their
satisfaction. It is related to other social sciences like sociology, politics, history,
ethics, jurisprudence and psychology. For example, the economic development of
a nation depends not only on economic factors but also on historical, political and
sociological factors. Our country did not have much of economic progress during
the British rule owing to historical reasons. Again, we had slow but steady economic
growth in our country because of political stability. But in many other countries, there
was no steady growth because of political instability. If there is one government today
and another government tomorrow, there will not be economic development in that
country.
We shall discuss, in some detail, economics in its relation to other social
sciences.
Economics and Sociology
Sociology is the science of society. Social sciences like politics and economics
may be considered as the branches of sociology. Sociology is a general social
science. It attempts to discover the facts and laws of society as a whole. Sociology
deals with all aspects of society. But economics deals only with the economic aspects
of a society. It studies human behaviour in relation to scarce means and unlimited
wants. For a student of sociology, social institutions like marriage, religion, political
institutions and economic conditions are all important subjects for study. But in
economics, we are interested in them only to the extent that they affect the economic
life of a society. And we cannot properly understand the economic conditions of a 
11
society without considering its sociological aspects. Though economics is a branch of
sociology, we must look at it as a separate and distinct branch.
Economics and Politics
Both economics and politics are social sciences and there is a close
connection between them. Politics is the science of the State or political society. It
studies about man in his relation to the State.
The production and distribution of wealth are influenced to a very great extent
by the government. We have economic planning in our country. And the main aim of
planning is to increase the national income by increasing production and by a proper
distribution of income.
The Planning Commission, which is an agency of the government, plays
a vital role in it. Some of the important questions like nationalization, privatization
and prohibition are all economic as well as political questions. Elections are fought
often in many countries on economic issues. Unemployment, labour disputes are
all economic issues. But government has to tackle them. The relationship between
economics and politics is so great that the early economists described economics as
political economy.
Sometimes, political ideas and institutions are influenced by economic
conditions. For example, socialism was born of economic inequalities and
exploitation in England during the industrial revolution. Karl Marx is considered as the
Father of (scientific) socialism.
Economics and History
Economics and history are closely related. History is a record of the past
events. In history, we survey economic, political and social conditions of the people
in the past. To a student of history, love affairs, marriages and even murders of
kings are important subjects of study. For example, the murder of Julius Caesar
is important for a student of Roman history. In our country, the religious policy of
Mughal emperors is important for a student of history. But we are interested in history
only to the extent that it will help us in understanding economic problems of the past.
As students of economics, we are interested in things like taxation and other
sources of revenue and standard of living in the past.
In economics, we make use of historical data to formulate economic laws. We
make use of history in economics to study the material conditions of people in the
past. There is a separate branch of economics known as “Economic History”.
We may say economics is the fruit of history and history in the root of
economics:
“Economics without history has no root;
History without economics has no fruit”.
12
Economics and Ethics
Ethics is a social science. It deals with moral questions. It discusses the rules
that govern right conduct and morality. It deals with questions of right and wrong. It
aims at promoting good life.
There is connection between economics and ethics. While economics,
according to Marshall, aims at promoting material welfare, ethics aims at promoting
moral welfare. When we discuss economic problems, often we consider ethical
issues. The government introduced prohibition in many states for ethical reasons,
though there was heavy loss of revenue to it.
But Lionel Robbins strongly believes that an economist as an economist
should not consider ethical aspects of economic problems. But many economists
do not agree with him. They believe that economics cannot be dissociated from
ethics. Even Marshall considered economics as a handmaid of ethics. He looked at
economics as a study of means to better the conditions of human life.
Economics and Jurisprudence
Jurisprudence is the science of law. The economic progress of a nation
depends to a great extent on its legal system. Good laws promote economic
progress and bad laws act as an impediment to growth. For example, in the past
when we welcomed foreigners to invest in our country, they used to say our taxation
was complex and not good. Of course, now things have improved. So we must
have simple and clear laws in the fields of taxation and labour legislation to promote
economic progress.
Economics and psychology
Psychology is the science of mind. It deals with all kinds of human behaviour.
For example, we have child psychology, mob psychology, industrial psychology
and criminal psychology. But economics studies one aspect of human behaviour.
It studies human behaviour with reference to unlimited wants and limited means.
Of late, psychology has become important in analyzing economic problems. To
deal with labour problems, we must understand industrial psychology. And a good
businessman must understand the psychology of buyers whenever he wants
to change the price of his good. Many important laws of economics are based on
psychology. For example, we have the law of diminishing marginal utility. It tells that
the more and more of a thing you have, the less and less you want it.
Economics, mathematics and statistics
Among other sciences, economics is related to mathematics and statistics.
Statistics is the science of averages. It is the science of counting. Many tables and
diagrams used in economics are based on statistical analysis. Mathematical methods
are largely used in modern economics.
13
Now we have a new science called econometrics. It makes use of statistics
and mathematics in economics. The econometric society was founded in 1930, and
the first Nobel prize in economics was awarded to Jan Tinberen and Ragnar Frisch
for their contribution to econometrics.
Static and dynamic concepts
Time element is very useful in studying the working of an economy. There
are two main lines of approach. They are 1. static analysis and 2. dynamic analysis.
In the case of static analysis, we examine a problem at any given moment of time.
Even in static analysis, sometimes we consider a short period rather than a single
point. We assume that some changes take place during the short period. The
method of approach where we take note of changes in the short period is known as
comparative statics. For example, in comparative statics, we compare the state of
economy at one moment to the state of the economy at another moment. Marshall’s
analysis of supply and demand is a good example of comparative statics.
In dynamic analysis, we examine the path or process by which the economy
moves from one state of equilibrium to another. Time element is an important factor
in dynamic analysis. Change is the key word in dynamic analysis. For example,
investment during a period may depend upon the rate of interest in the previous
period. The study of the trade cycle may be given as a good example of dynamic
analysis.
Stocks and flows
Stocks and flows are basic concepts in economics. Stocks can be measured
at a given point of time. A flow is a quantity that can be measured only in terms of a
specified period of time. In other words, it has a time dimension. For example, wealth
is a stock and income is a flow.
Micro economics and macro economics
Economic theory can be broadly divided into micro economics and
macroeconomics. The term micro means small and macro means large.
In microeconomics, we deal with problems such as the output of a single
firm or industry, price of a single commodity and spending on goods by a single
household.
Macroeconomics studies the economic system as a whole. In it, we get a
complete picture of the working of the economy. It is a study of the relations between
broad economic aggregates such as total employment, saving and investment. We
may also say that macro economics is the theory of income, employment, prices and
money. That is why macroeconomics is sometimes studied under the title “Income
and Employment Analysis”.
14
Economics as a science
We no longer ask the question whether economics is a science or an art.
Science is a systematized body of knowledge. Just as physics and chemistry are
sciences, economics is also a science. We observe facts, conduct experiments and
make generalizations in physics and chemistry after testing the results. The same
scientific methods are followed in economics also. Economics, like all other sciences,
studies the relationship between cause and effect.
Sciences may be broadly divided into physical sciences and social sciences.
Physics and chemistry are examples of physical sciences. Economics is a social
science. It studies about a particular aspect of human behaviour. And human
behaviour is full of complexity. It is not easy to study it. So economic science is not as
precise and exact as the physical sciences.
But economics has a greater right to be considered as a science than other
social sciences like politics or history because in economics we make use of money
as a measuring rod of utility. It is true that it is only a rough measure but still it
enables us to give concrete shape to the laws of economics. Sometimes, what we
say in economics may not come true in real life. But this is the case with many other
sciences. For example, we joke about weather forecasts. The weather report in the
newspaper may say that there will be heavy rainfall on a particular day. But there
might not be any rain at all on that particular day. On account of that, we cannot
say that meteorology (the science of weather) is not a science. Similarly, if some
economic laws do not come true, we cannot say that economics is not a science.
Methods of Economic Analysis
In economics, broadly we make use of two methods.
1. Deductive method and
2. Inductive method
The deductive method is also known as abstract method or analytical method.
This method is based on a priori reasoning and conclusions are drawn from certain
fundamental assumptions. Deduction method was very popular among the Greeks.
Here is an example :
All men are mortal
Socrates is a man
Socrates is mortal
The deductive method moves from the general assumption to the specific
application.
Ricardo, a classical economist, made use of the deductive method.
15
The inductive method moves from specific observations to generalization. It
was Francis Bacon who advocated inductive method in scientific enquiry.
None of the above methods provides satisfactory system for solution of
problems. So Darwin, who is famous for this theory of evolution, by introducing the
concept of hypothesis, has combined deductive and inductive methods.
The important elements of Darwin’s deductive-inductive method are
1. Identification of a problem
2. formulation of hypothesis (a hypothesis is an assumption or an intelligent
guess)
3. collection, organization and analysis of data
4. formulation of conclusions
5. verification, rejection or modification of the hypothesis after testing it.
In the past, there was a debate among economists about the question which
is the best method ? inductive or deductive ? But the controversy is not there now.
Today, economists feel that both induction and deduction are necessary for the
science, just as the right and the left foot are needed for walking.
Economic Laws
Like other social sciences, economics has its own laws. A law is a statement of
what must happen given certain conditions. Every cause has a tendency to produce
some result. For example, in Physics, we study that things fall to the ground because
of gravitation. The law of gravitation is a statement of tendency. Similarly, the laws
of economics are statements of tendencies. For example, according to the law of
demand, when there is fall in the price of a good, the demand for it will expand. It
means that there is a tendency among people to buy more when there is fall in the
price of a good. Similarly, if price rises, they will buy less. Laws operate under certain
conditions. If these conditions change, they will not operate. This is applicable to all
sciences. When some economic laws do not operate, it means that the conditions
have changed.
We may broadly classify sciences into physical sciences and social sciences.
Physics and chemistry are examples of physical sciences. Economics, politics are
examples of social sciences. The laws of physical sciences are exact. But the laws
of economics are not as exact as the laws of physical sciences. For example, we
have the law of gravitation. It is a simple and exact statement. But in economics,
we deal with human beings and their behaviour with reference to economic activity.
We cannot conduct experiments with human beings either within the laboratory or
outside it. That is why economic laws cannot be as exact as the laws of physical
sciences. We may also note that we study about average human behaviour in
economics.
16
As economics deals with man and his behaviour, its laws are complex
and inexact. That is why Marshall has said that “the laws of economics are to be
compared with the laws of tides rather than with the simple and exact law of
gravitation”. The science of tides explains the tides rise and fall under the influence of
the Sun and the Moon. Probably there will be high tide on a full moon night. It may be
there or it may not be there. It is only a probability.
Similarly, economic laws also indicate probable trends. For example, when
there is increase in the quantity of money, there may be increase in the price level.
But we cannot say exactly by how much prices will rise. But economic laws are more
exact than the laws of history and politics because economics make use of money
as a measuring rod of utility. Though money is a rough measure, it gives a concrete
shape to economic laws.
All economic laws are based on certain assumptions. Let us take the law of
demand. It tells that “other things being equal”, when the price of a good falls, people
will buy more of the good. By “other things being equal” we mean (1) that the income
of the people remains the same, (2) that their tastes remain the same (3) that the
prices of other goods remain the same, and (4) that no new substitute for the good is
discovered. The law will hold good only when the above assumptions are fulfilled.
Sometimes, it is said that the laws of economics are hypothetical. That is, we
make an hypothesis. Only after it is verified by facts and experiments and found true,
it becomes a law. But many economic laws cannot be verified by experiment. That is
why we say sometimes that economic laws are hypothetical.
The laws of physical sciences have universal application. But that is not
generally the case with regard to economic laws. Of course, there are one or two
exceptions. The Law of Diminishing Returns has universal application.
Importance of Economic Laws
Economic laws are of great importance in practical life. Some economic laws
are applicable to all types of economic systems. They have universal application. For
example, we have the law of Diminishing Returns. There are other important laws
such as the law of diminishing marginal utility and the law of demand.
Some economists believe that the quantity theory of money is valid under all
economic systems – capitalism or socialism or mixed economy.
Let us take some important laws like the law of diminishing marginal utility,
the law of demand, the law of diminishing returns and the Malthusian Theory of
population and discuss their significance.
The law of diminishing utility is based on actual experience. It tells that the
more and more of a thing you have, the less and less you want it. It explains the
relationship between the price of a good and the satisfaction you get from it. During 
17
summer, generally, there will be fall in the price of mangoes because they are
available in plenty. So there is diminishing utility. And as price is related to marginal
utility, the price falls. Progressive taxation is based on the law of diminishing utility. As
the income increases, the Government ask the rich to pay more taxes by increasing
the rates of taxation for them. For it believes that as a man gets more and more
money, he will get diminishing utility from it. So even if he parts with more money, the
sacrifice will not be much in his case.
The law of demand is based on actual experience. In practice we find that
when price falls, demand increases. Price falls when supply is more. When there is
increase in the supply of a good, its marginal utility diminishes. A seller will try to sell
more of his good by reducing its price slightly.
The law of diminishing marginal returns has universal application. In
agriculture, it means that we cannot double the output by doubling labour and capital.
The law applies to manufacturing industry also.
The Malthusian theory of population tells that population increases at a faster
rate than food supply. It might not be an exact statement. But it was true in the case
of most of the poor countries of the world until the Green Revolution. The Green
Revolution helped in increasing agricultural productivity. There is the problem of
over– population in most of the poor countries of the world. That is why they spend
huge amounts on family planning to reduce population growth. So, most of the laws
of economics are of great practical importance.
Basic Concepts
Every science has its own language. Economics has its own language. There
are certain terms which are used in a special sense in economics. So we must
understand the meaning of some basic concepts like wealth, goods, income, value,
price and market. If we do not understand their meaning properly, it may result in a lot
of confusion.
Wealth
In ordinary speech, when we refer to wealth, we mean money. But in
economics, it has a special meaning. It refers to those scarce goods which satisfy
our wants and which have money value. We may consider anything that has money
value as wealth in economics.
All economic goods have value–in–exchange. So wealth includes all economic
goods. Wealth has been defined as “stock of goods existing at a given time that have
money value”.
18
Characteristics of Wealth
The following are the characteristics of wealth :
1. It must possess utility. It must have the power to satisfy a want. As Marshall says
“they must be desirable”.
2. It must be limited in supply. For example, air and sunshine are essential for life.
We cannot live without them. But we do not consider them as wealth because they
are available in large quantities. Such goods are known as free goods.
3. Wealth should be transferable. That is, it should be possible for us to transfer the
ownership from one person to another.
4. It must have money value.
5. It may be external. For example, the goodwill of a company is external wealth.
Utility, scarcity and transferability are thus important characteristics of wealth.
Classification of Wealth
Wealth may be classified into a) personal wealth (individual wealth) b) social
wealth (collective wealth), c) national wealth (a + b) and d) cosmopolitan wealth (e.g.
ocean).
Goods
Anything that satisfies a human want can be considered as “good” in
economics. In economics, the term “goods” refer to material and non-material things.
Just as an apple or a chair is a good, music or the services of actors, musicians and
teachers are some of the examples of goods.
Goods can be classified into free goods and economic goods. Goods like
air and sunlight which are the gifts of nature are free goods. They are not scarce.
So they do not command a price in the market. They are known as free goods.
Economic goods command a price in the market. In other words, they have valuein-exchange.
For, they are scarce in relation to demand. In this connection, we have
to remember that what is a free good in one place can become an economic good
in another place. It all depends on the supply of a good and the demand for it. For
example, in some villages firewood is a free good. But in a town where we have to
pay a price for it, it becomes an economic good. Similarly, water which is a free good
becomes an economic good when there is scarcity of water.
Goods may be further classified into (1) consumers goods and (2) producers
goods. Consumers goods satisfy our wants directly. They can be classified into (1)
perishable goods (eg. vegetables, fish and music) and (2) durable goods (eg. a
house, a car, a radio). Capital goods satisfy our wants indirectly. Machines that
are used to make machines are called capital goods. For example, car is a sort of 
19
machine. It is a consumers’ good. But there must be some other machine to make
a car. That machine is known as capital good or producer good. But what is a
consumers’ good in one place can become a producers’ good in another place. For
example, when electricity is used for lighting purposes at home, it is a consumers’
good. But the same electricity when used in factories for industrial purposes, it
becomes a producers’ good.
Income
In economics, when we refer to income, generally we mean money income.
According to Seligman, “Income in the economic sense, is the flow of satisfactions
from economic goods”. We know that all economic goods form wealth. The main
source of income is wealth. For example, if you own a house, it is your wealth. If
you get rent from it, it is your income. There are two points about income – time and
amount.
There are two kinds of income – (1) money income and (2) Real Income.
Generally people earn their incomes in the form of money.
Money income is also known as nominal income. But the standard of living
of people of a country depends on their real income. Real income depends upon
the purchasing power of money and that in turn depends on the price level. Real
income refers to the command of a person over actual commodities and services.
Just because money incomes of people increase, we cannot say they are better off. It
all depends upon how many goods they can command.
Suppose, my money income is Rs. 10, and price of one kilo of rice is Rs. 10,
then I can buy one kilo of rice or my income is worth of only one kilo of rice. In the
next month, my money income is raised to Rs. 15, but the price of one kilo of rice is
increased to Rs. 20. Now my income is worth only ¾ kilo of rice. Therefore, in spite of
increase in money income, my real income has come down due to higher increase in
price. Real income is price adjusted money income.
National Income : National income refers to the value of commodities and
services produced by a country during a year.
Marshall defined national income as follows : “The labour and capital of a
country acting on its natural resources produce annually a certain net aggregate of
commodities, material and immaterial, including services of all kinds……… This is
true net annual income or revenue of the country, or the national dividend”.
From the national income of a country, we can find out whether the country is
rich or poor. And from the composition of national income, we can find out the relative
importance of agriculture, industry and service sector in the economy.
We get per capita income [(i.e) income per person per year] by dividing
national income by the population of the country.
20
National Income
 Population Per capita income =
Value
The term “value” refers to the exchange qualities of a good. According to
Marshall, “the term value, is relative and expresses the relation between two things at
a particular place and time”.
Value is of two kinds (1) value–in–use and (2) value–in– exchange. Although
air, rain and sunshine have value–in–use, they do not have value–in–exchange. In
economics, we are interested only in those goods which have value–in–exchange.
For a good to have value– in–exchange, it must possess utility, it must be scarce in
relation to demand and it must be possible for us to exchange it. In other words, all
economic goods have value-in-exchange.
Value is generally measured in money and it is a relative term. The value of
a thing changes according to time and situation. For example, ice has more value in
summer than in winter.
Price
When value is expressed in money, it is called price. Generally, economists
make no distinction between value and price. All prices are related to one another.
They form the price system. The prices most familiar to us are the prices we pay
for goods sold in market, that is, retail prices. Many payments like rent, wages and
interest are also prices which we pay respectively to land, labour and capital. Price
system plays a very important role in a capitalistic economy. Buyers express their
desire for goods only through prices. Every price we pay for a good is a vote in
favour of it. It is the price system that regulates the economic activity of a society.
Market
In the ordinary language, market refers to a place where goods are bought
and sold. Thus Koyambedu market in Chennai refers to a place where vegetables
are sold. In economics, market does not refer to any particular place in which goods
are bought and sold. But it refers to buying and selling of a commodity. In a market
a commodity is bought and sold under given conditions and there will be a number
of buyers and sellers who will be in close touch with each other. For example, a fish
market refers to buying and selling of fish; here both buyers and sellers are in close
contact. According to Benham, “Market is any area over which the buyers and sellers
are in close touch with one another either directly or through dealers, that prices
obtainable in one part of market affect the prices paid in other parts”.
Generally speaking, when we talk of markets, we refer to commodities that are
bought and sold. But there are markets for things other than commodities. Thus there
are labour markets, foreign exchange market, capital market and so on. For example, 
21
we may say the market for an actor, say ‘X’, is dull. So there may be a market for
anything which has a price.
Classification of Markets : Markets may be classified according to space, time
and the nature of competition. According to space,markets are classified into local
market (eg. vegetables, flowers), national market (e.g. sarees) and international
market (e.g steel, cotton, sugar, tea).
Markets can also be classified according to the type of competition. Thus,
broadly we have perfect markets and imperfect markets.
Markets can also be classified into short period markets and long period
markets according to time. If the period is short, demand plays an important role in
the market and if the period is longer, supply plays an important role. Thus markets
can be classified according to space, time and the nature of competition that prevails.
Importance of Economics
Economics has become one of the important branches of social sciences. It
is of great practical value in our daily life. In pure sciences, we study the subject to
arrive at the truth. But an economist is a social scientist. He studies the subject not
only to know the truth for its own sake, but to find out a way for many economic
and social problems of the society. “Knowledge for the sake of knowledge” is not the
goal of an economist. Economics must be fruit-bearing. Of course, an economist has
no readymade answer for immediate problems. But he can help the Government
in making broad economic policies. According to Keynes, “the theory of economics
does not furnish a body of settled conclusions immediately applicable to policy. It is
a method, rather than a doctrine, an apparatus of the mind, a technique of thinking,
which helps its possessor to draw correct conclusions”.
Most of the problems of the modern State are economic in nature. So
economists play an important role in the affairs of the State. During World War II,
the German economy was damaged heavily. There was inflation, shortage of goods
and mass unemployment. But the German economy recovered quickly by following
the advice of an economist Ludwig Erhard. The German recovery is considered an
economic miracle.
Similarly, J.M.Keynes, had great influence on the economic policies of the
American government when it was in great economic trouble during the 1930s.
In economics, we study about things like prices, rent, wages, interest, profits
and taxation. All these affect every person one way or the other. It has been rightly
said, “you cannot be in any real sense a citizen, unless you are also in some degree
an economist”.

Basic Economic Problems
Economics is the science of making choice under conditions of scarcity. What
are the basic issues about which choices are to be made? Any society must make
choices about three important problems. They are
1. What to produce and in what quantities ?
Food or weapons; if so, in what quantities ?
Is it more food and less weapons or vice versa ?
2. How shall goods be produced?
Electricity from thermal power or from hydro power ?
3. For whom shall the goods be produced ?
A few rich and many poor or most people in modest comfort ?
These three basic problems are interdependent. The society must make
proper choice about them in order to meet the development aspirations of people
satisfactorily. The above three questions are common to all economies but every
economic system attempts to make its own choice. The nature of a particular choice
in a particular society depends on its specific economic system.
Economic Systems
An economic system is a way of answering these basic questions. Different
economic systems answer the above questions differently. An economic system
refers to how the different economic elements will solve the central problems of
an economy: what, how and for whom to produce. It refers to the production and
distribution of goods and services within which economic activity takes place. It refers
to the way different economic elements, individual workers and managers, productive
organization such as factories or firms and government agencies are linked together
to form an organic whole.
Economic system consists of various individuals and their institutions like
banking institutions, educational institutions and economic institutions. The most
general economic systems are:
1. Traditional Economy
2. Capitalist Economy
3. Socialist Economy
4. Mixed Economy
25
I. Traditional Economy
In traditional economy, the basic problems are solved by traditions and custom
rules every aspect of behaviour. It produces exactly to its consumption requirements.
It is a subsistence economy. There is not much of sales as there is only small scale
production. The same product will be produced by every generation. The production
techniques are traditional.
II. Capitalist Economy
A capitalist economy is an economic system in which the production and
distribution of commodities take place through the mechanism of free markets.
Hence it is also called as market economy or free trade economy. Each individual be
it a producer, consumer or resource owner has considerable economic freedom. An
individual has the freedom to buy and sell any number of goods and services and to
choose any occupation. Thus a market economy has no central coordinator guiding
its operation. But self-organization emerges amidst the functioning of market forces
namely supply, demand and price. The salient features of capitalism are
1. Right to Private Property: Individuals have the right to buy and own property.
There is no limit and they can own any amount of property. They also have legal
rights to use their property in any way they like.
2. Profit-Motive: Profit is the only motive for the functioning of capitalism. Production
decisions involving high risks are taken by individual only to earn large profits.
Hence, profit-motive is the basic force that drives the capitalist economy.
3. Freedom of Choice: The question ‘what to produce?’ will be determined by the
producers. They have the freedom to decide. The factors of production can
also be employed anywhere freely to get due prices for their services. Similarly
consumers have the freedom to buy anything they want.
4. Market Forces: Market forces like demand, supply and price are the signals
to direct the system. Most of the economic activities are centered on price
mechanism. Production, consumption and distribution questions are expected to
be solved by market forces.
5. Minimal role of Government: As most of the basic economic problems are
expected to be solved by market forces, the government has minimal role in the
economy. Their role will be limited to some important functions. They include
regulation of market, defence, foreign policy, currency, etc.
Merits of Capitalist Economy
1. Increase in productivity: In a capitalist economy every farmer, trader or
industrialist can hold property and use it in any way he likes. He increases the
productivity to meet his own self-interest.This in turn leads to increase in income,
saving and investment.
26
2. Maximizes the Welfare: It is claimed that there is efficiency in production and
resource use without any plan. The self-interest of individual also promotes
society’s welfare.
3. Flexible System: The shortages and surpluses in the economy are generally
adjusted by the forces of demand and supply. Thus it operates automatically
through the price mechanism.
4. Non-interference of the State: The State has a minimum role to play. There is no
conflict between the individual interest and the society. The economic institutions
function automatically preventing the interference of the government.
5. Low cost and qualitative products: The consumers and producers have full
freedom and therefore it leads to production of quality products at low costs and
prices.
6. Technological improvement: The element of competition under capitalism drives
the producers to innovate something new to boost the sales and thereby bring
about progress.
Disadvantages of Capitalist Economy
1. Inequalities: Capitalism creates extreme inequalities in income and wealth. The
producers, landlords, traders reap huge profits and accumulate wealth. Thus the
rich become richer and the poor poorer. The poor with limited means are unable
to compete with the rich. Thus capitalism widens the gap between the rich and
the poor creating inequality.
2. Leads to Monopoly: Inequality leads to monopoly. Mega corporate units replace
smaller units of production. Firms combine to form cartels, trusts and in this
process bring about reduction in number of firms engaged in production. They
ultimately emerge as multinational corporations (MNCs) or transnational
corporations (TNCs). They often hike prices against the welfare of consumer.
3. Depression: There is over-production of goods due to heavy competition. The rich
exploit the poor. The poor are not able to take advantage of the production and
hence are exploited. At another level, over-production leads to glut in the market
and hence depression. This leads to economic instabilities.
4. Mechanisation and Automation: Capitalism encourages mechanization and
automation. This will result in unemployment particularly in labour surplus
economies.
5. Welfare ignored: Under capitalism, private enterprises produce luxury goods
which give higher profits and ignore the basic goods required which give less
profit. Thus the welfare of public is ignored.
27
6. Exploitation of Labour: Stringent labour laws are enacted for the exclusive profitmotive
of capitalists. Fire and hire policy will become the order of the day. Such
laws also help to exploit the labour by keeping their wage rate at its lowest
minimum.
7. Basic social needs are ignored: There are many basic social sectors like literacy,
public health, poverty, drinking water, social welfare, and social security. As the
profit margin in these sectors is low, capitalists will not invest. Hence most of
these vital human issues will be ignored in a capitalist system.
III. Socialist Economy
In a socialist economy, the means of production are owned and operated by
the State. All decisions regarding production and distribution are taken by the central
planning authority. Hence the socialist economy is also called as planned economy
or command economy. The government plays an active role. Social welfare is
given importance; hence equal opportunity is given to all. All such advantages have
delivered high level of human development. Some of the most successful socialist
economies are China, Cuba, Vietnam and North Korea. The following are the basic
characteristic features of socialism.
1. Social Welfare Motive: In socialist economies, social or collective welfare will be
the prime motive. Unlike capitalism, profit will not be the aim of policy making.
The decisions will be taken keeping the maximum welfare of the people in mind.
Thus social well-being of people will be the purpose of development.
2. Limited Right to Private Property: The right to private property is limited. All
properties of the country will be owned by the State. That is, the ownership is
collective in nature. Hence no individual can accumulate too much property as in
the case of capitalism.
3. Central Planning: Most of the economic policy decisions will be taken by a
centralized planning authority. Each and every sector of the economy will be
directed by well designed planning.
4. No Market Forces: In a centralized planned system of development, market
forces have only a limited role to play. Production, commodity and factor prices,
consumption and distribution will be governed by development planning with
welfare motive.
Merits of Socialist Economy
1. Efficient use of resources: The resources are utilized efficiently to produce
socially useful goods without taking the profit margin into account. Production is
increased by avoiding wastes of competition.
28
2. Economic Stability: Economy is free from business fluctuations. Government
plans well and everything is well coordinated to avoid over-production or
unemployment. There is stability because the production and consumption of
goods and services are well regulated.
3. Maximisation of Social Welfare: All citizens work for the welfare of the State.
Everybody receives his or her remuneration. The State concentrates on the
production of basic necessaries instead of luxury goods. The State provides
free education, cheap and congenial housing, public health amenities and social
security for the people.
4. Absence of Monopoly: The elements of corporation and monopoly are eliminated
since there is absence of private ownership. The state is a monopoly but
produces quality goods at reasonable price.
5. Basic needs are met: In socialist economies, basic human needs like water,
education, health, social security, etc, are provided. Human development is more
in socialist countries.
6. No extreme inequality: As social welfare is the ultimate goal, there is no
concentration of wealth. Extreme inequality is prevented in socialist system.
Demerits of Socialism
1. Bureaucratic Expansion: A socialist economy is operated under a centralized
command and control system. People here work out of fear of higher authorities.
It does not give any initiative for the people to work hard.
2. No Freedom: There is no freedom of occupation. Allocation of factors of
production is not done rationally. Jobs are provided by the State. Place of work is
also provided by the State. The consumer’s choice is very limited.
3. Absence of Technology: Work is monotonous and no freedom is given. Any
change in the production process will alter the entire plan. Hence any innovation
cannot be easily enforced. Everything is rigid and technological changes are
limited.
4. Absence of competition makes the system inefficient.
IV. Mixed Economy
In a mixed economy, both public and private institutions exercise economic
control. The public sector functions as a socialistic economy and the private sector
as a free enterprise economy. All decisions regarding what, how and for whom to
produce are taken by the State. The private sector produces and distributes goods
and services. It manufactures consumer and capital goods in the interest of public
welfare. A mixed economy possesses the freedom to hold private property, to earn
profit, to consume, produce and distribute and to have any occupation. But if these 
29
freedoms affect public welfare adversely, they are regulated and controlled by the
State. The main features of mixed economic system are:
1. Co-existence of Public and Private Sectors: In a mixed economy, both the
public and the private sectors initiatives will be there. The most strategically and
nationally important sectors of the economy will be reserved for the public sector.
The rest will be left for private operation. While the public sector will have social
welfare as the prime motive, the private sector will function with profit motive.
2. Consolidation of merits of Capitalism and Socialism: As seen above, both
capitalism and socialism have merits and demerits. Mixed economy is expected
to retain only the merits of the two systems. For instance, the government
is expected to allow private investment, but the government also controls
monopolies.
3. Planning: Economic planning is another important feature of the mixed economy.
Planning will direct the relative roles of public and private sectors and their
respective jurisdictions.
Merits of Mixed Economy
1. Efficient resource utilisation: The resources are utilized efficiently as good
features of both capitalism and socialism coexist. If there is misallocation of
resources, the State controls and regulates it. This ensures the efficient utilization
of resources.
2. Prices are administered: The prices are not fixed always by forces of demand and
supply. In the case of goods which are scarce, the prices are administered by the
government and such goods are also rationed.
3. Social Welfare: In a mixed economy, planning is centralized and there is overall
welfare. Workers are given incentives and reward for any innovations. There is
social security provided to the workers. Inequalities of income and wealth are
reduced.
Demerits of Mixed Economy
1. Lack of Co-ordination: The coordination between the public and private sectors
is poor in a mixed economy. Public sector spends huge public resources for
infrastructure. The private sector aims at profit maximization by using the
infrastructure created by the public sector. But they lack social responsibility
and fail to spend for public causes like health, education. The private sector also
dislikes any restriction imposed on it by the government.
2. Red –tapism and delay by Public Sector: There is every chance that the public
sector works inefficiently. There is too much of red-tapism and corruption
leading to delays in decision-making and project implementation. They result in
inefficiency and also affect production.
30
3. Economic Fluctuations: The mixed economies experience economic fluctuations.
On the one hand, the private sector does not operate under very rigid conditions
prescribed by the government. On the other hand, the public sector too does
not operate under very rigid conditions enforced by the planned economy. The
lack of policy coordination between private and public sector results in economic
fluctuations.
Production Possibilities
Another important question about the basic economic problems is: How do
we make choice in an economy?. At the individual level you must choose among
alternatives like,
- whether to watch cricket highlights in T.V. or study for another extra hour;
- whether to buy a text book for Rs.50 or spend the money for a movie;
- whether to help your mother in shopping or play hockey during that time;
It is important to note that choices are made due to scarcity. If there is no
scarcity, there would be no need to choose. Similarly as choice must be made from
alternatives, it involves comparison of cost and benefit.
Opportunity Cost
When you choose a particular alternative, the next best alternative must be
given up. For example, if you choose to watch cricket highlights in T.V., you must give
up an extra hour study. The choice of watching cricket in T.V. results in the loss of the
next best alternative- an extra hour study instead. Thus by watching T.V., you have
forgone the opportunity of scoring an extra five or ten marks in examination.
Thus the “opportunity cost” is the cost of something in terms of an opportunity
forgone (and the benefits that could be received from that opportunity). In other
words, the opportunity cost of an action is the value of next best alternative forgone.
The consideration of opportunity costs is one of the key differences between the
concepts of ‘economic cost’ and ‘accounting cost’. Choices are mostly made on the
basis of opportunity cost.
Production Possibility Curve
Like the individuals, a society as whole has limited resources. It has to decide
what to produce with the limited resource. It has to make choice about the quantity
of different commodities. Choice emanates from scarcity. Thus our choice is always
constrained or limited by scarcity of our resources. Suppose we have enough
resources we can produce all that we want.
All such choices can be made with help of production possibility curve. The
production-possibility curve separates outcomes that are possible for the society to
produce from those which cannot be produced subject to the available resources.
31
Let us consider an economy with only so many people, so many industries,
so much of electricity and natural resources in deciding what shall be produced
and how these resources are to be allocated among thousands of different possible
commodities. How many industries are to produce steel? How much electricity to be
provided for agriculture; how much for industries?. Whether to provide free electricity
to farmer or not? These problems are complicated. Therefore, to simplify let us
assume there are only two goods to be produced - apples and oranges.

In the above schedule A and E are possibilities where the economy either
produces 100 percent of apples or 100 percent of oranges alone. But the production
possibility curve assumes the production of two goods in different combinations.
Possibilities A, B,C ,D and E are such that the economy produces 4 units of apples
and 0 units of oranges in possibility A, 3 units of apples and 2 units of orange in
possibility B, 2 units of apples and 4 units of oranges in possibility C, 1 unit of apple
and 6 units of oranges in possibility D, 0 unit of apples and 8 units of oranges in
possibility E.

Production Possibility Curve
32
Thus we see that if we are willing to have more of oranges, we should be
willing to sacrifice more of apples. For instance, to reach possibility C from B, the
economy produces 2 units more of oranges by sacrificing 1 unit of apples. A full
employment economy must always- in producing one good be giving up something
of another. This assumes of course, that at least some resources can be transferred
from one good to another.
Such choice of one particular alternative involves opportunity cost of foregoing
the other. Hence, the decisions of the society will be based on the comparison of
costs and benefits of each alternative. In doing so, both the monetary and social cost
and benefit should be the basis of any choice. Thus the one that gives the maximum
benefit at minimum cost to the whole society should be the best choice. We can
picture the production possibility schedule by drawing a smooth curve (Figure 2.1).
Units of oranges are measured horizontally and that of apples on the vertical
axis. The curve A and E depict the various possible combinations of the two goods
- A, B, C, D, and E. Thus a list of all the possible combinations of apples and oranges
makes up production possibilities. The production possibility curve is also known
as transformation curve or production possibility frontier. This curve shows the rate
of transformation of one product into the other when the economy moves from one
possibility point to the other.
All possible combinations lying on the production possibility curve show the
combinations of the two goods that can be produced by the existing resources. Any
combination lying inside the production curve such as U in the figure indicates that
resources are not being fully employed in the best-known way. Any point outside
the production possibility frontier, such as L implies that the economy does not have
adequate resources to produce this combination. But a shift outside the production
possibility frontier certainly indicates economic development. This is possible by
technological advancement and increase in supply of factors of production.

Chapter 3
Theory of Consumer Behaviour
Introduction
The existence of human wants is the basis of all economic activity in a society.
All desires, tastes and motives of human beings are called wants in economics.
1. Wants may arise due to elementary and psychological causes. The wants for
food, clothing and housing are elementary and psychological.
2. Wants may arise due to social causes. As members of society, we may require
a particular type of dress and food.
3. Wants arise due to customs and habits like drinking tea and chewing.
4. Wants may arise due to advertisements.
In the early stages of civilisation, wants of men were few and simple. With
advancement of civilisation, wants have become unlimited and also complex. Man
tries to satisfy most of his wants through economic activity. Since the resources
are limited, he has to choose between urgent wants and not so urgent wants. A
systematic survey of this process is called consumption. Consumption means using
up of goods and services in the satisfaction of human wants. The economics of
consumption is related to a study of nature of wants and the behaviour of demand.
Characteristics of wants
1. Wants are unlimited: Man is a bundle of desires. There is no limit to human
wants. If one set of wants are fulfilled, immediately another set of wants would be
felt. Even the richest man will have a list of wants to be fulfilled.
2. Every want is satiable: wants in general are unlimited. But a single or a
particular want is satiable. We can completely satisfy a single want. A man is
hungry and he requires food. By spending some money on food, he can get food
and satisfy his hunger.
3. Wants are competitive: Wants are unlimited. The resources and time at our
disposal are much limited and we cannot satisfy all wants. So the wants will be
competing to get satisfied. One set of wants may be competing with other set of
wants to get preference of choosing first. For example, Raju has a sum of Rs.20.
With this amount of Rs.20, he has to choose between going to a movie, buying
a magazine or buying vegetables. Of course, a consumer will choose the more
urgent wants and distribute his income on several goods in such a manner as to
get maximum satisfaction.
4. Wants are complementary: Some wants are complementary in nature, i.e. they
have to be satisfied together. Though the want may be a single one, we require 
36
many commodities and services to satisfy that want. Want for ‘writing’ includes
want for paper, pen and ink. In some cases, wants may be both ‘competitive’ and
‘complementary’. For example, labour and machinery. Labour can be displaced
by machinery. Machines cannot work without the help of labour.
5. Wants are alternative: A want can be satisfied by two or more goods or by
two or more methods. A want for hot drink may be satisfied by coffee or tea.
We may go by ‘bus’ or ‘train’ or by ‘taxi’ to reach our destination. Thus, a want
can be satisfied by many ways. These alternative goods or methods are called
‘substitutes’.
6. Wants vary with time, place and person: Wants are not static in character.
They are changing with time, place and person. We require hot drinks in winter
and cool drinks in summer. People of England require warm woollen suits and
rain coats. People of India require only cotton. The wants of a villager in Andhra
Pradesh are different from a business magnet living in Bombay. The wants
of our forefathers were different from the wants of the present generation. So,
wants vary with generation, culture, society, geographic location and the extent of
economic development.
7. Some wants recur again: Some wants are felt again and again. The want for
food can be satisfied by eating food. Again the same want appear after a few
hours. That is why we say wants are recurring in nature.
8. Wants are influenced by advertisements: Effective advertisements through
films, journals, radio and TV will create new wants and the existing wants get
modified. Through advertisements and clever salesmanship, businessmen create
tastes for their products.
9. Wants become habits and customs: If a particular want is satisfied repeatedly
by a commodity, then it becomes a habit. Example: drinking coffee and tea.
Wants become habits and habits are responsible for wants.
Classification of Wants
In Economics, wants are classified into three categories, viz., Necessaries,
Comforts and Luxuries.
1) Necessaries
Necessaries are those which are essential for living. Man requires certain
basic things to live. He wants food, clothing and shelter. Without these things, life is
impossible.
2) Comforts
Comforts refer to those goods and services, which are not essential for
living but which are required for a happy living. A TV, a sofa-cum- bed, a cushioned 
37
revolving chair may be stated under ‘comforts’. Eating superior varieties of food may
also add to the happiness of the consumer. Example: eating fruits, drinking milk etc.
Comforts promote efficiency also.
(3) Luxuries
Those goods that are used to show off one’s higher status in life (e.g. diamond
- studded jewels) are luxuries.
Significance of Necessaries, Comforts and Luxuries
The classification of goods and services into necessaries, comforts and
luxuries are only relative in their concept. They are not absolute concepts.
What is ‘comfort’, to one may be a ‘necessity’ to another and a ‘luxury’ to a third
man. A motorcar is necessary for a businessman and a doctor. It is a luxury for a
student. What is necessary for a man in town may be a luxury for a villager. These
classifications depend on the income of a person, his social status, his tastes and
preferences.
Concept of Utility: Marshallian Approach
There are two basic approaches to the study of consumer demand theory.
The first approach is the utility approach. It involves the use of measurable (cardinal)
utility to study consumer behaviour. Marshall is the chief exponent of the utility
approach to the theory of demand. It is known as cardinal utility analysis or marginal
utility analysis or Marshallian utility analysis. The second approach is the indifference
curve approach which uses the idea of comparable utility (ordinal utility). J.R.Hicks
and R.G.D.Allen introduced the indifference curve approach.
Concept of Utility
In the ordinary language, ‘utility’ means ‘usefulness’. In Economics, utility is
defined as the power of a commodity or a service to satisfy a human want.
Utility is a subjective or psychological concept. The same commodity or
service gives different utilities to different people. For a vegetarian, mutton has no
utility. Warm clothes have little utility for the people in hot countries. So utility depends
on the consumer and his need for the commodity.
Total Utility
Total Utility refers to the sum of utilities of all units of a commodity consumed.
For example, if a consumer consumes ten biscuits, then the total utility is the sum of
satisfaction of consuming all the ten biscuits.
Marginal Utility
Marginal Utility is the addition made to the total utility by consuming one more
unit of a commodity. For example, if a consumer consumes 10 biscuits, the marginal 
38
utility is the utility derived from the 10th unit. It is nothing but the total utility of 10
biscuits minus the total utility of 9 biscuits.
Thus
 MUn = TUn
 - TU n-1
Where
MUn = Marginal Utility of ‘nth’ commodity.
TUn
 = Total Utility of n units.
TU n-1= Total Utility of n-1 units.

Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility
The law of diminishing marginal utility explains an ordinary experience of a
consumer. If a consumer takes more and more units of a commodity, the additional
utility he derives from an extra unit of the commodity goes on falling. Thus, according
to this law, the marginal utility decreases with the increase in the consumption
of a commodity. When marginal utility decreases, the total utility increases at a
diminishing rate.
Gossen, Bentham, Jevons, Karl Menger contributed initially for the
development of these ideas. But Alfred Marshall perfected these ideas and made it
as a law. This Law is also known as Gossen’s I Law.
Definition
According to Marshall, “The additional benefit which a person derives from a
given increase of his stock of a thing diminishes with every increase in the stock that
he already has”.
Assumptions of the Law
1. The units of consumption must be in standard units e.g., a cup of tea, a bottle of
cool drink etc.
2. All the units of the commodity must be identical in all aspects like taste, quality,
colour and size.
39
3. The law holds good only when the process of consumption continues without any
time gap.
4. The consumer’s taste, habit or preference must remain the same during the
process of consumption.
5. The income of the consumer remains constant.
6. The prices of the commodity consumed and its substitutes are constant.
7. The consumer is assumed to be a rational economic man. As a rational
consumer, he wants to maximise the total utility.
8. Utility is measurable.
Explanation
Suppose Mr X is hungry and eats apple one by one. The first apple gives him
great pleasure (higher utility) as he is hungry; when he takes the second apple, the
extent of his hunger will reduce. Therefore he will derive less utility from the second
apple. If he continues to take additional apples, the utility derived from the third apple
will be less than that of the second one. In this way, the additional utility (marginal
utility) from the extra units will go on decreasing. If the consumer continues to take
more apples, marginal utility falls to zero and then becomes negative.

Table 3.1 gives the utility derived by a person from successive units of
consumption of apples.
From Table 3.1 and figure 3.1 it is very clear that the marginal utility (addition
made to the total utility) goes on declining. The consumer derives 20 units of utility
from the first apple he consumes. When he consumes the apples continuously, the
marginal utility falls to 5 units for the fourth apple and becomes zero for the fifth 
40
apple. The marginal utilities are negative for the 6th and 7th apples. Thus when the
consumer consumes a commodity continuously, the marginal utility declines, reaches
zero and then becomes negative.
The total utility (sum of utilities of all the units consumed) goes on increasing
and after a certain stage begins to decline. When the marginal utility declines and
it is greater than zero, the total utility increases. For the first four units of apple, the
total utility increases from 20 units to 50 units. When the marginal utility is zero (5th
apple), the total utility is constant (50 units) and reaches the maximum. When the
marginal utility becomes negative (6th and 7th units), the total utility declines from 50
units to 45 and then to 35 units.
Importance of Law of DMU
(i) The Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility (DMU) is the foundation for various
other economic laws. For example, the Law of Demand is the result of the
operation of the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility. In other words, as more
and more units of a commodity are consumed, each of them gives less and less
marginal utility. This is due to the operation of the Law of DMU. As utility falls,
consumer is therefore willing to pay a lower price only.
(ii) The Law of DMU operates in the case of money also. A rich man already
possesses a lot of money. If more and more money is newly added to his
income, marginal utility of money begins to fall. Alfred Marshall assumed that
the marginal utility of money remains constant
(iii) This law is a handy tool for the Finance Minister for increasing tax rate on the
rich.
(iv) Producers are guided by the operation the Law of DMU, unconsciously. They
constantly change the design, the package of their goods so that the goods
become more attractive to the consumers and they appear as ‘new goods’. Or
else, the consumers would think that they are using the same commodity, over
and over. In such a situation, the Law of DMU operates in the minds of the
consumers. Demand for such commodities may fall.
Criticism
The Law of DMU is criticised on the following grounds.
(i) Deriving utility is a psychological experience, When we say a unit of X gives ten
units of utility, this means that utility can be measured precisely. In reality, utility
cannot be measured. For example, when a person sees a film and says it is
very good, we cannot measure the utility he has derived from it. However, we
can measure utility indirectly by the cinema fare he is willing to pay.
41
(ii) The Law is based on a single commodity consumption mode. That is, a
consumer consumes only one good at a time. This is an unrealistic assumption.
In real life, a consumer consumes more than one good at a time.
(iii) According to the Law, a consumer should consume successive units of the
same good continuously. In real life it is not so.
(iv) The Law assumes constancy of the marginal utility of money. This means the
marginal utility of money remains constant, even when money stock changes.
In real life, the marginal utility derived from the consumption of a good cannot
be measured precisely in monetary terms.
(v) As utility itself is capable of varying from person to person, marginal utility
derived from the consumption of a good cannot be measured precisely.
LAW OF EQUI-MARGINAL UTILITY
The idea of equi-marginal principle was first mentioned by H.H.Gossen (1810-
1858) of Germany. Hence it is called Gossen’s second Law. Alfred Marshall made
significant refinements of this law in his ‘Principles of Economics’.
The law of equi-marginal utility explains the behaviour of a consumer when
he consumes more than one commodity. Wants are unlimited but the income which
is available to the consumers to satisfy all his wants is limited. This law explains how
the consumer spends his limited income on various commodities to get maximum
satisfaction. The law of equi-marginal utility is also known as the law of substitution or
the law of maximum satisfaction or the principle of proportionality between prices and
marginal utility.
Definition
In the words of Prof. Marshall, “If a person has a thing which can be put to
several uses, he will distribute it among these uses in such a way that it has the
same marginal utility in all”.
Assumptions
1. The consumer is rational so he wants to get maximum satisfaction.
2. The utility of each commodity is measurable.
3. The marginal utility of money remains constant.
4. The income of the consumer is given.
5. The prices of the commodities are given.
6. The law is based on the law of diminishing marginal utility.
42
Explanation of the law
Suppose there are two goods X and Y on which a consumer has to spend a
given income. The consumer being rational, he will try to spend his limited income
on goods X and Y to maximise his total utility or satisfaction. Only at that point the
consumer will be in equilibrium.
According to the law of equi-marginal utility, the consumer will be in equilibrium
at the point where the utility derived from the last rupee spent on each is equal.
Symbolically the consumer will be in equilibrium when
Where MUx = Marginal utility of commodity X
 MU
y = Marginal utility of commodity Y
 Px = Price of commodity X
 P
y = Price of commodity Y
 MUm = Marginal utility of money.
They explain the marginal utility of one rupee spent on commodity X and the
marginal utility of one rupee spent on commodity Y
Let us illustrate the law of equi marginal utility with the help of the following
table:

Suppose the marginal utility of money is constant at Re 1 = 5 units, the
consumer will buy 6 units of commodity ‘x’ and 5 units of commodity ‘y’. His total
expenditure will be (Rs 5 x 6) + (Rs 4 x 5 ) = Rs 50/- on both commodities. At this
point of expenditure his satisfaction is maximised and therefore he will be in
equilibrium.

Consumer’s equilibrium is graphically portrayed in fig. 3.2. Since marginal
utility curves of goods slope downward, curves depicting will also
slope downward. Taking the income of a consumer as given, let his marginal utility of
money be constant at OM utils in Fig. 3.2. is equal to OM (the marginal utility
of money) when OH amount of good x is purchased; is equal to OM when OK
quantity of good Y is purchased. Thus, when the consumer is buying OH of X and
OK of Y, then
Therefore, the consumer will be in equilibrium when he buys OH of X and
OK of Y. No other allocation of money expenditure will yield greater utility than when
he buys OH of X and OK of Y. Suppose the money income of the consumer falls.
Then the new marginal utility of money will be equal to OM; then the consumer will
increase the purchases of good X and Y to OH and OK respectively.
Limitations of the Law
The law of equi-marginal utility bristles with the following difficulties.
1. Indivisibility of Goods
The theory is weakened by the fact that many commodities like a car, a house
etc. are indivisible. In the case of indivisible goods, the law is not applicable.
2. The Marginal Utility of Money is Not Constant
The theory is based on the assumption that the marginal utility of money is
constant. But that is not really so.
3. The Measurement of Utility is not Possible
Marshall states that the price a consumer is willing to pay for a commodity is
equal to its marginal utility. But modern economists argue that, if two persons are
paying an equal price for given commodity, it does not mean that both are getting the
same level of utility. Thus utility is a subjective concept, which cannot be measured,
in quantitative terms.
4. Utilities are Interdependent
This law assumes that commodities are independent and therefore their
marginal utilities are also independent. But in real life commodities are either
substitutes or complements. Their utilities are therefore interdependent. 
45
5. Indefinite Budget Period
According to Prof. K.E. Boulding, indefinite budget period is another difficulty
in the law. Normally the budget period is assumed to be a year. But there are certain
commodities which are available in several succeeding accounting periods. It is
difficult to calculate marginal utility for such commodities.
In conclusion, we may say all prudent and rational persons are expected to act
upon the law consciously or unconsciously. As Chapman puts it,
“We are not, of course compelled to distribute our incomes according to the
law of substitution or equi-marginal expenditure, as a stone thrown into the air is
compelled, in a sense to fall back to the earth, but as a matter of fact, we do in a
certain rough fashion, because we are reasonable.”
Importance
According to Marshall, “the applications of this principle extend over almost
every field of economic activity.”
1. It applies to consumption
Every rational human being wants to get maximum satisfaction with his
limited means. The consumer arranges his expenditure in such a way that,
 so that he will get maximum satisfaction
2. It applies to production
The aim of the producer is to get maximum output with least-cost, so that his
profit will be maximum. Towards this end, he will substitute one factor for another till
MP1 / P1
 = MPc
 / Pc
 + MPn
 / Pn
3. Distribution of Earnings Between Savings and Consumption
According to Marshall, a prudent person will endeavour to distribute his
resources between his present needs and future needs in such a way that the
marginal utility of the last rupee put in savings is equal to the marginal utility of the
last rupee spent on consumption.
4. It applies to distribution
The general theory of distribution involves the principle of substitution. In
distribution, the rewards to the various factors of production, that is their relative
shares, are determined by the principle of equi-marginal utility.
46
5. It Applies to Public Finance
The principle of ‘Maximum Social Advantage’ as enunciated by Professors
Hicks and Dalton states that, the revenue should be distributed in such a way that the
last unit of expenditure on various programmes brings equal welfare, so that social
welfare is maximised.
6. Expenditure of Time
Prof. Boulding relates Marshall’s law of equi-marginal utility to the
expenditures of limited time, i.e. twenty-four hours. He states that a person should
spend his limited time among alternative uses such as reading; studying and
gardening, in such a way that the marginal utility from all these uses are equal.
Consumer’s surplus
The concept of consumer’s surplus was first mentioned by J.A.Dupuit, a
French engineer – economist in 1844. Marshall developed the concept in his work
‘Principles of Economics’ (1890).
Consumer’s surplus is experienced in commodities which are highly useful
but relatively cheap. For example, newspaper, salt, match box, postage stamp etc.
For these commodities, we are ready to pay more than what we actually pay, if the
alternative is to go without them. The extra satisfaction a consumer derives is called
consumer’s surplus. Suppose a consumer wants to buys a shirt. He is willing to pay
Rs 250 for it. But the actual price is only Rs 200. Thus he enjoys a surplus of Rs 50.
This is called consumer’s surplus.
Definition
Marshall defines Consumer’s surplus as follows:
“The excess of price which a person would be willing to pay rather
than go without the thing, over that which he actually does pay, is the
economic measure of this surplus of satisfaction. It may be called
consumer’s surplus.”
Assumptions
1. Cardinal utility, that is, utility of a commodity is measured in money terms.
2. Marshall assumes that there is definite relationship between expected satisfaction
(utility) and realized satisfaction (actual).
3. Marginal utility of money is constant.
4. Absence of differences in income, tastes, fashion etc.
5. Independent goods and independent utilities.
47
6. Demand for a commodity depends on its price alone; it excludes other
determinants of demand.
Measurement
Consumer’s Surplus for a single commodity is measured as follows:
Consumer’s surplus = Potential price – Actual price
Potential price is the price which a consumer is willing to pay for a commodity
and actual price is the price which the consumer actually pays for that commodity.
Table 3.4
Measurement of Consumer’s Surplus
Units Marginal Utility Price of the units (in Rs) Consumer’s
surplus

2 40 10 30
3 30 10 20
4 20 10 10
5 10 10 0
150 50 100
Consumer’s surplus is determined by the potential price of the commodity
purchased and the actual price in the market price. Thus the consumer’s surplus is
the difference between the sum of marginal utilities (i.e. the total utility) minus the
total money spent (price multiplied by quantity purchased) on the commodity. This
can be illustrated by a table.
In the above table, we have assumed that the market price of the commodity
is Rs10/- (column 3). Column 2 gives the marginal utility. Marginal utility explains
the price which a consumer is willing to pay for the unit of the commodity. As more
and more units of a commodity is purchased, the marginal utility declines. Therefore
the price, which the consumer is willing to pay, also decreases. The difference
between marginal utility (potential price) and the market price (actual price) gives
the consumer’s surplus. Thus from the table consumer’s surplus for each unit is
the difference between Marginal Utility (column 2) minus market price (column 3).
The consumer’s surplus for all the units can be calculated as total utility minus the
total amount spent on the commodity i.e. consumer’s surplus = Rs 150 – 50 = Rs
100. Consumer’s surplus can be illustrated with a diagram by taking units of the
commodity on the x-axis and the utility and price on the y-axis. 
48

In the figure 3.3, MU is the marginal utility curve. OP is the price and OM is the
quantity purchased. For OM units, the consumer is willing to pay OAEM. The actual
amount he pays is OPEM. Thus consumer’s surplus is OAEM – OPEM = PAE (the
shaded area).
A rise in the market price reduces consumer’s surplus. A fall in the market
price increases the consumer’s surplus.
Criticism
Two major criticisms against the Marshallian concept of Consumer’s Surplus
are
(a) Marshall assumed that utility is measurable, but utility is immeasurable,
because it is psychological in nature;
(b) The Marshallian assumption of marginal utility of money remaining constant is
unrealistic.
This contribution of the great economist Marshall, has perhaps provoked the
most caustic of criticisms from various economists.
Marshall assumed that utility is measurable. But J.R.Hicks says that utility is
not measurable, because it is a psychological phenomenon.
1. Marshall assumed that there’s no interpersonal differences. But it will change
with regard to tastes, preferences, status etc.
2. Marshall assumed that there is constancy of marginal utility of money. But it
is unrealistic. Marginal utility of money increases with the fall in the stock of
money.
49
Importance of Consumer’s Surplus
Consumer’s Surplus is useful to the Finance Minister in formulating taxation
policies. It is also helpful in fixing a higher price by a monopolist in the market, based
on the extent of consumer’s surplus enjoyed by consumers.
Consumer’s Surplus enables comparison of the standard of living of people
of different regions or countries. This comparison helps to distinguish consumption
levels between the people, who are living in rich countries and poor countries. For
example, a middleclass person in New York enjoys more consumers’ surplus than a
similar person in Chennai. Alfred Marshall has stated that a middle class person in a
modern city enjoys more consumer’s surplus than a king of the Medieval Ages.
Indifference Curve Approach
Marshall’s demand analysis is based on the cardinal measurement of utility.
The approach is criticised for two reasons.
(i) Utility is a psychological phenomenon and
(ii) It cannot be measured.
Hence, the indifference curve approach based on ordinal ranking preference
was evolved. Vilfred Pareto, Wicksteed and Slutsky developed this approach. Two
noted English economists Prof. J.R. Hicks and Prof. Allen provided a refined version
of indifference curve approach. According to Hicks and Allen, utility cannot be
measured. It can only be ranked or ordered. The consumer can rank his preference
very easily and say which is better than the other.
The concept of scale of preference has been explained by indifference curve.
An indifference curve shows different combinations of two commodities, which give
the consumer an equal satisfaction.
Definition
An indifference curve is the locus of different combinations of two commodities
giving the same level of satisfaction.
Assumptions of indifference curve analysis
1. The consumer is rational. So, he prefers more goods to less goods.
2. He purchases two goods, X and Y only.
3. The price that a consumer pays for a commodity indicates the level of utility
derived by him.
4. His income remains constant
5. His tastes, Preference , habits remain unchanged.
50
Indifference schedule
An indifference schedule is a statement of various combinations of
two commodities that will equally be accepted by the consumer. The various
combinations give equal satisfaction to the consumer. Therefore he is indifferent
between various combinations.
Let us assume that the consumer buys two commodities - bananas and
biscuits. Then the indifference schudule will be:
Table 3.5 Indifference Schedule
Combination Biscuits (Good X) Bananas (Good Y)
A 1 12
B 2 8
C 3 5
D 4 3
E 5 2
From the above schedule it can be understood that while the number of
biscuits is increasing, the number of bananas is decreasing so that the level
of satisfaction is the same for all the combinations. Therefore the consumer is
indifferent between the combinations A, B, C, D and E.
Indifference curve
The data in the indifference schedule can be represented in the graph with
one commodity on the X-axis and another commodity in the Y-axis The various
combinations of the two commodities are plotted and joined to form a curve called
indifference curve. In the figure IC is an indifference curve showing combinations of
the two commodities given in the schedule.

Indifference Curve
All the points on this curve give equal level of satisfaction to the consumer.
Indifference curve is otherwise called ‘iso –utility curve’.
51
Indifference Map
Indifference Map is a group of indifference curves for two commodities
showing different levels of satisfaction. In this indifference map, it should be clearly
understood that a higher indifference curve denotes higher level of satisfaction and
a lower indifference curve represents lower level of satisfaction. Being rational,
the consumer will always choose a higher indifference curve to get maximum
satisfaction, other things being equal.
Properties of an Indifference curve
1. Indifference curves slope downwards to the right
2. Indifference curves are convex to the origin
3. No two indifference curves can ever cut each other.
All indifference curves slope downwards from left to right
The downward slope of indifference curve must be attributed to the fact
that the consumer is substituting good X by good Y, increases the amount of Y
and reduces the amount of X. If the indifference curve were horizontal line running
parallel to X axis then the combination which it represents is the same amount of
Y but more and more of X. In that case, the satisfaction from the combination will
not be equal. For the same reason, it can be said that indifference curve will not be
vertical.
All indifference curves are convex to the origin
This is because of the operation of a principle known as ‘Diminishing Marginal
Rate of Substitution’. The indifference curves are based on this principle. If they are
concave to the origin, then it will mean that MRS is increasing. Indifference curve
cannot be straight line except when the goods are perfect substitutes.
52
Marginal rate of substitution between X and Y referes to the amount of
commodity Y to be offered in exchange for one unit of X commodity. The MRS goes
on diminishing as consumer goes on substituting X for Y.
The third assumption is that no two indifference curves can ever cut each
other. But in Figure 3.8 we find two indifference curves do cut each other.
Point A which is on indifference curve 2 represents a higher level of
satisfaction to the consumer than at point B which is on indifference curve 1. But
point C lies on both curves. That means, two levels of satisfaction A and B which are
unequal have become equal. That cannot be accepted. So indifference curves can
never cut each other.
These are the three assumptions about the shape of an indifference curve.
53
Consumer’s Equilibrium through Indifference Curve Analysis
As a consumer has a limited income, he spends it in such a manner so as
to obtain maximum level of satisfaction. He will attain equilibrium when he gets
maximum satisfaction from his expenditure on different goods. Under the utility
analysis explained earlier, a consumer gets maximum satisfaction when marginal
utilities from his different purchases are equal. We can also explain the equilibrium
of the consumer with the help of the indifference curve analysis. For our analysis, we
have to make the following assumptions.
(a) The consumer has before him an indifference map for a pair of goods say, tea
and biscuits. This map represents the preferences of the consumer for the two
goods. It is assumed that his scales of preferences remain constant at a given
time.
(b) The consumer has a fixed amount of money to spend on the two goods. It is
assumed that he will spend the amount on both the goods and not save any
part of it.
(c) The prices of these goods are given in the market and are assumed to be
constant.
(d) The consumer is assumed to act rationally and maximise his satisfaction.
A consumer’s indifference map for good X and good Y is given in figure 3.6; it
represents four scales of preferences of a consumer for the two goods. Indifference
curves to the right represent higher satisfaction. The consumer would like to choose
a combination of good X and good Y, which will be on the highest indifference curve.
But his choice will depend upon his income and the price of the two goods.
To understand the extent of purchase of the goods with the given prices and
income of the consumer, budget line is important.
Budget line of the consumer
Suppose that the consumer has Rs.20 to spend on tea and biscuits, which
cost 50 paise and 40 paise respectively. The consumer has three alternative
possibilities before him.
(a) He may decide to buy tea only, in which case he can buy 40 cups of tea.
(b) He may decide to buy biscuits only, in which case he can buy 50 biscuits.
(c) He may decide to buy some quantity of both the goods, say 20 cups of tea
(Rs.10) and 25 biscuits (Rs.10) or 12 cups of tea (Rs.6) and 35 biscuits (Rs.14),
and so on. (Total amount = Rs.20).
54
Figure 3.9 shows the above three possibilities. The line LM represents
maximum amount of biscuits (50) and to tea (40 cups), which the consumer can buy
with his income of Rs.20. The line LM shows that the consumer cannot choose any
combination beyond this line because his income does not permit him. Nor would
he like to choose a combination below this line; say, B, as it will not represent the
maximum satisfaction
Line LM is known as the budget line since it represents the various amounts
the consumer can buy with his income; it is also known as the price-ratio line or
simply the price line since its slope represents the ratio of prices of the two goods
(i.e., OM of Good X = OL of good Y).
Figure 3.10 : Consumer's Equilibrium
The consumer gets the maximum possible satisfaction from his given income
at point C on the indifference curve I3
. At this point, he buys a combination of OX1
amount of Good X and OY1
 amount of Good Y. Any other possible combination of the
two goods will either yield lesser satisfaction or will not be unobtainable at present
prices, with the given amount of income of the consumer.
55
At the point of equilibrium (point C) the price-line LM is tangential to the
indifference curve I3
 . At point C, the indifference curve and the price-line have the
same slope.Now the slope of the indifference curve represents the marginal rate of
substitution; and the budget line shows the ratio of prices between the two goods.
At point C the marginal rate of substitution between the two goods as indicated by
the slope of the indifference curve I3
 and the ratio of prices between the two goods
as indicated by the price-line LM are equal. This point, therefore, indicates the
ideal combination between the two commodities, giving the consumer the highest
satisfaction possible with his limited income. At this point, therefore the consumer is
in equilibrium.
The fundamental condition of equilibrium is that the marginal rate of
substitution of commodity X for commodity Y should be equal to the ratio of prices
between the two goods. Therefore, the condition for equilibrium is MRS

Chapter 4
Demand and Supply
Demand for a commodity refers to the desire backed by ability to pay and
willingness to buy it. If a person below poverty line wants to buy a car, it is only a
desire but not a demand as he cannot pay for the car. If a rich man wants to buy
a car, it is demand as he will be able to pay for the car. Thus, desire backed by
purchasing power is demand.
The demand for any commodity mainly depends on the price of that
commodity. The other determinants include price of related commodities, the income
of consumers, tastes and preferences of consumers, and the wealth of consumers.
Hence the demand function can be written as
Dx = F (Px
, Ps
, Y, T, W)
where Dx
 represents demand for good x
Px is price of good X
Ps
 is price of related goods
Y is income
T refers to tastes and preferences of the consumers
W refers to wealth of the consumer.
Law of Demand
The law of demand states that there is a negative or inverse relationship
between the price and quantity demanded of a commodity over a period of time.
Definition: Alfred Marshall stated that “ the greater the amount sold, the
smaller must be the price at which it is offered, in order that it may find purchasers;
or in other words, the amount demanded increases with a fall in price and diminishes
with rise in price”. According to Ferguson, the law of demand is that the quantity
demanded varies inversely with price.
Thus the law of demand states that people will buy more at lower prices and
buy less at higher prices, other things remaining the same. By other things remaining
the same, we mean the following assumptions.
Assumptions of the Law
1. No change in the consumer’s income
2. No change in consumer’s tastes and preferences
3. No changes in the prices of other goods
59
4. No new substitutes for the goods have been discovered
5. People do not feel that the present fall in price is a prelude to a further decline in
price.
Demand Schedule
Demand schedule is a tabular statement showing how much of a commodity is
demanded at different prices.
Demand Schedule and Demand curve
Table 4.1 is a hypothetical demand schedule of an individual consumer. It
shows a list of prices and corresponding quantities demanded by an individual
consumer. This is an individual demand schedule.

Demand Curve
The demand schedule can be converted into a demand curve by measuring
price on vertical axis and quantity on horizontal axis as shown in Figure 4.1.
In Figure, 4.1 DD1
 is the demand curve. The curve slopes downwards from
left to right showing that, when price rises, less is demanded and vice versa. Thus
the demand curve represents the inverse relationship between the price and quantity
demanded, other things remaining constant.
Why does the demand curve slope downwards?
The demand curve slopes downwards mainly due to the law of diminishing
marginal utility. The law of diminishing marginal utility states that an additional unit of
a commodity gives a lesser satisfaction. Therefore, the consumer will buy more only
at a lower price. The demand curve slopes downwards because the marginal utility
curve also slopes downwards.
60
Individual demand and market demand schedules
Individual demand schedule tells the quantities demanded by an individual
consumer at different prices.
Table 4.2 : Individual demand schedule for oranges
Price of oranges (Rs.) Quantity of oranges

It is clear from the schedule that when the price of orange is Rs.5/ - the
consumer demands just one orange. When the price falls to Rs.4 he demands 2
oranges. When the price fals further to Rs 3, he demands 3 oranges. Thus, when the
price of a commodity falls, the demand for that commodity increases and vice versa.
Market demand schedule
A demand schedule for a market can be constructed by adding up demand
schedules of the individual consumers in the market. Suppose that the market for
oranges consists of 2 consumers. The market demand is calculated as follows.

Market demand curve
The market demand also increases with a fall in price and vice versa.
In Figure 4.2, the quantity demanded by consumer I and consumer II are
measured on the horizontal axis and the market price is measured on the vertical
axis. The total demand of these two consumers i.e. D1
 + D2
 = DD M. - DDM – the
market demand curve - also slopes downwards just like the individual demand
curve. Like normal demand curvs, it is convex to the origin. This reveals the inverse
relationship.

Exceptions to the Law of Demand
The Law of demand is a general statement telling that prices and quantities
of a commodity are inversely related. There are certain peculiar cases in which the
law of demand will not hold good. In those cases, more will be demanded at a higher
price and less will be demanded at a lower price. The demand curves in those cases
slope upwards showing a positive relationship between price and quantity demanded
as shown in figure 4.3.

When the price increases from OP to OP1
, quantity demanded also increases
from OQ to OQ1 and vice versa. DD is the exceptional or abnormal demand curve.
The following is the list of few exceptions to the law of demand.
(1) Veblen Effect
Veblen has pointed out that there are some goods demanded by very rich
people for their social prestige. When price of such goods rise, their use becomes
more attractive and they are purchased in larger quantities. Demand for diamonds
from the richer class will go up if there is increase in price. If such goods were
cheaper, the rich would not even purchase.
62
(2) Giffen Paradox
Sir Robert Giffen discovered that the poor people will demand more of inferior
goods if their prices rise and demand less if their prices fall. Inferior goods are
those goods which people buy in large quantities when they are poor and in small
quantities when they become rich. For example, poor people spend the major part of
their income on coarse grains (e.g. ragi, cholam ) and only a small part on rice. When
the price of coarse grains rises, they will buy less rice. To fill up the resulting gap,
more of coarse grains have to be purchased. Thus, rise in the price of coarse grains
results in the increase in quantity of coarse grains purchased. This is called ‘Giffen
Paradox’. In these cases, the law of demand has an exception.
Changes in demand
Extension and contraction of demand
The demand curve does not change its position here. When change in
demand for a commodity is entirely due to a change in its price, it is called extension
or contraction of demand. The extension or contraction in demand are movements on
or along the given demand curve. It is shown in figure 4.4.

When the price of a good is OP, demand is OQ. If the price of good falls
to OP2
, demand expands to OQ1
. Thus extension in demand is QQ1
 . On the
other hand, when the price of good rises to OP1
 demand contracts to OQ2
. Thus
contraction in demand is QQ2
.
Shifts in demand or Increase and decrease in demand
One of the basic assumptions of economic theory is ‘other things being equal’.
Other things are income, tastes, population, government policy, technology, price of
related goods etc. Change in such factors will bring about increase or decrease in
demand. In figure 4.5, the increase in demand is shown by the shifts of the demand

Factors determining demand
1. Tastes and preferences of the consumer
Demand for a commodity may change due to a change in tastes, preferences
and fashion. For example, the demand for dhoties has come down and demand for
trouser cloth and jeans has gone up due to change in fashion.
2. Income of the consumer
When the income of the consumer increases, more will be demanded.
Therefore, we can say that as income increases, other things being equal, the
demand for a commodity also increases. Comforts and luxuries belong to this
category.
3. Price of substitutes
Some goods can be substituted for other goods. For example, tea and coffee
are substitutes. If the price of coffee increases while the price of tea remains the
same, there will be increase in the demand for tea and decrease in the demand for
coffee. The demand for substitutes moves in the opposite direction.
4. Number of consumers
Size of population of a country is an important determinant of demand. For
instance, larger the population, more will be the demand, for certain goods like food
grains, and pulses etc. When the number of consumers increases, there will be
greater demand for goods.
64
5. Expectation of future price change
If the consumer believes that the price of a commodity will rise in the future,
he may buy a larger quantity in the present. Suppose he expects the price to fall, he
may defer some of his purchases to a future date.
6. Distribution of income
Distribution of income affects consumption pattern and hence the demand
for various goods. If the government attempts redistribution of income to make it
equitable, the demand for luxuries will decline and the demand for necessities of life
will increase.
7. Climate and weather conditions
Demand for a commodity may change due to a change in climatic conditions.
For example, during summer, demand for cool drinks, cotton clothes and air
conditioners will increase. In winter, demand for woollen clothes increases.
8. State of business
During boom, demand will expand and during depression demand will
contract.
9. Consumer Innovativeness
When the price of wheat flour or price of electricity falls, the consumer
identifies new uses for the product. It creates new demand for the product.
Elasticity of Demand
The law of demand explains that demand will change due to a change in the
price of the commodity. But it does not explain the rate at which demand changes to
a change in price. The concept of elasticity of demand measures the rate of change
in demand.
The concept of elasticity of demand was introduced by Alfred Marshall.
According to him “the elasticity (or responsiveness) of demand in a market is great or
small according as the amount demanded increases much or little for a given fall in
price, and diminishes much or little for a given rise in price”.
Types of Elasticity of Demand
There are three types of elasticity of demand;
1. Price elasticity of demand;
2. Income elasticity of demand; and
3. Cross-elasticity of demand
65
1. Price elasticity of demand
“The degree of responsiveness of quantity demanded to a change in price is
called price elasticity of demand”

Measurement of price elasticity of demand
Important methods for calculating price elasticity of demand are
1) Percentage method
2) Point method or slope method
3) Total outlay method
4) Arc method
1. Percentage method
This is measured as the relative change in demand divided by relative change
in price (or) percentage change in demand divided by percentage change in price.
 %∆q Formula is e
p = % ∆p
For example, the price of rice rises by 10% and the demand for rice falls by 15%
Then ep = 15/10 = 1.5
This means that the demand for rice is elastic.
If the demand falls to 5% for a 10% rise in price, then ep = 5/10 = 0.5. This
means that the demand for rice is inelastic. Thus there are five measures of elasticity.
a) Relatively Elastic demand, if the value of elasticity is greater than 1
b) Relatively Inelastic demand, if the value of elasticity is less than 1
c) Unitary elastic demand, if the value of elasticity is equal to 1.
d) Perfectly inelastic demand, if the value of elasticity is zero.
e) Perfectly elastic demand, if the value of elasticity is infinity.

3. Total outlay method:
We can measure elasticity through a change in expenditure on commodities
due to a change in price.
1. Demand is elastic, if total outlay or expenditure increases for a fall in price (ep
 >
1).
2. Demand is inelastic, if total outlay or expenditure falls for a fall in price (ep
 < 1).
3. Elasticity of demand is unitary, if total expenditure does not change for a fall in
price (e p
= 1).
The results are tabulated in Table 4.6:

Cross-elasticity of demand
The responsiveness of demand to changes in prices of related goods is called
cross-elasticity of demand (related goods may be substitutes or complementary
goods). In other words, it is the responsiveness of demand for commodity x to the
change in the price of commodity y.
The relationship between x and y commodities may be substitutive as in the
case of tea and coffee (or) complementary as in the case of pen and ink 
70
Measures of cross-elasticity of demand
Infinity - Commodity x is nearly a perfect substitute for commodity y
Zero - Commodities x and y are not related.
Negative - Commodities x and y are complementary.
Factors determining elasticity of demand: The elasticity of demand depends on
1. nature of the commodity, 2. uses of commodity, 3. existence of substitutes, 4.
postponement of demand, 5. amount of money spent, 6. habits and 7. range of prices
of commodity.
Importance of Elasticity of demand
1. Price discrimination
If the demand for a product has different elasticities in different markets, then
the monopolist can fix different prices in different markets. This price discrimination is
possible due to different price elasticities
2. Levy of taxes
The government will get higher revenue if tax is increased on goods having
inelastic demand. Conversely, the government, will get lower revenue if tax is
increased on goods having elastic demand.
3. International Trade
Terms of trade refer to the rate at which domestic commodities are exchanged
for foreign commodities. The terms of trade will be favourable to a country if its
exports enjoy inelastic demand in the world market.
4. Determination of volume of output
Volume of goods and services must be produced in accordance with the
demand for the commodity. When the demand is inelastic, the producer will produce
more goods to take the advantage of higher prices. Hence the nature of elastic and
inelastic demand helps in the determination of the volume of output.
5. Fixation of wages for labourers
If the demand for workers is inelastic, efforts of trade unions to raise wages of
the workers will be successful. On the other hand, if the demand for labour is elastic,
they may not succeed in increasing the wage rate by trade union activity.
6. Poverty in the midst of plenty
The concept of elasticity of demand explains the paradox of poverty i.e. poverty in
the midst of plenty. For example, bumper crop of food grains should bring agricultural
prosperity but if the demand for food grains is inelastic, the agriculturist will be the
loser if low price is paid.
71
LAW OF SUPPLY
Supply means the goods offered for sale at a price during a specific period of
time. It is the capacity and intention of the producers to produce goods and services
for sale at a specific price.
The supply of a commodity at a given price may be defined as the amount of it
which is actually offered for sale per unit of time at that price.
The law of supply establishes a direct relationship between price and supply.
Firms will supply less at lower prices and more at higher prices. “Other things
remaining the same, as the price of commodity rises, its supply expands and as the
price falls, its supply contracts”.
Supply schedule and supply curve
A supply schedule is a statement of the various quantities of a given
commodity offered for sale at various prices per unit of time. With the help of the
supply schedule, a supply curve can be drawn.
Individual supply schedule and curve
Individual supply schedule is a list of prices and quantities of a given
commodity offered for sale by an individual seller or producer.
Table 4.7 Supply Schedule of A

10 12
With the help of the supply schedule, we can construct supply curve. On the
basis of the schedule, supply curve SS is drawn. It has a positive slope. It moves
upward to the right. The price of the product and quantity supplied are directly related
to each other.
Market supply schedule and curve
By adding up the quantity supplied at various prices by all sellers in the
market, we can get market supply schedule
Market supply curve is the lateral summation of the individual supply curves of
all the producers in the market.

Movement along the supply curve or expansion and contraction of
supply curve
When more units are supplied at a higher price, it is called ‘expansion of
supply’. When fewer units are supplied at a lower price it is called ‘contraction in
supply’. It is illustrated in figure 4.14.

When the price is OP, OA is supplied. When price increases to OP1
 the
producer will supply OB units. The movement from OA to OB shows the expansion in
supply.
Original price is OP and original supply is OA. When price falls to OP2
 the
producer will supply OC units. The supply has contracted from OA to OC.
Shifts in supply (or) increase or decrease in supply
Increase or decrease in supply causes shifts in the supply curve. A shift in
the supply curve is due to a change in other factors i.e., other than the price of the
commodity. It is explained in the figure 4.15.
At price OP, SS is the supply curve before the change in other factors. S1

Factors determining supply
1. Production technology
State of production technology affects the supply function. If advanced
technology is used in the country, large scale production is possible. Hence supply
will increase. Old technology will not increase the supply.
2. Prices of factors
When the prices of factors rise, cost of production will increase. This will result
in a decrease in supply.
3. Prices of other products
Any change in the prices of other products will influence the supply. An
increase in the price of other products will influence the producer to shift the
production in favour of that product. Supply of the original product will be reduced.
4. Number of producers or firms
If the number of producers producing the product increases, the supply of the
product will increase in the market.
5. Future price expectations
If producers expect that there will be a rise in the prices of products in future,
they will not supply their products at present.
6. Taxes and subsidies
If tax is imposed by the government on the inputs of a commodity, cost of
production will go up. Supply will be reduced. When subsidy is given to the producer,
it will encourage them to produce and supply more. Subsidy means a part of the cost
of a commodity will be borne by the government.
7. Non-economic factors
Non-economic factors like, war, political climate and natural calamities create
scarcity in supply.
Elasticity of Supply
The law of supply tells us that quantity supplied will respond to a change in
price. The concept of elasticity of supply explains the rate of change in supply as a
result of change in price. It is measured by the formula mentioned below
74
Elasticity of supply may be defined as “the degree of responsiveness of
change in supply to change in price on the part of sellers”.
Types of elasticity of supply
There are five types of elasticity of supply.
1. Perfectly elastic supply
The coefficient of elasticity of supply is infinity. (es
 is ∝). For a small change or
no change in price, there will be infinite amount of supply. (SS1
 in Figure 4.16)
2. Relatively elastic supply
The coefficient of elastic supply is greater than 1(es
 > 1). Quantity supplied
changes by a larger percentage than price. (SS2
 in figure 4.16)
3. Unitary elastic supply
The coefficient of elastic supply is equal to 1 (es
 = 1). A change in price will
cause a proportionate change in quantity supplied. (SS3
 in figure 4.16)
4. Relatively inelastic supply
The coefficient of elasticity is less than one (es
 < 1). Quantity supplied changes
by a smaller percentage than price. (SS4
 in the figure 4.16)
5. Perfectly inelastic supply
The coefficient of elasticity is equal to zero (es
 = 0). A change in price will not
bring about any change in quantity supplied. (SS5
 in figure 4.16)

Chapter 5
Equilibrium Price
We have discussed in the last chapter demand and supply. The demand curve
reflects the price-quantity relationship and exhibits the different pairs of price-quantity
preferred by the consumers. Similarly the supply curve exhibits the preferences of
firms for different pairs of price-quantity. The preferences of consumers (buyers) and
firms (sellers) are opposed to each other. It is also evident enough from the shape of
demand and supply curves. What will be the actual price charged and quantity sold in
a particular market?
There is only one price at which the preferences of sellers and buyers
meet together. At that point the quantity demanded of a commodity by the buyer
is equivalent to the quantity the seller is willing to sell. This price is called as the
equilibrium price and it occurs at the point of intersection of the supply curve and the
demand curve. In other words, equilibrium refers to a particular pair of prices and
quantity. The supply and the demand will be in balance in equilibrium.
Equilibrium in general is defined as the state of rest or balance from which
there is no tendency for change. In economics, equilibrium normally refers to
equilibrium in a market. Even if there is any change, the original equilibrium position
will be restored by market forces. The concept of equilibrium is also applied to
describe and understand other sub-systems of the economy like agriculture, industry,
growth and distribution.

PE - equilibrium price ( or price of market balance)
D>S - Excess of demand - when P<PE
S>D - Excess of supply - when P> PE
Market equilibrium can also be illustrated with help of Figure 5.1. Equilibrium
price is PE . At price PE , the quantity demanded is equal to quantity supplied, D=S. At
other prices, there is no equality between quantity demanded and quantity supplied.
In both the cases either the consumer or the firms are dissatisfied and tend to
change the price.
At any price above the equilibrium price (PE), supply is greater than
demand(S>D). Thus there is excess supply. When price is high, buyers prefer
to reduce their purchase. But sellers prefer to sell more as price is high. These
contrasting behaviours of buyers and sellers result in excess supply in the market
which is the difference between the quantities demanded and quantity supplied. As
sellers cannot sell all of the quantity at the high price, some of them may reduce price
to sell the excess stocks.
For instance, price “discounts” are advertised by sellers in the name of ‘annual
stock clearance’ sales. When one seller offers discount, the other sellers also follow
suit by cutting their prices. As a result, the market price as a whole will decline till the
excess supply is sold and equilibrium is (D=S) restored.
Similarly, if the price is below the equilibrium price PE, there will be excess
demand, D>S. In this case some of the buyers may try to bid up the price to buy
some more quantity when supply is less. This may also encourage sellers to supply
more. For instance, buying cinema tickets off the counter (called as tickets in black)
by paying a higher price than the actual price.
Thus, in both cases, the actions of buyers and sellers will move the price
either upwards or downwards and eliminate the excess demand or excess
supply. Such actions also restore the demand-supply balance to attain the market
equilibrium. At equilibrium price, there is no force to change the price or quantity
demanded of a commodity.
Figure 5.1 illustrates the market in equilibrium at the equality between demand
and supply. In case of any deviation from the equilibrium price, the direction of price
movement is shown by the arrow marks. When there is excess supply, price has a
downward tendency. In the case of excess demand, price has an upward tendency.
At equilibrium, price is stable because there is no tendency for change as D=S.
80
Shift in Demand and Supply
The market equilibrium attained above is temporary. It cannot be retained for
a long period. It is because demand and supply conditions keep changing frequently.
Such changes occur due to many variables other than price. These changes occur
independently of price. We will see the causes and nature of such changes that
influence demand and supply.
We have already seen that price is the main factor affecting demand and
supply keeping ‘other things’ constant. What are the ‘other things’? Suppose, those
‘other things’ are not constant but changing, what will happen to demand and supply?
Note that any change in these determinants of demand and supply will shift the
demand curve and supply curve. These shifts will also bring new equilibrium.
Shift in Demand
The ‘other things’ that affect demand are also called as the determinants of
demand. They include income of the consumer, tastes, prices of substitutes and
many more. Changes in these determinants will change demand independently of
price. If income of the consumer increases, they will buy more irrespective of the
price. Similarly a fall in income will bring a fall in demand even if there is no change in
price.

In Figure 5.2, D is the original demand curve with equilibrium price P and
quantity Q. Any change in the determinants of demand like income and tastes will
shift the demand curve. For instance, a fall in the income of consumer shifts the
demand curve D to D1
 and the new equilibrium would be at point E1
.Similarly, any
increase in income shifts the demand curve from D to D2
 . The equilibrium also
moves from point E1
 to E2
 . 
81
Note the distinction between changes in quantity demanded and change
in demand. Changes in quantity demanded occur only when there is change in the
price. Thus the change in the price-quantity schedule brings movements on the
demand curve whereas the changes in the other determinants (namely income,
tastes, prices of substitutes, etc) shift the demand curve as a whole.

Shifts in Supply
As seen earlier, the supply curve shows the relationship between the price and
quantity supplied keeping the ‘other things’ constant. The ‘other things’ which affect
supply include number of sellers in the market, factor prices, etc. These factors affect
quantity supplied independently of price.
Price is the major determinant of supply. However, a fall in the price of factor
(s) of production (land and labour) will reduce the cost of production. This in turn will
encourage the firms to supply more. This will cause the shift of supply curve from
its original level of S to new level of S1
. On the other hand, an increase in factor
price will increase the cost of production and the supply curve will shift from S to S2
.
In these two situations S1
 and S2 , equilibrium point also moves from E to E1
 or E2
respectively
Just like demand, the distinction between the change in quantity supplied and
change in supply needs to be noted. A change in the quantity supplied occurs only
due to change in price whereas the change in the ‘determinants’ of supply such as
factor price will shift the entire supply curve and a new equilibrium will be attained.
Such shifts will take place independently of price. 
82
Time Periods and Price Fixation
Time Element
Time element plays an important role in economics. Modern economists divide
time periods into short period and long period. The equilibrium price acquired above
is valid only for a particular time period. Any change in demand and supply over a
period of time will shift the demand and supply curves and different equilibrium will be
obtained.
For instance, the flexibility of a firm in adjusting its production to meet the
change in demand depends on the nature of its inputs. There are two types of inputs
namely fixed inputs and variable inputs.
The fixed input is one whose quantity cannot be adjusted in a limited time
period. Heavy machinery, buildings and capital equipments are such fixed inputs and
they may need more time for installation or replacement.
However, variable inputs like labour, raw materials and electricity can be
changed quickly to change the supply until the full plant capacity is reached. Now it is
possible to distinguish between short period and long period. The short period for a
firm is the time period during which at least one of the inputs is fixed input. The long
period is the time period during which all the inputs are variable inputs.
The specific duration of the short period and long period will vary from firm
to firm. A small Bonda stall on the roadside pavements can change all the inputs
even within a single day, because all inputs are easily variable. The seller can install
one more stove, use more oil and other ingredients of Bonda within a day to meet
any sudden increase in demand. Hence, for him the duration of long period can
even be a single day. On the other hand, installation of a specialized machinery for
the Ariyalur cement plant may take years, because the production, transportation,
installation require a long period of time.
Price Fixation in the Short Period
Alfred Marshall introduced time element in the determination of equilibrium
and divided them into market period, short period and long period.
Market Period
Market period is the period during which the ability of the firms to affect any
changes in supply in response to any change in demand is extremely limited or
almost nil. Thus supply is more or less fixed in the market period without any change.
However, the demand may vary during this period.
The equilibrium price will be determined according to the changes in demand,
given the fixed supply. Figure 5.4 explains the equilibrium price in market period.

Market Period
As the supply is fixed in the market period, it is shown as a vertical line SMP.
It is also called as inelastic supply curve. When demand increases from DD to D1
D1
,
price increases from P to P1
. Similarly, a fall in demand from DD to D2
D2
 pull the
price down from P to P2
. The market for perishables can be a good illustration. The
demand for plantain fruits increases during the festival season, so the prices will
naturally go up as the supply cannot be increased immediately to meet the demand.
Thus, demand determines the equilibrium price in the market period.
Short period
As mentioned earlier short period is the one during which at least one of the
factors will be a fixed input and the supply will be adjusted by changing the variable
inputs. The equilibrium price will be determined by adjusting supply (within the plant
capacity) according to the changes in demand (Figure 5.5)

sp is elastic implying that supply can be increased by changing the variable
input. Note that the corresponding increase in price from P to P1
 for a given increase
in demand from D to D1 is less than that of the market period. It is because, increase
in demand is partially met by the increase in supply from q to q1
 . Thus during
the short period both demand and supply exert their influence on price and the
equilibrium price is determined accordingly.
Long Period
In the long period supply can be changed by changing all the inputs (both the
fixed and variable inputs). Any amount of change in demand will be met by changing
the supply, to the extent of changing the plant, machinery and the quantum of
technology. In figure 5.6, the long period supply curve SLP is more elastic and flatter
than that of the SSP. This implies the greater extent of flexibility of the firms to change
the supply. The price increases from P to P2
 in response to an increase in demand
from D to D1 and it is less than that of the market period (P1
) and short period (P2
).
It is because the increase in demand is fully met by the required increase in supply.
Hence, supply plays a significant role in determining the lower equilibrium price in the
long run.

Chapter 6
Production
Meaning of Production
Production in Economics refers to the creation of those goods and services
which have exchange value. It means the creation of utilities. These utilities are in the
nature of form utility, time utility and place utility. Creation of such utilities results in
the overall increase in the production and redistribution of goods and services in the
economy. Utility of a commodity may increase due to several reasons.
Form Utility
If the physical form of a commodity is changed, its utility may increase. For
instance, the utility of cotton increases, if it is converted into clothes. The other
examples are processing of paddy into rice, wheat into flour and butter into ghee.
Place Utility
If a commodity is transported from one place to another, its utility may
increase. For instance, if rice is transported from Tamil Nadu to Kerala, its utility will
be more.
Time Utility
If the commodity is stored for future usage, its utility may increase. During
rainy season, water is stored in reservoirs and it is used at a later time. This
increases the utility of that stored water. Agricultural commodities like paddy, wheat,
oilseeds, pulses are stored for the regular uses of consumers throughout the year.
Possession Utility
Commodities in the transaction process, change from one person to another
person. Commodities in the hands of producers have some utility and by the time
they reach consumers through the traders their utility is increased. Such utility due to
possession or transfer of ownership of the commodity is called, possession utility. For
example, paddy in the hands of producers, i.e. farmers has less utility compared to
that of the rice in the hands of consumers.
Factors of production
Human activity can be broken down into two components, production and
consumption. When there is production, a process of transformation takes place.
Inputs are converted into an output. The inputs are classified and referred to as land,
labour, and capital. Collectively the inputs are called factors of production.
When the factors of production are combined in order to produce something,
a fourth factor is required. Goods and services do not produce themselves but need 
89
some conscious thought process in order to plan and implement manufacture. This
thought process is often called entrepreneurship or organisation.
Factors of production refer to those goods and services which help in the
productive process.
Kinds of factors of production
Factors of production are broadly classified into primary factors and derived
factors. Man (Labour) acts upon Nature (Land) to produce goods and services and
wealth. These two factors (Land and Labour) are naturally given and without them no
goods can be produced. These are called primary factors.
Capital and organisation are derived from the primary factors of production,
and are called derived factors of production. These derived factors of production,
when combined with the primary factors of production, raise total production.
According to the traditional classification, there are four factors of production.
They are Land, Labour, Capital and Organisation.
Land
Land as a factor of production refers to all those natural resources or gifts of
nature which are provided free to man. It includes within itself several things such as
land surface, air, water, minerals, forests, rivers, lakes, seas, mountains, climate and
weather. Thus, ‘Land’ includes all things that are not made by man.
Characteristics or Peculiarities of land
(i) Land is a free gift of nature
(ii) Land is fixed (inelastic) in supply.
(iii) Land is imperishable
(iv) Land is immobile
(v) Land differs in fertility and situation
(vi) Land is a passive factor of production
As a gift of nature, the initial supply price of land is zero. However, when used
in production, it becomes scarce. Therefore, it fetches a price, accordingly.
Labour
Labour is the human input into the production process. Alferd Marshall defines
labour as ‘the use or exertion of body or mind, partly or wholly, with a view to secure
an income apart from the pleasure derived from the work’.
90
Characteristics or Peculiarities of labour
(i) Labour is perishable.
(ii) Labour is an active factor of production. Neither land nor capital can yield much
without labour.
(iii) Labour is not homogeneous. Skill and dexterity vary from person to person.
(iv) Labour cannot be separated from the labourer.
(v) Labour is mobile. Man moves from one place to another from a low paid
occupation to a high paid occupation.
(vi) Individual labour has only limited bargaining power. He cannot fight with his
employer for a rise in wages or improvement in work- place conditions. However,
when workers combine to form trade unions, the bargaining power of labour
increases.
Labour can assume several forms. Digging earth, breaking stones, carrying
loads comprise simple labour operations but labour also covers highly qualified and
skilled managers, engineers and technicians.
Division of Labour
The concept ‘Division of Labour’ was introduced by Adam Smith in his book
‘An Enquiry into The Nature and Causes of Wealth of Nations’.
Meaning of Division of Labour
Division of Labour means dividing the process of production into distinct and
several component processes and assigning each component in the hands of a
labour or a set of labourers, who are specialists in that particular process.
For example, a tailor stitches a shirt in full. In the case of garment exporters,
cutting of cloth, stitching of hands, body, collars, holes for buttons, stitching of
buttons, etc., are done independently by different workers. Therefore, they are
combining the parts into a whole shirt.
A tailor may stitch a maximum of four shirts a day. In the case of garment
exports firm, it may stitch more than 100 shirts a day. Thus, division of labour results
in increased production.
Division of Labour and Market
It is stated “Division of Labour is limited by the extent of market”. When
markets for a commodity grows from local to national and national to international,
producers of that commodity divide and subdivide the processes of its production into
finer and finer divisions of labour. Each sub-division is assigned to a particular set of
specialist workers. As a result, production rises enormously.
91
Merits of Division of Labour
1. Division of labour improves efficiency of labour when labour repeats
doing the same tasks.
2. Facilitates the use of machinery in production, resulting in inventions. e.g.
More’s telegraphic codes.
3. Time and materials are put to the best and most efficient use.
Demerits of Division of Labour
The demerits of Division of Labour are:
1. Repetition of the same task makes labour to feel that the work is monotonous
and stale. It kills the humanity in him.
2. Narrow specialisation reduces the possibility of labour to find alternative
avenues of employment. This results in increased unemployment.
3. Kills the growth of handicrafts and the worker loses the satisfaction of having
made a commodity in full.
Capital
Capital is the man made physical goods used to produce other goods and
services. In the ordinary language, capital means money. In Economics, capital refers
to that part of man-made wealth which is used for the further production of wealth.
According to Marshall, “Capital consists of those kinds of wealth other than free gifts
of nature, which yield income”.
Money is regarded as capital because it can be used to buy raw materials,
tools, implements and machinery for production. The terms capital and wealth are not
synonymous. Capital is that part of wealth which is used for the further production of
wealth. Thus, all wealth is not capital but all capital is wealth.
Forms of Capital
1. Physical Capital or Material Resources
2. Money Capital or Monetary Resources, and
3. Human Capital or Human Resources
1. Physical Capital
All man-made physical assets like plant and machinery, tools, buildings, roads,
dams and communication, etc., are the various forms of physical capital.
92
Characteristics of Physical capital
(a) It is an asset which has a specific life period.
(b) Physical capital asset can be used in production again and again. As a result, it
undergoes wear and tear or depreciation.
(c) When used in production, it gives a series of annual income flows called
annuities, during its life period.
Accumulation of more and more physical capital is called physical capital formation
2. Money Capital
The investment that is made in the form of money or monetary instruments
is called money capital. A household saves its income in the form of bank deposits,
shares and securities or other monetary instruments. These are the sources of
money capital.
3. Human Capital
Human capital refers to the quality of labour resources, which can be improved
through investments in education, training, and health. Higher the investments in
human capital, higher will be the productivity.
Characteristics of capital
(i) Capital is a passive factor of production
(ii) Capital is man-made
(iii) Capital is not an indispensable factor of production, i.e. Production is possible
even without capital
(iv) Capital has the highest mobility
(v) Supply of capital is elastic
(vi) Capital is productive
(vii) Capital lasts over time (A plant may be in operation for a number of years)
(viii) Capital involves present sacrifice (cost) to get future benefits.
Organisation or entrepreneurship
An entrepreneur is a person who combines the different factors of production
(land, labour and capital), in the right proportion and initiates the process of
production and also bears the risk involved in it. The entrepreneur is also called
‘organiser’. Entrepreneurship is risk taking, managerial, and organizational skills
needed to produce goods and services in order to gain a profit. In modern times, an
entrepreneur is called ‘the changing agent of the society’. He is not only responsible
for producing the socially desirable output but also to increase the social welfare.
93
Functions of an Entrepreneur
1. Identifying Profitable Investible Opportunities
Conceiving a new and most promising and profitable idea or capturing a
new idea available in the market is the foremost function of an entrepreneur. This is
known as identifying profitable investible opportunities.
2. Deciding the size of unit of production
An entrepreneur has to decide the size of the unit – whether big or small
depending upon the nature of the product and the level of competition in the market.
3. Deciding the location of the production unit
A rational entrepreneur will always locate his unit of production nearer to both
factor market and the end-use market. This is to be done in order to bring down
the delay in production and distribution of products and to reduce the storage and
transportation cost.
4. Identifying the optimum combination of factors of production
The entrepreneur, after having decided to start a new venture, takes up the
task of hiring factors of production. Further, he decides in what combinations he
should combine these factors so that maximum output is produced at minimum cost.
5. Making innovations
According to Schumpeter, basically an entrepreneur is an innovator of new
markets and new techniques of production. A new market increases the sales volume
whereas a new cost cutting production technique will make the product cheaper. This
will in turn increase the volume of sales and the profit.
6. Deciding the reward payment
The factors used in production have to be rewarded on the basis of their
productivity. Measuring the productivity of the factors and the payment of reward is
the crucial function of an entrepreneur.
7. Taking Risks and facing uncertainties
According to Hawley, a business is nothing but a bundle of risks. Products are
produced for future demand. The future is uncertain. The investments are made in
the present. This is the serious risk in production. One who is ready to accept the risk
becomes a successful entrepreneur. A prudent entrepreneur forecasts the future risks
scientifically and take appropriate decision in the present to overcome such risks.
According to Knight one of the important functions of entrepreneur is uncertaintybearing.
94
Production Function
The functional relationship between inputs and outputs is known as production
function. Inputs refer to the factor services which are used in production i.e. land,
labour, capital and enterprise. Output refers to the volume of goods produced.
Given technical conditions, the production function shows how a certain amount of
inputs will result in the production of a certain amount of output of a commodity. The
production function is given as
Q = f (x1
, x2
, x 3
….xn
 ) in which
Q is the quantity produced during a given period of time and x1
, x2, x3 ….xn
are the quantities of different factors used in production. The production function
explains how the output can be maximised with the help of given inputs.
To understand the different stages of the production functions, it is essential to
understand the relationship between (i) Marginal Product and Total Product and (ii)
Marginal Product and Average Product (Refer Table 6.1 and Figure 6.1)
Relationship between Marginal Product and Total Product
(i) When marginal product is positive, the total product increases
a. When marginal product increases, the total product will be increasing at an
increasing rate
b. When marginal product remains constant, the total product will be increasing
at a constant rate
c. When marginal product decreases but is positive, the total product will be
increasing at a decreasing rate
(ii) When marginal product is zero, the total product reaches the maximum
and remains constant
(iii) When marginal product is negative, the total product decreases.
Production function may be classified into two:
1. Short-run production function which is studied through Law of Variable
Proportions
2. Long-run production function which is explained by Returns to Scale
Short-run production function - The law of variable proportions
The law examines the relationship between one variable factor and output,
keeping the quantities of other factors fixed.
95
Definition
As the proportion of one factor in a combination of factors is increased, after a
point, first the marginal and then the average product of that factor will diminish.
Assumptions of the law
The law is based on the following assumptions
(i) Only one factor is made variable and other factors are kept constant.
(ii) This law does not apply in case all factors are proportionately varied. i.e.
where the factors must be used in rigidly fixed proportions to yield a product.
(iii) The variable factor units are homogenous i.e. all the units of variable factors
are of equal efficiency.
(iv) Input prices remain unchanged
(v) The state of technology does not change or remains the same at a given
point of time.
(vi) The entire operation is only for short-run, as in the long-run all inputs are
variable.
Three stages of law
The behaviour of the output when the varying quantity of one factor is
combined with a fixed quantity of the other can be divided into three stages. They are

(i) Increasing returns stage
(ii) Decreasing returns stage
(iii) Negative returns stage
The three stages could be better understood by the following Table 6.1 and
figure 6.1
Stage I: Stage of increasing returns
Stage I ends where the average product reaches its highest (maximum) point.
During this stage, the total product, the average product and the marginal product are
increasing. It is notable that the marginal product in this stage increases but in a later
part it starts declining. Though marginal product starts declining, it is greater than the
average product so that the average product continues to rise.
Stage II: Stage of decreasing returns
Stage II ends at the point where the marginal product is zero. In the second
stage, the total product continues to increase but at a diminishing rate. The marginal
product and the average product are declining but are positive. At the end of the
second stage, the total product is maximum and the marginal product is zero.
Stage III: Stage of negative returns
In this stage the marginal product becomes negative. The total product and
the average product are declining.
The stage of Operation
In stage I the fixed factor is too much in relation to the variable factor.
Therefore in stage I, marginal product of the fixed factor is negative. On the other
hand, in stage III the marginal product of the variable factor is negative. Therefore a
rational producer will not choose to produce in stages I and III. He will choose only 
97
the second stage to produce where the marginal product of both the fixed factor and
variable factor are positive. At this stage the total product is maximum. The particular
point at which the producer will decide to produce in this stage depends upon the
prices of factors. The stage II represents the range of rational production decisions.
Long-run production function - Returns to Scale
In the long run, all factors can be changed. Returns to scale studies the
changes in output when all factors or inputs are changed. An increase in scale
means that all inputs or factors are increased in the same proportion.
Three phases of returns to scale
The changes in output as a result of changes in the scale can be studied in 3
phases. They are
(i) Increasing returns to scale
(ii) Constant returns to scale
(iii) Decreasing returns to scale
Increasing returns to scale
If the increase in all factors leads to a more than proportionate increase
in output, it is called increasing returns to scale. For example, if all the inputs are
increased by 5%, the output increases by more than 5% i.e. by 10%. In this case the
marginal product will be rising.
Constant returns to scale
If we increase all the factors (i.e. scale) in a given proportion, the output will
increase in the same proportion i.e. a 5% increase in all the factors will result in an
equal proportion of 5% increase in the output. Here the marginal product is constant.
Decreasing returns to scale
If the increase in all factors leads to a less than proportionate increase in
output, it is called decreasing returns to scale i.e. if all the factors are increased
by 5%, the output will increase by less than 5% i.e. by 3%. In this phase marginal
product will be decreasing.

Figure 6.2 explains the different phases of returns to scale. When marginal
product increases (AB), total product increases at an increasing rate. So there is
increasing returns to scale. When Marginal Product remains constant (BC), Total
Product increases at a constant rate and this stage is called constant returns to
scale. When Marginal Product decreases (CMP), Total Product increases at a
decreasing rate and it is called decreasing returns to scale.

5. Increasing returns are due
to the indivisibility of factors
and specialisation of labour
Diminishing returns are due to
non-optimal factor proportion and
imperfect elasticity of substitution
of factors.
Increasing returns to scale are due to
economies of scale while diminishing
returns to scale are due to diseconomies

Production function through Iso-quants
The isoquant analysis helps to understand how different combinations of two
or more factors are used to produce a given level of output. Considering two factors
of production, (capital and labour) the following table 6.3 shows various combinations
of capital and labour that help a firm to produce 1000 units of a product.

The two axes measure the quantities of labour and capital and the curve IQ
shows the different combinations that produce 1000 units of output. Each of the
points R1
, R2
, R3
, R4
 and R5
 on the curve shows a capital-labour combination that
can produce 1000 units of output. Therefore the curve is known as an equal product
curve or an iso- quant curve.
Thus an isoquant or isoproduct curve represents different combinations of two
factors of production that yield the same level of output.
100
Characteristics of an isoquant
1. The isoquant is downward sloping from left to right i.e. it is negatively sloped.
2. An isoquant is convex to the origin because of the diminishing marginal
rate of technical substitution. Marginal rate of technical substitution of factor
X (capital) for factor Y (labour) may be defined as the amount of factor Y
(labour) which can be replaced by one unit of factor X (capital), the level of
output remaining unchanged.

Thus the marginal rate of technical substitution is always declining. Hence
the isoquant is always convex to the origin. The slope of the isoquant represents
marginal rate of technical substitution.
1. Higher the isoquant, higher will be the level of output produced. A set of
isoquants which represents different levels of output is called “isoquant
map”. In the isoquant map, the isoquants on the right side represent higher
levels of output and vice versa.

Isocost Line
The isocost line plays an important role in determining the combination of
factors that the firm will choose for production. An isocost line is defined as locus of
points representing various combinations of two factors, which the firm can buy with
a given outlay. Higher isocost lines represent higher outlays (total cost) and lower
isocost lines represent lower outlays.
The isocost line depends on two things :
(1) Prices of the factors of production and
(2) the total outlay, which a firm has to make on the factors of production. Given
these two, the isocost line can be drawn. The slope of the isocost line is
equal to the ratio of the prices of two factors. Thus the slope of the isocost
line is given as
Price of factor X (Capital)
Slope of isocost line =
Price of factor Y (Labour)
Producer’s Equilibrium
A rational producer always tries to achieve largest volume of output from a
given factor-expenditure outlay on factors such that these factors are combined in
an optimal or most efficient way. The producer maximises his profits and produces a
given level of output with least combination of factors. This level of cost combination
of factors will be optimum for him.

Figure 6.6 Producers’Equilibrium
In figure 6.6, E is the point of equilibrium, where isoquant IQ2
 is tangential to
isocost line at AB. Given budget line AB, points ‘P’, ‘N’ and ‘F’ are beyond the reach
of the producer and points ‘R’ and ‘S’ on isoquant IQ1
 give less output than the output
at the point of equilibrium ‘E’ which is on IQ2
 . The amount spent on combinations R,
E, S is the same as all the three points lie on the same isocost line. But the output
produced at point E is higher as E lies on a higher isoquant. Given the isocost line 
102
and the series of isoquants (isoquant-map), a producer will choose that level of
output, where a given isocost line is tangential to the highest possible isoquant.
Thus the producer is in equilibrium at point E where the isoquant is tangential
to the isocost line. At this point, the slopes of the isoquant and the isocost line are
equal. Thus at the equilibrium point the marginal rate of technical substitution is equal
to the price ratio of factors. Hence, the condition for producers’ equilibrium is
MRTSxy = PX/PY
At this point of equilibrium, the combination E (that is OL of labour and OQ of
capital) is called least cost
The Cobb – Douglas Production Function
The simplest and the most widely used production function in economics is
the Cobb-Douglas production function. It is a statistical production function given by
professors C.W. Cobb and P.H. Douglas.
The Cobb-Douglas production function can be stated as follows
Q = bL a C 1-a in which
Q = Actual output
L = Labour
C = Capital
b = number of units of Labour
a = Exponent∗ of labour
1-a = Exponent∗ of Capital
According to the above production function, if both factors of production
(labour and capital) are increased by one percent, the output (total product) will
increase by the sum of the exponents of labour and capital i.e. by (a+1-a). Since
a+1-a =1, according to the equation, when the inputs are increased by one percent,
the output also increases by one percent. Thus the Cobb Douglas production function
explains only constant returns to scale. This is mainly because the addition of
Q = bLa
 Cb
In the above production function, the sum of the exponents shows the degree of
“returns to scale” in production function.
a + b >1 : Increasing returns to scale
a + b =1 : Constant returns to scale
a + b <1 : Decreasing returns to scale
_____________________
* Exponent- a raised figure or symbol that shows how many times a quantity must be
multiplied by itself. For example in a4
 - 4 is the exponent

Large Scale Production – Kinds of Economies
Economies of Scale
‘Economies’ mean advantages. Scale refers to the size of unit. ‘Economies
of Scale’ refers to the cost advantages due to the larger size of production. As
the volume of production increases, the overhead cost will come down. The bulk
purchase of inputs will give a better bargaining power to the producer which will
reduce the average variable cost too. All these advantages are due to the large scale
production and these advantages are called economies of scale.
There are two types of economies of scale
a) Internal economies of scale; b) External economies of scale
a) Internal Economies of Scale
‘Internal economies of scale’ are the advantages enjoyed within the production
unit. These economies are enjoyed by a single firm independently of the action of the
other firms. For instance, one firm may enjoy the advantage of good management;
another may have the advantage of more up-to-date machinery. There are five kinds
of internal economies. They are
1. Technical Economies: As the size of the firm is large, the availability of
capital is more. Due to this, a firm can introduce up- to-date technologies;
thereby the increase in the productivity becomes possible. It is also possible
to conduct research and development which will help to increase the quality
of the product.
2. Financial Economies: It is possible for big firms to float shares in the
market for capital formation. Small firms have to borrow capital whereas
large firms can buy capital.
3. Managerial Economies: Division of labour is the result of large scale
production. Right person can be employed in the right department only if
there is division of labour. This will help a manager to fix responsibility to
each department and thereby the productivity can be increased and the total
production can be maximised.
4. Labour Economies: Large Scale production paves the way for division of
labour. This is also known as specialisation of labour. The specialisation will
increase the quality and ability of the labour. As a result, the productivity of
the firm increases.
5. Marketing Economies: In production, the first buyer is the producer who
buys the raw materials. As the size is large, the quantity bought is larger.
This gives the producer a better bargaining power. Also he can enjoy credit
facilities. All these are possible because of large scale production. Buying is
the first function in marketing.
104
6. Economies of survival: A large firm can have many products. Even if one
product fails in the market, the loss incurred in that product can be managed
by the profit earned from the other products.
b)External economies of scale
When many firms expand in a particular area – i.e., when the industry grows –
they enjoy a number of advantages which are known as external economies of scale.
This is not the advantage enjoyed by a single firm but by all the firms in the industry
due to the structural growth. They are
a) Increased transport facilities
b) Banking facilities
c) Development of townships
d) Information and communication development
All these facilities are available to all firms in an industrial region.
Diseconomies of Scale
The diseconomies are the disadvantages arising to a firm or a group of firms
due to large scale production.
Internal Diseconomies of Scale
If a firm continues to grow and expand beyond the optimum capacity, the
economies of scale disappear and diseconomies will start operating. For instance, if
the size of a firm increases, after a point the difficulty of management arises to that
particular firm which will increase the average cost of production of that firm. This is
known as internal diseconomies of scale.
External Diseconomies of Scale
Beyond a certain stage, too much concentration and localisation of industries
will create diseconomies in production which will be common for all firms in a locality.
For instance, the expansion of an industry in a particular area leads to high rents and
high costs. These are the external diseconomies as this affects all the firms in the
industry located in that particular region.

Chapter 7
Cost and Revenue
Cost
The term ‘cost of production’ means expenses incurred in the production of
a commodity. This refers to the total amount of money spent on the production of a
commodity. The determinants of cost of production are: the size of plant, the level of
production, the nature of technology used, the quantity of inputs used, managerial
and labour efficiency. Thus the cost of production of a commodity is the aggregate of
prices paid for the factors of production used in producing a commodity.
Cost function
The cost function expresses a functional relationship between costs and
output that determine it. Symbolically, the cost function is
C = f (Q)
where
C = Cost
Q = Output
Cost concepts and classifications
Money cost and Real cost
Money cost or nominal cost is the total money expenses incurred by a firm in
producing a commodity.
It includes
(i) Cost of raw materials
(ii) Wages and salaries of labour
(iii) Expenditure on machinery and equipment
(iv) Depreciation on machines, buildings and such other capital goods
(v) Interest on capital
(vi) Other expenses like advertisement, insurance premium and taxes
(vii) Normal profit of the entrepreneur.
Real cost is a subjective concept. It expresses the pains and sacrifices
involved in producing a commodity. The money paid for securing the factors of
productions is money cost whereas the efforts and sacrifice made by the capitalists
to save and invest, by the workers in foregoing leisure and by the landlords constitute
real costs.
108
Opportunity Cost
The opportunity cost of any good is the next best alternative good that is
sacrificed. For example a farmer who is producing wheat can produce potatoes with
the same factors. Therefore the opportunity cost of a quintal of wheat is the amount
of output of potatoes given up.
Accounting Cost and Economic cost
Accounting cost or explicit cost
Accounting costs or explicit costs are the payments made by the entrepreneur
to the suppliers of various productive factors. The accounting costs are only those
costs, which are directly paid out or accounted for by the producer i.e. wages to the
labourers employed, prices for the raw materials purchased, fuel and power used,
rent for the building hired for the production work, the rate of interest on the borrowed
capital and the taxes paid.
Economic cost
The economic cost includes not only the explicit cost but also the implicit
cost. The money rewards for the own services of the entrepreneur and the factors
owned by himself and employed in production are known as implicit costs or imputed
costs. The normal return on money capital invested by the entrepreneur, the wages
or salary for his own services and rent of the land and buildings belonging to him
and used in production constitute implicit cost. Thus Economic cost = Explicit cost +
Implicit cost.
It may be pointed out that the firm will earn economic profits only if it is making
revenue in excess of economic cost.
Economic profit = Total Revenue – Economic Costs.
Private cost and social cost
Private cost is the cost incurred by a firm for production. It includes both
implicit costs and explicit costs.
Social costs are those costs, which are not borne by the producing firm but are
incurred by others in society. For example, when an oil refinery discharges its waste
in the river causing water pollution, such a pollution results in tremendous health
hazards which involve costs to the society as a whole
Fixed cost and variable cost
Fixed cost and variable cost are helpful in understanding the behaviour of
costs over different levels of output.
109
Meaning of Fixed and Variable factors and costs
Fixed and variable factors are with reference to short run production function.
Short run is a period of time over which certain factors of production cannot
be changed, and such factors are called fixed factors. The costs incurred on fixed
factors are called fixed costs. The factors whose quantity can be changed in the short
run are variable factors, and the costs incurred on variable factors are called variable
costs.
Fixed costs are those which are independent of output, that is, they do not
change with changes in output. These costs are a ‘fixed’ amount, which must
be incurred by a firm in the short run whether the output is small or large. E.g.
contractual rent, interest on capital invested, salaries to the permanent staff,
insurance premia and certain taxes.
Variable costs are those costs, which are incurred on the employment of
variable factors of production whose amount can be altered in the short run. Thus the
total variable costs change with the level of output. It rises when output expands and
falls when output contracts. When output is nil, variable cost becomes zero. These
costs include payments such as wages of labour employed, prices of raw materials,
fuel and power used and the transport costs.
Total cost
Total cost is the sum of total fixed cost and total variable cost.
 TC = TFC + TVC where
 TC = Total cost
 TFC = Total Fixed cost
 TVC = Total variable cost
It should be noted that total fixed cost is the same irrespective of the level of
output. Therefore a change in total cost is influenced by the change in variable cost
only.
The relationship between total fixed cost, total variable cost and total cost will
be clear from the Figure 7.1.
110
Short run average cost curves
Average Fixed Cost (AFC)
The average fixed cost is the fixed cost per unit of output. It is obtained by
dividing the total fixed cost by the number of units of the commodity produced.
Symbolically AFC = TFC / Q
Where AFC = Average fixed Cost
 TFC = Total Fixed cost
 Q = number of units of output produced
Suppose for a firm the total fixed cost is Rs 2000 when output is 100 units,
AFC will be Rs 2000/100 = Rs 20 and when output is 200 units, AFC will be Rs
2000/200 = Rs10/- Since total fixed cost is a constant quantity, average fixed cost will
steadily fall as output increases; when output becomes very large, average fixed cost
approaches zero.
Average Variable cost (AVC): Average variable cost is the variable cost per
unit of output. It is the total variable cost divided by the number of units of output
produced.
 AVC = TVC / Q
 Where AVC = Average Variable Cost
 TVC = Total Variable Cost
 Q = number of units of output produced
Average variable cost curve is ‘U’ Shaped. As the output increases, the AVC will fall
upto normal capacity output due to the operation of increasing returns. But beyond
the normal capacity output, the AVC will rise due to the operation of diminishing
returns.
Average Total Cost or Average Cost : Average total cost is simply called
average cost which is the total cost divided by the number of units of output
produced.
AC = TC / Q where
AC = Average Cost
TC = Total Cost
Q = number of units of output produced
Average cost is the sum of average fixed cost and average variable cost.
i.e. AC = AFC+AVC

The average cost is also known as the unit cost since it is the cost per unit of
output produced. The following figure shows the shape of AFC, AVC and ATC in the
short period.
From the figure 7.2, it can be understood that the behaviour of the average
total cost curve depends on the behaviour of AFC and AVC curves. In the beginning,
both AFC and AVC fall. So ATC curve falls. When AVC curve begins rising, AFC curve
falls steeply ie fall in AFC is more than the rise in AVC. So ATC curve continues to
fall. But as output increases further, there is a sharp increase in AVC, which is more
than the fall in AFC. Hence ATC curve rises after a point. The ATC curve like AVC
curve falls first, reaches the minimum value and then rises. Hence it has taken a U
shape.
Marginal Cost
Marginal cost is defined as the addition made to the total cost by the
production of one additional unit of output.

For example, when a firm produces 100 units of output, the marginal cost
would be equal to the total cost of producing 100 units minus the total cost of
producing 99 units. Suppose the total cost of producing 99 units is Rs 9000 and
the total cost of producing 100 units is Rs 10,000 then the marginal cost will be
Rs10, 000 – Rs 9,000 = Rs 1,000. The firm has incurred a sum of Rs 1,000 in the
production of one more unit of the commodity. Symbolically
MCn = TCn
 – TCn-1 where
MCn = Marginal cost
TC n = Total cost of producing n units
TC n-1 = Total cost of producing n-1 units
 The marginal cost curve is given below
The marginal cost curve is ‘U’ shaped. The shape of the cost curve is
determined by the law of variable proportions. If increasing returns (economies of
scale)is in operation, the marginal cost curve will be declining, as the cost will be
decreasing with the increase in output. When the diminishing returns (diseconomies
of scale) are in operation, the MC curve will be increasing as it is the situation of
increasing cost.
113
Relationship between short-run average and short-run marginal cost curves
The relationship between the marginal and the average cost is more a
mathematical one rather than economic.
The relationship can be given as follows:
1) When marginal cost is less than average cost, average cost is falling
2) When marginal cost is greater than the average cost, average cost is rising
3) The marginal cost curve must cut the average cost curve at AC’s minimum
point from below. Thus at the minimum point of AC, MC is equal to AC.
Long run Average Cost Curve (LAC)
In the long-run all factors are variable. Therefore the firm can change the size
of the plant (capital equipment, machinery etc) to meet the changes in demand. A
long-run average cost curve depicts the functional relationship between output and
the long-run cost of production.
Long-run average cost curve
114
The Long run Average Cost (LAC) Curve is based on the assumption
that in the long run a firm has a number of alternatives with regard to the scale of
operations. For each scale of production or plant size, the firm has an appropriate
short-run average cost (SAC) curve. The pattern of these short-run average cost
curves is shown in Figure 7.5. We have assumed that technologically there are
only three sizes of plants – small, medium and large. SAC1
 is relevant for a small
size plant, SAC2
 for a medium size plant and SAC3
 for a large sizeplant. In the short
period, when the output demanded is OA, the firm will choose the smallest size plant.
But for an output beyond OB, the firm will choose medium size plant as the average
cost of small size plant is higher for the same output (JC>KC). For output beyond
OD, the firm will choose large size plant (SAC3
). In the short-run, the firm is tied with
a given plant but in the long-run, the firm moves from one plant to another. As the
scale of production is changed, a new plant is added. The long-run cost of production
is the least possible cost of production of any given level of output, when all inputs
become variable, including the size of the plant.
The long run average cost curve is called ‘planning curve’ of a firm as it helps
in choosing a plant on the decided level of output. The long- run average cost curve
is also called envelope curve as it supports or envelops a group of short-run cost
curves (Figure 7.6). From the figure we can understand that the long run average
cost curve initially falls with increase in output and after a certain point it rises making
a boat shape.
CONCEPTS OF REVENUE
The amount of money, which the firm receives by the sale of its output in the
market, is known as its revenue.
Total Revenue
Total Revenue refers to the total amount of money that a firm receives from
the sale of its products.
Mathematically TR = PQ where TR = Total Revenue; P = Price; Q = Quantity
sold. Suppose a firm sells 1000 units of a product at the price of Rs 10 each, the total
revenue will be 1000 x Rs 10 = Rs 10,000/-
Average Revenue
Average revenue is the revenue per unit of the commodity sold. It is calculated
by dividing the total revenue by the number of units sold.
AR = TR / Q Where
AR = Average Revenue
TR = Total Revenue
Q = Quantity sold
115
Eg: Average Revenue = = 100 /− 1000
10,000 Rs Rs
Thus average revenue means price of the product.
Marginal Revenue
Marginal Revenue is the addition made to the total revenue by selling one
more unit of a commodity.
For example, if 10 units of a product are sold at the price of Rs 15 and 11 units
are sold at Rs14/-, the marginal revenue will be:
MRn = TRn
 – TRn-1
 = Rs (11x 14) – Rs (10x 15)
 = Rs 154 – 150
 = Rs 4/-
Relationship between AR and MR curves
When the average revenue (price) remains constant, the marginal revenue will
also remain constant and will coincide with the average revenue.

A firm can sell large quantities only at lower prices. In that case, the average
revenue (price) of the product falls. When AR falls MR will also fall. But fall in MR will
be more than the fall in the AR. Hence the marginal revenue curve will lie below the
average revenue curve (Fig 7.8)

Measurement of Profit
A firm’s profit may be defined as the difference between its total revenue and
its total cost i.e. Profit = Total Revenue – Total Cost
The aim of any firm is to maximise its profit i.e. to maximise the positive
difference between the Total Revenue (TR) and Total Cost (TC). At that point the
producer will be in equilibrium.
Table 7.5 Maximising Profits
Output (units) Total Revenue(Rs) Total Cost (Rs) Total Profit(Rs)

3 130 90 40

8 285 255 30
9 290 270 20
10 300 310 -10
From Table 7.5 it can be understood the firm will earn maximum profit of Rs 85
when it produces 6 units of output. Thus the firm will be in equilibrium by producing 6
units of output.
Its profit is the maximum at OM level of output where the distance between
the TR curve and the TC curve is the maximum. When the firm produces OL level
of output, and OH level of output, total revenue just equals total cost (TR = TC). At
these points, the firm is making neither profits nor losses. Thus the points S and Q
are called Break- even points.

Market Structure and Pricing
Meaning and Definition of Market
Market generally means a place or a geographical area, where buyers
with money and sellers with their goods meet to exchange goods for money.
In Economics market refers to a group of buyers and sellers who involve in the
transaction of commodities and services.
Characteristics of a market
1. Existence of buyers and sellers of the commodity.
2. The establishment of contact between the buyers and sellers. Distance is of
no consideration if buyers and sellers could contact each other through the
available communication system like telephone, agents, letter correspondence
and Internet.
3. Buyers and sellers deal with the same commodity or variety. Since the market
in economics is identified on the basis of the commodity, similarity of the
product is very essential.
4. There should be a price for the commodity bought and sold in the market.
Classification of Markets
A) Market according to Area
Based on the extent of the market for any product, markets can be classified
into local regional, national and international markets.
Local Market
A local market for a product exists when buyers and sellers of commodity carry
on business in a particular locality or village or area where the demand and supply
conditions are influenced by local conditions only. E.g. Perishable goods like milk and
vegetables and bulky articles like bricks and stones.
National Market
When commodities are demanded and supplied throughout the country, there
is national market e.g. wheat, rice or cotton
Regional Market
Commodities that are demanded and supplied over a region have regional
market.
121
Global Market
When demand and supply conditions are influenced at the global level, we
have international market. e.g. gold, silver, cell phone etc.
On the basis of demand and supply, this geographical classification is made.
With improved transport facilities and communications, even goods of local markets
can become international goods.
B)Market according to time
Marshall classified market based on the time element. In economics “time”
does not mean clock time. It means only the division of time based on extend of
adjustability of supply of a commodity for a given change in its demand. The major
divisions are very short period, short period and long period.
Very Short Period
Very short period refers to the type of competitive market in which the supply
of commodities cannot be changed at all. So in a very short period, the market supply
is perfectly inelastic. The price of the commodity depends on the demand for the
product alone. The perishable commodities like flowers are the best example.
Short-period
Short period refers to that period in which supply can be adjusted to a
limited extent by varying the variable factors alone. The short period supply curve is
relatively elastic. The short period price is determined by the interaction of the shortrun
supply and demand curves.
Long Period
Long period is the time period during which the supply conditions are fully
able to meet the new demand conditions. In the long run, all (both fixed as well
as variable) factors are variable. Thus the supply curve in the long run is perfectly
elastic. Therefore, it is the demand that influences price in the long period.
C)Market according to competition
These markets are classified according to the number of sellers in the
market and the nature of the commodity. The classification of market according to
competition is as follows.
122
Perfect Competition
Perfect competition is a market situation where there are infinite number
of sellers that no one is big enough to have any appreciable influence over market
price.
Features and Conditions of perfect competition
1. Large number of buyers and sellers
There are a large number of buyers and sellers in a perfect competitive market
that neither a single buyer nor a single seller can influence the price. The price is
determined by market forces namely the demand for and the supply of the product.
There will be uniform price in the market. Sellers accept this price and adjust the
quantity produced to maximise their profit. Thus the sellers in the perfect competitive
market are price- takers and quantity adjusters.
2. Homogeneous Product
The products produced by all the firms in the perfectly competitive market
must be homogeneous and identical in all respects i.e. the products in the market
are the same in quantity, size, taste, etc. The products of different firms are perfect
substitutes and the cross- elasticity is infinite.
3. Perfect knowledge about market conditions
Both buyers and sellers are fully aware of the current price in the market.
Therefore the buyer will not offer high price and the sellers will not accept a price less
than the one prevailing in the market.

123
4. Free entry and Free exit
There must be complete freedom for the entry of new firms or the exit of the
existing firms from the industry. When the existing firms are earning super-normal
profits, new firms enter into the market. When there is loss in the industry, some firms
leave the industry. The free entry and free exit are possible only in the long run. That
is because the size of the plant cannot be changed in the short run.
5. Perfect mobility of factors of production
The factors of productions should be free to move from one use to another
or from one industry to another easily to get better remuneration. The assumption of
perfect mobility of factors is essential to fulfil the first condition namely large number
of producers in the market.
6. Absence of transport cost
In a perfectly competitive market, it is assumed that there are no transport
costs. Under perfect competition, a commodity is sold at uniform price throughout the
market. If transport cost is incurred, the firms nearer to the market will charge a low
price than the firms far away. Hence it is assumed that there is no transport cost.
7. Absence of Government or artificial restrictions or collusions
There are no government controls or restrictions on supply, pricing etc. There
is also no collusion among buyers or sellers. The price in the perfectly competitive
market is free to change in response to changes in demand and supply conditions.
Nature of Revenue curves
Under perfect competition, the market price is determined by the market forces
namely the demand for and the supply of the products. Hence there is uniform price
in the market and all the units of the output are sold at the same price. As a result
the average revenue is perfectly elastic. The average revenue curve is horizontally
parallel to X-axis. Since the Average Revenue is constant, Marginal Revenue is also
constant and coincides with Average Revenue. AR curve of a firm represents the
demand curve for the product produced by that firm.
Short run equilibrium price and output determination under perfect competition
1. Since a firm in the perfectly competitive market is a price-taker, it has to
adjust its level of output to maximise its profit. The aim of any producer is to
maximise his profit.
2. The short run is a period in which the number and plant size of the firms
are fixed. In this period, the firm can produce more only by increasing the
variable inputs.
124
3. As the entry of new firms or exit of the existing firms are not possible in the
short-run, the firm in the perfectly competitive market can either earn supernormal
profit or normal profit or incur loss in the short period.
Super-normal Profit
When the average revenue of the firm is greater than its average cost, the firm
is earning super-normal profit.
Short-run equilibrium with super-normal profits

OUTPUT
REVENUE PRICE & COST
PROFITS
In figure 8.1, output is measured along the x-axis and price, revenue and cost
along the y-axis. OP is the prevailing price in the market. PL is the demand curve or
average and the marginal revenue curve. SAC and SMC are the short run average
and marginal cost curves. The firm is in equilibrium at point ‘E’ where MR = MC and
MC curve cuts MR curve from below at the point of equilibrium. Therefore the firm will
be producing OM level of output. At the OM level of output ME is the AR and MF is
the average cost. The profit per unit of output is EF (the difference between ME and
MF). The total profits earned by the firm will be equal to EF (profit per unit) multiplied
by OM or HF (total output). Thus the total profits will be equal to the area HFEP.
HFEP is the supernormal profits earned by the firm.
Long run equilibrium, price and output determination
In the long run, all factors are variable. The firms can increase their output by
increasing the number and plant size of the firms. Moreover, new firms can enter the
industry and the existing firms can leave the industry. As a result, all the existing firms
will earn only normal profit in the long run.
If the existing firms earn supernormal profit, the new firms will enter the
industry to compete with the existing firms. As a result, the output produced will
increase. When the total output increases, the demand for factors of production will
increase leading to increase in prices of the factors. This will result in increase in
average cost.
On the other side, when the output produced increases, the supply of the
product increases. The demand remaining the same, when the supply of the product 
125
increases, the price of the product comes down. Hence the average revenue will
come down. A fall in average revenue and the rise in average cost will continue till
both become equal. (AR = AC). Thus, all the perfectly competitive firms will earn
normal profit in the long run.
Figure 8.2 represents long run equilibrium of firm under perfect competition.
The firm is in equilibrium at point S where LMC = MR = AR = LAC. The long run
equilibrium output is ON. The firm is earning just the normal profit. The equilibrium
price is OP. If the price rises above OP, the firm will earn abnormal profit, which will
attract new firms into the industry. If the price is less than OP, there will be loss and
the tendency will be to exit. So in the long run equilibrium, OP will be the price and
marginal cost will be equal to average cost and average revenue. Thus the firm in
the long run will earn only normal profit. Competitive firms are in equilibrium at the
minimum point of LAC curve. Operating at the minimum point of LAC curve signifies
that the firm is of optimum size i.e. producing output at the lowest possible average
cost.
Advantages of perfect competition
1. There is consumer sovereignty in a perfect competitive market. The consumer
is rational and he has perfect knowledge about the market conditions.
Therefore, he will not purchase the products at a higher price.
2. In the perfectly competitive market, the price is equal to the minimum average
cost. It is beneficial to the consumer.
3. The perfectly competitive firms are price-takers and the products are
homogeneous. Therefore it is not necessary for the producers to incur
expenditure on advertisement to promote sales. This reduces the wastage of
resources.
4. In the long run, the perfectly competitive firm is functioning at the optimum level.
This means that maximum economic efficiency in production is achieved. As
the actual output produced by the firm is equal to the optimum output, there is
no idle or unused or excess capacity. 
126
Monopoly
Monopoly is a market structure in which there is a single seller, there are no
close substitutes for the commodity it produces and there are barriers to entry.
Characteristics of Monopoly
1. Single Seller: There is only one seller; he can control either price or supply of
his product. But he cannot control demand for the product, as there are many
buyers.
2. No close Substitutes: There are no close substitutes for the product. The
buyers have no alternatives or choice. Either they have to buy the product or go
without it.
3. Price: The monopolist has control over the supply so as to increase the price.
Sometimes he may adopt price discrimination. He may fix different prices for
different sets of consumers. A monopolist can either fix the price or quantity of
output; but he cannot do both, at the same time.
4. No Entry: There is no freedom to other producers to enter the market as the
monopolist is enjoying monopoly power. There are strong barriers for new firms
to enter. There are legal, technological, economic and natural obstacles, which
may block the entry of new producers.
5. Firm and Industry: Under monopoly, there is no difference between a firm
and an industry. As there is only one firm, that single firm constitutes the whole
industry. .
Causes for Monopoly
1. Natural: A monopoly may arise on account of some natural causes. Some
minerals are available only in certain regions. For example, South Africa has
the monopoly of diamonds; nickel in the world is mostly available in Canada
and oil in Middle East. This is natural monopoly.
2. Technical: Monopoly power may be enjoyed due to technical reasons. A firm
may have control over raw materials, technical knowledge, special know-how,
scientific secrets and formula that enable a monopolist to produce a commodity.
e.g., Coco Cola.
3. Legal: Monopoly power is achieved through patent rights, copyright and trade
marks by the producers. This is called legal monopoly.
4. Large Amount of Capital: The manufacture of some goods requires a large
amount of capital or lumpiness of capital. All firms cannot enter the field
because they cannot afford to invest such a large amount of capital. This may
give rise to monopoly. For example, iron and steel industry, railways, etc.
127
5. State: Government will have the sole right of producing and selling some
goods. They are State monopolies. For example, we have public utilities like
electricity and railways. These public utilities are undertaken by the State.
Price and Output Determination
A monopolist like a perfectly competitive firm tries to maximise his profits.
A monopoly firm faces a downward sloping demand curve, that is, its average
revenue curve. The downward sloping demand curve implies that larger output can
be sold only by reducing the price. Its marginal revenue curve will be below the
average revenue curve.
The average cost curve is ‘U’ shaped. The monopolist will be in equilibrium
when MC = MR and the MC curve cuts the MR curve from below.
In figure 8.4, AR is the Average Revenue Curve and MR is the Marginal
revenue curve. AR curve is falling and MR curve lies below AR. The monopolist is
in equilibrium at E where MR = MC. He produces OM units of output and fixes price
at OP. At OM output, the average revenue is MS and average cost MT. Therefore
the profit per unit is MS-MT = TS. Total profit is average profit (TS) multiplied by
output (OM), which is equal to HTSP. The monopolist is in equilibrium at point E and
produces OM output at which he is earning maximum profit. The monopoly price is
higher than the marginal revenue and marginal cost. COST & REVENUE

OUTPUT
Advantages
1. Monopoly firms have large-scale production possibilities and also can enjoy
both internal and external economies. This will result in the reduction of
costs of production. Output can be sold at low prices. This is beneficial to the
consumers.
2. Monopoly firms have vast financial resources which could be used for research
and development. This will enable the firms to innovate quickly.
128
3. There are a number of weak firms in an industry. These firms can combine
together in the form of monopoly to meet competition. In such a case, market
can be expanded.
Although there are some advantages, there is a danger that monopoly power
might be misused for exploiting the consumers.
Disadvantages
1. A monopolist always charges a high price, which is higher than the competitive
price. Thus a monopolist exploits the consumers.
2. A monopolist is interested in getting maximum profit. He may restrict the output
and raise prices. Thus, he creates artificial scarcity for his product.
3. A monopolist often charges different prices for the same product from different
consumers. He extracts maximum price according to the ability to pay of
different consumers.
4. A monopolist uses large-scale production and huge resources to promote
his own selfish interest. He may adopt wrong practices to establish absolute
monopoly power.
5. In a country dominated by monopolies, wealth is concentrated in the hands of
a few. It will lead to inequality of incomes. This is against the principle of the
socialistic pattern of society.
Methods of Controlling Monopoly
1. Legislative Method: Government can control monopolies by legal actions.
Anti-monopoly legislation has been enacted to check the growth of monopoly.
In India, the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act was passed in
1969. The objective of this Act is to prevent the unwanted growth of private
monopolies and concentration of economic power in the hands of a small
number of individuals and families.
2. Controlling Price and Output: This method can be applied in the case of
natural monopolies. Government would fix either price or output or both.
3. Taxation: Taxation is another method by which the monopolistic power can
be prevented or restricted. Government can impose a lump-sum tax on a
monopoly firm, irrespective of its level of output. Consequently, its total profit
will fall.
4. Nationalisation: Nationalising big companies is one of the solutions.
Government may take over such monopolistic companies, which are exploiting
the consumers.
129
5. Consumer’s Association: The growth of monopoly power can also be
controlled by encouraging the formation of consumers associations to improve
the bargaining power of consumers.
Comparison between Perfect Competition and Monopoly
The main aim of firms both under monopoly and perfect competition is to
maximise profit. In both the market forms, the firms are in equilibrium at the output
level where MC = MR. The differences are as follows:
Perfect Competition Monopoly
1. Average revenue curve is a
horizontal straight line parallel to X
axis .Marginal revenue is equal to
average revenue and price
Both average revenue curve and
marginal revenue curve are downward
falling curves. Marginal revenue is less
than average revenue and price.
2. At the equilibrium, MC = MR = AR.
That is price charged is equal to
marginal cost of production
At the equilibrium, MC = MR < AR that
is price charged is above marginal cost
3. The firm in the long run comes to
equilibrium at the minimum point
or the lowest point of the long run
average cost curve. The firm tends
to be of optimum size operating at
the minimum average cost.
Even in the long run equilibrium the
firm will be operating at a higher level
of average cost. The firm stops short of
optimum size.
4. Equilibrium can be conceived only
under increasing cost and not
under decreasing or constant cost
conditions
Equilibrium situation is possible at
increasing, decreasing or constant cost
conditions.
5. The firm can earn only normal profit
in the long run and may earn super
profit in the short run
But monopoly firm earns super normal
profit both in short run and long run
6. Price will be lower and the output is
larger
Price is higher and the output will be
smaller
Price Discrimination
Price discrimination means the practice of selling the same commodity at
different prices to different buyers. If the monopolist charges different prices from
different consumers for the same commodity, it is called price discrimination or
discriminating monopoly.
130
Definition
Price discrimination may be defined as “the sale of technically similar products
at prices which are not proportional to marginal cost”. For example, all cinema
theatres charge different prices for different classes of people.
Conditions of Price Discrimination
Price discrimination is possible only if the following conditions are fulfilled.
1. The demand must not be transferable from the high priced market to the low
priced market. If rich people do not buy the high-priced deluxe edition of the
book, but wait for the low-priced popular edition to come out, then personal
discrimination will fail.
2. The monopolist should keep the two markets or different markets separate so
that the commodity will not be moving from one market to the other market. If it
is possible to buy the product in the cheaper market of the monopolist and sell
it in the dearer market, there can never be two prices for the commodity. If the
industrial buyer of cheap electricity uses it for domestic consumption, then trade
discrimination will fail.
The above two conditions are essential to adopt price discrimination.
Monopolistic Competition
Monopolistic competition, as the name itself implies, is a blending of monopoly
and competition. Monopolistic competition refers to the market situation in which a
large number of sellers produce goods which are close substitutes of one another.
The products are similar but not identical. The particular brand of product will have
a group of loyal consumers. In this respect, each firm will have some monopoly and
at the same time the firm has to compete in the market with the other firms as they
produce a fair substitute. The essential features of monopolistic competition are
product differentiation and existence of many sellers.
The following are the examples of monopolistic competition in Indian context.
1. Shampoo - Sun Silk, Clinic Plus, Ponds, Chik, Velvette, Kadal, Head
 and Shoulder, Pantene, Vatika, Garnier, Meera
2. Tooth Paste - Binaca, Colgate, Forhans, Close-up, Promise, Pepsodent,
 Vicco Vajradanti, Ajanta, Anchor, Babool.
Characteristics of Monopolistic Competition
(i) Existence of Large Number of firms: Under monopolistic competition, the
number of firms producing a commodity will be very large. The term ‘very large’
denotes that contribution of each firm towards the total demand of the product is
small. Each firm will act independently on the basis of product differentiation and 
131
each firm determines its price-output policies. Any action of the individual firm in
increasing or decreasing the output will have little or no effect on other firms.
(ii) Product differentiation: Product differentiation is the essence of monopolistic
competition. Product differentiation is the process of altering goods that serve the
same purpose so that they differ in minor ways.
Product differentiation can be brought about in various ways. Product
differentiation is attempted through (a) physical difference; (b) quality difference;
(c) imaginary difference and (d) purchase benefit difference. It may be by using
different quality of the raw material and different chemicals and mixtures used in the
product. Difference in workmanship, durability and strength will also make product
differentiation. Product differentiation may also be effected by offering customers
some benefits with the sale of the product. Facilities like free servicing, home
delivery, acceptance of returned goods, etc. would make the customers demand that
particular brand of product when such facilities are available. Product differentiation
through effective advertisement is another method. This is known as sales promotion.
By frequently advertising the brand of the product through press, film, radio, and TV,
the consumers are made to feel that the brand produced by the firm in question is
superior to that of other brands sold by other firms.
(iii) Selling Costs: From the discussion of ‘product differentiation’, we can infer that
the producer under monopolistic competition has to incur expenses to popularise
his brand. This expenditure involved in selling the product is called selling cost.
According to Prof. Chamberlin, selling cost is “the cost incurred in order to alter
the position or shape of the demand curve for a product”. Most important form of
selling cost is advertisement. Sales promotion by advertisement is called non-price
competition.
(iv) Freedom of entry and exit of firms: Another important feature is the freedom of
any firm to enter into the field and produce the commodity under its own brand name
and any firm can go out of the field if so chosen. There are no barriers as in the case
of monopoly
Monopolistic competition presupposes that customers have definite
preferences for particular varieties or brand of products. Hence pricing is not the
problem but product differentiation is the problem and competition is not on prices but
on products.
Thus in monopolistic competition, the features of monopoly and perfect
competition are partially present.
Determination of Equilibrium price and output under monopolistic competition
The monopolistic competitive firm will come to equilibrium on the principle of
equalising MR with MC. Each firm will choose that price and output where it will be 
132
maximising its profit. Figure 8.5 shows the equilibrium of the individual firm in the
short period.
MC and AC are the short period marginal cost and average cost curves. The
sloping down average revenue and marginal revenue curves are shown as AR and
MR. The equilibrium point is E where MR = MC. The equilibrium output is OM and the
price of the product is fixed at OP. The difference between average cost and average
revenue is SQ. The output is OM. So, the supernormal profit for the firm is shown by
the rectangle PQSR. The firm by producing OM units of its commodity and selling it
at a price of OP per unit realizes the maximum profit in the short run.
The different firms in monopolistic competition may be making either abnormal
profits or losses in the short period depending on their costs and revenue curves.
In the long run, if the existing firms earn super normal profit, the entry of
new firms will reduce its share in the market. The average revenue of the product
will come down. The demand for factors of production will increase the cost of
production. Hence, the size of the profit will be reduced. If the existing firms incur
losses in the long-run, some of the firms will leave the industry increasing the share
of the existing firms in the market. As the demand for factors becomes less, the price
of factors will come down. This will reduce the cost of production, which will increase
the profit earned by the existing firm. Thus under monopolistic competition, all the
existing firms will earn normal profit in the long run.
Wastages of Monopolistic competition
1. Unemployment: Under monopolistic competition, the firms produce less
than optimum output. As a result, the productive capacity is not used to the
fullest extent. This will lead to unemployment of resources.
2. Excess capacity: Excess capacity is the difference between the optimum
output that can be produced and the actual output produced by the firm.
In the long run, a monopolistic firm produces an output which is less than
the optimum output that is the output corresponding to the minimum 
133
average cost. This leads to excess capacity which is regarded as waste in
monopolistic competition.
3. Advertisement: There is a lot of waste in competitive advertisements under
monopolistic competition. The wasteful and competitive advertisements lead
to high cost to consumers.
4. Too Many Varieties of Goods: Introducing too many varieties of a good is
another waste of monopolistic competition. The goods differ in size, shape,
style and colour. A reasonable number of varieties would be desirable. Cost
per unit can be reduced if only a few are produced.
5. Inefficient Firms: Under monopolistic competition, inefficient firms charge
prices higher than their marginal cost. Such type of inefficient firms should
be kept out of the industry. But, the buyers’ preference for such products
enables the inefficient firms to continue to exist. Efficient firms cannot drive
out the inefficient firms because the former may not be able to attract the
customers of the latter.
Oligopoly
Oligopoly refers to a form of imperfect competition where there will be only a
few sellers producing either homogenous or differentiated products.
Characteristics of Oligopoly
1. Interdependence: The most important feature of oligopoly is
interdependence in decision - making. Since there are a few firms, each firm
closely watches the activities of the other firm. Any change in price, output,
product, etc., by a firm will have a direct effect on the fortune of its rivals.
So an oligopolistic firm must consider not only the market demand for its
product, but also the possible moves of other firms in the industry.
2. Group Behaviour: Firms may realise the importance of mutual cooperation.
Then they will have a tendency of collusion. At the same time, the
desire of each firm to earn maximum profit may encourage competitive spirit.
Thus, co-operative and collusive trend as well as competitive trend would
prevail in an oligopolistic market.
Price Rigidity: Another important feature of oligopoly is price rigidity. Price is sticky
or rigid at the prevailing level due to the fear of reaction from the rival firms. If an
oligopolistic firm lowers its price, the price reduction will be followed by the rival
firms. As a result, the firm loses its profit. Expecting the same kind of reaction, if the
oligopolistic firm raises the price, the rival firms will not follow. This would result in
losing customers. In both ways the firm would face difficulties. Hence the price is
rigid.

Chapter 9
Marginal Productivity Theory of Distribution
The marginal productivity theory of distribution is the general theory of
distribution. The theory explains how prices of various factors of production are
determined under conditions of perfect competition. It emphasizes that any variable
factor must obtain a reward equal to its marginal product.
There is no fundamental difference between the mechanism of determination
of factor prices and that of prices of commodities. Factor prices are determined in
markets under the forces of supply and demand. But there is one difference. While
the demand for commodities is direct demand, the demand for factors of production
is derived demand. For example, there will be demand for workers engaged in
construction industry (e.g. masons) only when there is demand for housing.
According to the marginal productivity theory of distribution, in a perfectly
competitive market (for products and inputs), each factor will be paid a price equal
to the value of its physical product. Though the theory is applicable to all factors of
production, we may illustrate it with reference to labour.
A firm will go on employing more and more units of a factor until the price of
that factor is equal to the value of the marginal product. In other words, each factor
will be rewarded according to its marginal productivity. The marginal productivity is
equal to the value of the additional product which an employer gets when he employs
an additional unit of that factor. We assume that the supply of all other factors remain
constant.
We shall give a simple illustration of the marginal productivity theory of
distribution by making use of labour.
The aim of a firm is maximization of profit. It will hire a factor as long as it adds
more to total revenue than to total cost. Thus a firm will hire a factor upto the point at
which the marginal unit contributes as much to total cost as to total revenue because
total profit cannot be further increased.
The condition of equilibrium in the labour market is
 MCL
 = VMPL
 Where MCL
 = Marginal cost of labour
 VMPL = Value of marginal product of labour.
 Or W = VMPL
 Where W = wages of labour
138
Note : It is assumed that a firm can employ any amount of labour under a given wage rate as
the supply of labour is assumed to be unlimited in a competitive market.

Note : P (The price is assumed to be constant under conditions of perfect

In fig. 9.2, the equilibrium of the firm is shown by E. This is so because to the
left of L*, each unit of labour costs less than the value of its product (VMPL > W).
Hence the firm will make more profit by hiring more workers. To the right of VMPL<W.
Hence, the profits of the firm will be reduced. So profits will be maximum when VMPL
= W.
It follows from the above discussion that the demand curve of a firm for a
single variable factor (e.g. labour) is its value of marginal product curve.
Thus the productivity of the marginal unit of a factor determines the rate that is
to be paid to all units of the factor. The employer adopts the principle of substitution
and combines land, labour and capital in such a way that the cost of production is
minimum. Then the reward for each factor is determined by its marginal productivity.
The marginal productivity theory of distribution has been used to explain the
determination of rent, wages, interest and profits. That is why, it is called general
theory of distribution.
139
Assumptions of the theory
The marginal productivity theory is based on the following assumptions.
1. There is perfect competition.
2. All units of a factor are homogeneous. It means that one unit of a factor is the
same as the other.
3. Factors can be substituted for each other. That is, all factors are
interchangeable.
4. The theory is based on the law of diminishing returns as applied to business.
The law of diminishing returns tells that if you go on employing more and more
units of a factor, its marginal returns will diminish. So a firm, when it comes to
know that the increase in a certain factor is resulting in diminishing returns, the
firm will substitute it with some other factor. Thereby, it will try to reduce the cost
of production.
Criticism of the theory
The following are some of the points of criticism against the marginal
productivity theory of distribution.
1. Every product is a joint product and its value cannot be separately attributed to
either labour or capital. Again, it is rather difficult to measure the “productivity”
of certain categories of labour like doctors, lawyers and teachers who render
services.
2. The theory takes into account only the factors operating on the side of demand
by ignoring the supply side. For example, when there is scarcity of a factor, it is
paid much more than the normal price.
3. The theory is based on the assumption of perfect competition and full
employment. But in the real world, we have only imperfect competition; we do
not have perfect competition.
4. In practice, it is rather difficult to vary the use of the factors of production.
5. The theory does not carry with it any ethical justification. If we accept the
theory, it means that factors get the value of what they produce. For example,
workers in a firm may get low wages not because their productivity is low but
because there might be exploitation of labour. Hence we should not make use
of this theory to justify the existing system of unequal distribution.
We may note that in spite of the above points of criticism against the theory, it
explains the role of productivity in the determination of factor prices. In the words of
Marshall, “the doctrine throws into clear light one of the causes that govern wages”.
140
Rent
In ordinary language, “rent” refers to any periodic payment made for the
use of a good. For example, when we live in someone’s house, we pay rent. This
rent is contract payment. The contract rent includes besides the payment made for
the use of land, interest on the capital invested in the house, wages and profit. But
classical economists like Ricardo referred by “rent” to the payment made for the use
of agricultural land. Rent arises because of the peculiar characteristics of land. The
supply of land is inelastic and it differs in fertility. Rent arises because of differences
in fertility. Those lands which are more fertile than others get rent.
The Ricardian theory of Rent
Ricardian theory of rent is one of the earliest theories of rent. It is named after
Ricardo, a great classical economist of the 19th century.
According to Ricardo, “rent is that portion of the produce of the earth which is
paid to the landlord for the use of the original and indestructible powers of the soil”.
So rent is payment made for the use of land for its original powers. Ricardo believed
that rent arose on account of differences in the fertility of land. Only superior lands
get rent. Rent is a differential surplus.
Rent may also arise on account of situational advantage. For example, some
lands may be nearer to the market. The producer can save a lot of transport costs.
Even if all lands are equally fertile, lands which enjoy situational advantage will earn
rent.
Ricardo explained his theory by taking the example of colonization. If some
people go and settle down in a place, first they will cultivate the best lands. If more
people go and settle down, the demand for land will increase and they will cultivate
the second-grade lands. The cost of production will go up. So the price of grain in
the market must cover the cost of cultivation. In this case, the first grade land will get
rent. After some time, if there is increase in population, even third grade lands will
be cultivated. Now, even second grade lands will get rent and first grade lands will
get more rent but the third grade land will not get rent. It is known as no - rent land.
According to Ricardo, rent is price determined, that is, it is determined by price of the
grains produced in the land. He also believed that rent is high because price is high
and not the other way round. Ricardo came to the conclusion that rent did not enter
price because there are some no - rent or marginal lands. As the produce of no-rent
land gets a price, Ricardo argued that rent did not enter price.
In figure 9.3, grades of land are shown along the X axis and the output up the
y – axis. The shaded area in the diagram indicates rent. In this case, grade I and
grade II lands get rent. The grade III land will not get rent.
141
Diagrammatic Illustration of Ricardian theory of Rent.
Criticism of the Ricardian Theory of Rent
Ricardo tells that only the best lands are cultivated first. There is no historical proof
for this.
1. According to Ricardo, land has “original and indestructible powers”. But
the fertility of land may decline after some time because of continuous
cultivation.
2. Ricardo believed that rent is peculiar to land alone. But many modern
economists argue that the rent aspect can be seen in other factors like
labour and capital. Rent arises whenever the supply of a factor is inelastic in
relation to the demand for it.
3. Ricardo is of the view that rent does not enter the price of the commodity
produced in it. But rent enters the price from the point of view of a single
firm.
4. Ricardian theory does not take note of scarcity rent.
5. It is based on perfect competition. Only under perfect competition, there will
be one price for a good. But in the real world, we have imperfect competition.
Though there are some criticisms against the Ricardian theory, we may note it
tells that because of increasing pressure on land, we have to cultivate inferior lands.
Modern Theory of Rent
In the modern theory of rent, the term rent refers to “payments made for
factors of production which are in imperfectly elastic supply”. By this definition, rent
is applied to other factors like labour and capital. In other words, rent does not apply
to land alone. Just as land differs in fertility, men differ in their ability. For example, a
surgeon with a rare skill may earn a lot of income. There is an element of rent in it. In
fact, we have a theory of profits known as “Rent theory of profits”.
142
Marshall has introduced the concept of “Quasi-rent” with regard to machines
and other man-made appliances. So the modern view is that rent can be applied to
all factors of production. Whenever, the supply of a factor is inelastic in relation to the
demand for it, rent arises.
To explain rent, modern economists also make use of the term transfer
earnings. Transfer earnings refer to the amount that a factor could earn in its best
paid alternative employment. It represents the opportunity cost of its present
employment. Any payment in excess of this amount is a surplus above what is
necessary to retain the factor in its best-paid employment and so is rent. Thus, any
payment in excess of transfer earnings is economic rent. If a popular south Indian
Cinema actor who is normally paid, say Rs.two crores, gets an offer to act in a Hindi
film for Rs. three crores, his transfer earnings are Rs. two crores. Rs. one crore may
be considered as economic rent for acting in the Hindi film. So the main point about
the modern theory of rent is that rent is not peculiar to land alone. The rent aspect
can be seen in other factor incomes as well.
Quasi-Rent
According to Marshall, ‘Quasi-rent is the income derived from machines and
other appliances for production by man”.
There are some machines and other man-made appliances (e.g. boats)
whose supply may be inelastic in the short run in relation to the demand for them.
For example, when there is large increase in demand for fish during a season, the
demand for boats will increase. But you cannot increase their supply over night. So
they will earn some extra income over and above the normal income they receive.
This, Marshall calls Quasi-rent. Quasi-rent will disappear, when once the supply of
boats increases.
Wages
Introduction
Wages are the reward for labour. There are two main kinds of wages. (1)
money wages and (2) real wages. Money wages are also known as nominal
wages. Real wages refer to the commodities and services which the money wages
command. They depend mainly on the purchasing power of money, which in turn
depends upon the price level. The standard of living of workers in a country depends
upon the real wages. Further, a farm worker may get low money wages. But if he
gets free board and lodging, we must take that also into account while considering
real wages.
Theories of wages
There are many theories of wages. Some of the early theories of wages are
: 1. The Subsistence Theory of wages ; 2. The Standard of Living Theory ; 3. The
Wages Fund Theory ; 4. The Residual Claimant Theory
143
Some of the important recent theories of wages are
1. The Marginal productivity theory of wages ;
2. The Market theory of wages and
3. The Bargaining theory of wages.
Early theories of wages
1. The subsistence theory of wages : According to this theory, the wages
that are paid to a worker must be just enough to cover his bare needs of
subsistence. If the workers are paid less than the subsistence wage, there
will be starvation and death and it will result in shortage of supply of labour.
Criticism : The main criticism against the theory is that it is based on the
assumption that an increase in wages will result in an increase in population. Man is
different from an animal. Besides bare needs, he needs some comforts. This theory
does not take note of that. And it is one sided. It ignores the forces operating on the
side of demand. This theory is based on bad ethics.
2. The standard of living theory : This theory tells that wages depend upon the
standard of living of workers.
Criticism : There is no doubt that the standard of living theory is an
improvement on the subsistence theory. It is true that there is relationship between
standard of living and wages. But it is rather difficult to say which is the cause and
which is the result.
3. The Wages Fund Theory : According to Wages Fund Theory, “wages depend
upon the proportion between population and capital”. The term “capital” in
the context refers to the fund set apart for payment of wages. And the word
‘population’ refers to workers. If the supply of workers increases, wages will
fall and vice versa.
Criticism : The theory assumes that an increase in wages will result in an
increase in population. But there is no direct relationship between the two. Further,
it tells that if wages rise, profits will fall. This is not correct because during periods of
good trade, both wages and profits will rise.
4. The Residual Claimant Theory : According to this theory, wages “equal the
whole product minus rent, interest and profits” (Walker). In other words,
the theory tells that wages are paid out of the residue that is left over after
making payment for rent, interest and profits.
Criticism : The main criticism against the theory is that it considers wages as
residual payment. But wages are in the nature of advance payment and they have to
be paid first. Normally, profits are taken at the end.
144
Recent Theories of wages
1. The Marginal productivity theory of wages : The marginal productivity
theory of wages is only an application of the marginal productivity theory
of distribution, which is a general theory of distribution. The theory explains
how wages are determined under conditions of perfect competition.
According to the marginal productivity theory, wages will be equal to the
value of the marginal product of labour.
As an employer goes on employing more and more units of labour, its
marginal product will fall because of the law of diminishing marginal returns. So he
will employ labour upto the point where the wages he pays are equal to the value
of the marginal product of labour. All units are assumed to be uniform. So the
productivity of the marginal unit of labour determines the rate at which wages are to
be paid to all units of labour.
Criticism :1. Every product is produced by the joint effort of all factors of
production. It is rather difficult to measure the productivity of each factor in terms of
the product produced. The difficulty is more in measuring the marginal productivity
of those who render services (eg. doctors, actors and lawyers) ; 2. it is based on
the assumption of perfect competition. But in the real world, we have only imperfect
competition ; 3) under monopoly, wages will be lower than the marginal product of
labour because there is exploitation of labour ; 4) wages are in the nature of advance
payment. So an employer will deduct some amount to cover the interest on capital
and pay the workers wages which are lower than their marginal product. So wages
are the discounted marginal product of labour 5). The theory should not be used to
justify the low wages in an economy and the inequalitites of incomes. Wages might
be low because of exploitation of labour. In spite of the above criticism, “the doctrine
throws into clear light the action of one of the causes that govern wages”. (Marshall).
The Market Theory of Wages
The market theory looks at wages as the price of labour. Like all other prices,
wages are determined by the market forces of supply and demand.
The supply of labour generally refers to the total number of people available
for employment. Some types of labour require long periods of training. During that
long period, workers have to sacrifice their earnings. We have to take note of the
foregone earnings while estimating the cost of labour which determines its supply.
The demand for labour
Demand for labour is a derived demand. Modern production is carried on
largely on the basis of anticipation of demand for goods. During good trade, demand
for labour will be more. Again, if capital is cheap, the employer will try to substitute
capital for labour. When there is increase in investment, there will be increase in
demand for labour.
145
In a competitive labour market, equilibrium will be established at the wage that
equates the demand for labour with the supply of labour.

and wages are represented up the Y axis. Wages are determined (OW) at that point
(E) where the demand for labour is equal to the supply of labour (ON)
If demand for labour is high relative to its supply, wages will be high and vice
versa. On the supply side, there are many imperfections. There is geographical
immobility of labour. There may be shortage in the supply of certain categories of
labour (eg. doctors, engineers). In some industries, the supply of labour is controlled
by trade unions.
The Bargaining Theory of Wages
The bargaining theory of wages takes note of the influence of trade unions on
wages through collective bargaining. According to the theory, the level of wages in
an industry depends on the bargaining strength of the trade union concerned. The
strength of a trade union depends upon many things like the size of its membership,
the size of its “fighting fund”, and its ability to cause dislocation in the industry and
the economy through strike. During periods of full employment and good trade, trade
unions will be in a strong position and during depression marked by bad trade and
mass unemployment, trade unions will be in a weak position.
A trade union may increase wages by restricting the supply of labour. For
example, it may insist that only members of a trade union should be employed. This
is known as closed shop policy. It may threaten that it will go on strike if a minimum
wage is not paid.
146
Interest
Interest is the price paid for the use of capital. This is ‘net interest’ or ‘pure
interest’. A good example of pure interest is the interest we get on some government
securities. It may be regarded as net interest. Gross interest, includes besides net
interest, other things such as reward for risk, remuneration for incovenience and
payment for services. Thus gross interest covers trade risks and personal risks. For
example, when a money lender lends money to an Indian farmer, he charges high
rate of interest because there is the risk of non - payment of the amount borrowed.
There are trade risks and personal risks. Generally, people prefer to have cash
balances. This is known as liquidity preference. When you lend money to someone,
you cannot get it for sometime. And that is incovenience. So to compensate it, one
must be paid some extra income. So, gross interest includes compensation for all the
above things besides net interest.
Theories of Interest
Some of the theories of interest are (1) The Abstinence or Waiting Theory
of Interest ; 2. The Agio Theory and Time Preference Theory ; 3. The Marginal
Productivity Theory ; 4. Saving and Investment Theory (The classical theory) 5.
Loanable Funds Theory and 6. The Liquidity Preference Theory
According to the Abstinence theory of Nassau Senior, interest is the reward
for abstaining from the immediate consumption of wealth,. When people save, they
abstain from present consumption. That involves some sacrifice. To make them
save, interest is offered as a reward. But Marshall preferred the word, “waiting” to
“absitinence”.
The “Agio”theory of interest of Bohm-Bawerk tells that as the present carries a
premium (agio) over the future, and as people prefer present consumption to future
consumption, we have to pay a price for them by way of compensation. And that is
interest. The time preference theory of Irving Fisher is more or less the same as Agio
theory of interest. The marginal productivity theory of distribution is nothing but the
application of the marginal productivity theory of distribution. It tells that interest tends
to equal the marginal productivity of capital.
The classical theory of interest tells that the rate of interest is determined by
the supply of capital which depends upon savings and the demand for capital for
investment. The theory is based on the assumption that there is a direct relationship
between the rate of interest, savings and direct relationship between interest and
investment. The classical economists believed that savings would increase when the
interest rates were high, and investment would increase with a fall in interest rate.
And the equilibrium between saving and investment was brought about by the rate of
interest.
147
Loanable funds theory (Neo – classical theory) of Interest
The loanable funds theory was developed by Knut Wicksell, Dennis Robertson
and others. The loanable funds theory is wider in its scope than the classical theory
of interest. The term “loanable funds” includes not only saving out of current income
but also bank credit, dishoarding and disinvestments. But by saving, the classical
economists referred only to saving out of current income. We know now that bank
credit is an important source of funds for investment.
In the classical theory, saving was demanded only for investment. But
according to loanable funds theory, the demand for funds arose, not only for
investment but also for hoarding wealth.
The classical theory regarded interest as a function of saving and investment,
(r = f (S.I.) But, according to loanable funds theory, the rate of interest is a function
of four variables, i.e r = f (I S M.L.) where r is the rate of interest, I = investment, S =
saving, M = bank credit and L = desire to hoard or the desire for liquidity.
In Fig. 9.5 The Curve ‘S’ represents savings, the curve ‘M’ represents bank
credit (including dishoarded and disinvested wealth). The curve S + M represents
total loanable funds at different rates of interest.
On the demand side, the curve I represents demand for investment. The
curve L represents demand for idle cash balances or to hoard money. The curve I
+ L represents the total demand for loanable funds at different rates of interest. The
market rate of interest rm is determined by the intersection of S + M curve and I + L
curve. The aggregate demand for loanable funds is equal to the aggregate supply of
loanable funds at this rate of interest. In the classical theory, rn which may be called
the natural rate of interest is determined by the intersection of I and S curves. That
is, when the rate of interest is rn, the demand for investment is equal to the supply of
savings.
148
Criticism : There is no doubt that loanable funds theory is an improvement
over the classical theory of interest. It has been criticized on the ground that it
assumes that saving is a function of the rate of interest ; 2. it ignores the influence of
the changes in the level of investment on employment, income and on savings.
Liquidity preference theory (Keynesian theory) of interest.
Generally people prefer to hold a part of their assets in the form of cash. Cash
is a liquid asset. According to Keynes, interest is the reward for parting with liquidity
for a specified period of time. In other words, it is the reward for not hoarding.
According to Keynes, people have liquidity preference for three motives. They
are 1. Transaction motive; 2. Precautionary motive; and 3. Speculative motive.
The transaction motive refers to the money held to finance day to day
spending. Precautionary money is held to meet an unforeseen expenditure.
Keynes defines speculative motive as “the object of securing profit from
knowing better than the market what the future will bring forth.” Of the three motives,
speculative motive is more important in determining the rate of interest. Keynes
believed that the amount of money held for speculative motive would vary inversely
with the rate of interest.
Keynes was of the view that the rate of interest was determined by liquidity
preference on the one hand and the supply of money on the other.

determined by the intersection of L and M curves. There will be increase in the rate of

 ,when there is increase in demand for money to L1
 or by a decrease in
the supply of money to M1
 .
Criticism : Keynesian theory is a general theory of interest and it is far superior
to the earlier theories of interest. But critics say that Keynes has over - emphasized
liquidity preference factor in the theory of interest. Moreover, only when a person 
149
has savings, the question of parting with liquidity arises. In the words of Jacob Viner,
“without saving, there can be no liquidity to surrender. The rate of interest is the
return for “saving without liquidity”.
Profits
Profits are the reward for organization or entrepreneurship. Risk- taking and
uncertainty-bearing are the main functions of an entrepreneur. So we may consider
profit as the reward for the above functions.
Gross Profit : Generally when we speak of profit, we refer to the difference
between the total expenses of producing a good and the total revenue from it. But
this is gross profit.
Gross Profit and Net Profit : Gross profit includes besides net profit other
things such as the interest on capital, rent of land, wages of manangement and some
extra income on account of the monopoly position of a firm. It also includes some
chance gains (windfall profits). While considering net profit ‘or’ pure profit, we have
to deduct all the above things from gross profit. Net profit is the reward for risk -
taking and uncertainty - bearing which are the main functions of an entrepreneur. The
monopolist is the sole seller of a commodity for which there are no substitutes. As he
controls the supply, it is possible for him to make huge profits. And this is known as
monopoly profit.
Normal profit and super normal profit (excess profit)
Pure profit (net profit) can be divided into normal profit and supernormal
profit. Normal profit is the minimum necessary to guarantee that an entrepreneur
will continue to bear uncertainty and run the firm. That part of pure profit which is in
excess of normal profit is excess or surplus profit or supernormal profit. Though firms
under perfect competition may make surplus profits in the short run, it will disappear
in the long run. Only a monopoly can earn excess profits indefinitely.
The early economists made no distinction between interest and profits
because they considered the capitalist and the entrepreneur as one and the
same person. The entrepreneur need not necessarily be the owner of capital. It is
leadership rather than ownership that is important in the case of an entrepreneur.
Today, organization has become a distinct factor of production. Profits differ from
other incomes in three ways. First, it is a residual income. Second, there may be wide
fluctuations in profits and sometimes, they may be negative. That is, there may be
losses. We cannot think of negative wages. Third, profits are uncertain.
Theories of Profit
Some of the important theories of profit are (1) the rent theory of profits (2)
The marginal productivity theory of profits ; (3) The wages theory of profits ; (4) the
dynamic theory of profits ; (5) the innovation theory of profits (6) the risk theory of
profits, and (7) the uncertainty – bearing theory of profits.
150
Rent theory of profits
1. Prof walker is the author of the rent theory of profits. In his view, profits
are the “rent of ability” and they are similar to rent. Rent arises because of
differences in fertility of land. Similarly profits arise because of differences in
ability. That is why it is called the “rent of ability”. The main criticism against
this theory is that it explains only why there are differences in profits. It does
not answer the fundamental question why there are profits as such.
2. The Marginal productivity theory of profits : The theory is an application of
the general theory of distribution. According to this theory, under perfect
competition, profits will be equal to the value of the marginal product of
organization. We can apply all the criticisms against marginal productivity
theory to this theory also.
3. The wages theory of Profits : According to Prof. Taussig, profits are not
different from wages. Profits, are the wages of the entrepreneur for his
special ability. Profits are the wages of management. The criticism against
the theory is that we can speak of negative profits (losses) but we cannot
speak of negative wages. Organization is a distinct factor of production. And
it is different from labour.
4. The Dynamic Theory of profits: Prof. Clark is the author of this theory.
According to him, profits are the result of dynamic changes in society. Clark
has defined profits as the excess of the prices of goods over their costs.
Some of the important changes relate to the size of population, supply of
capital, production techniques, industrial organization and human wants.
Though the dynamic theory is one of the modern theories of profits, “it
overlooks the fundamental question of the difference between a change that
is foreseen a reasonable time in advance and one that is unforeseen”.
5. Innovation theory of profits: According to Schumpeter, profits are the
reward for innovations. An innovation is something more than an invention.
An invention becomes an innovation only when it is applied to industrial
processes. Innovation includes introduction of new goods, or new methods
of production and opening new market. And innovations are introduced by
the entrepreneur. Change and economic development take place because
of his activities. So he gets profits for innovations. The criticism against the
theory is that though innovation is an important factor in the emergence of
profits, it cannot be the only factor. It ignores the risk-bearing function of the
entrepreneur.
6. The Risk - bearing theory of profits :- According to Prof. Hawley, profits are
the reward for an entrepreneur for risk- taking. Risk - taking is an important
function of an entrepreneur. Risk-taking and profit-making go together. The 
151
main criticism against this theory is that it does not make distinction between
known risks and unknown risks. Known risks (eg. theft, fire) can be insured
against. We may say that profits are the reward for taking unknown risks. For
there is a lot of uncertainty about such risks.
7. The uncertainity-bearing theory of profits : Professor Knight is the author
of the uncertainty - bearing theory of profits. He is of the view that “profit is
the reward not for risk - bearing but uncertainty- bearing”. His main point is
that there is risk because future is uncertain. And uncertainty - bearing is an
essential function of an entrepreneur.
The entrepreneur can insure known risks. But unknown risks (eg. competition
risks, risks of government action) cannot be insured against. These risks are
uncertain. The entrepreneur earns profits because uncertainties are borne by him.
The criticism against the theory is that uncertainty - bearing alone is not the only
function of an entrepreneur.
Conclusion : The main defect with all the above theories is that they
stress only one or two functions of the entrepreneur. In addition to risk-taking and
uncertainty-bearing, the entrepreneur performs a number of other functions. And he
deserves reward in the form of profits.

Chapter 10
Simple Theory of Income Determination
Adam Smith (1723-90), Thomas Malthus (1766-1834), David Ricardo (1772-
1823), and Jean-Baptist Say (1767-1832) were the most prominent classical
economists. Their thinking on the macro economic issues (such as income and
unemployment) has mostly been shaped by their time and circumstances of 18th
and 19th centuries. But their ideas have also influenced the thinking of subsequent
generations.
Their idea of how free market would solve unemployment was widely
accepted until the Great Depression of 1930s. The Great Depression crippled the
free enterprise economies of US and UK with high level of unemployment and glut
in the market. J.M. Keynes (1883- 1964), after having examined the depression,
had revolutionized the macro economic thinking through his writings. His ideas have
made greater impact on governments and their role in solving unemployment until
recent times. His ideas underlie all modern macro economic theories.
Classical Theory of Full Employment
The classical economists believed that the productive capacity of a country
decides how much to be produced. An economy produces as much as it can. It
assumes the existence of full employment. It has not thought of unemployment of any
factor of production, particularly labour. The confidence that market makes it possible
to sell everything that is produced is based upon Say’s law. Say’s Law of market is a
denial of the possibility of general over-production or mass unemployment deficiency
of aggregate demand in a free economy.
Say’s Law of Market
J. B. Say, a French economist, propounded his law of markets in his book,
“Treatise on Political Economy” (1803). His law can be summarized as “supply
creates its own demand”. This means that production of every good generates
sufficient income to ensure that there is enough demand for the goods produced.
Every production which brings goods to market does so only in order to
exchange them for other goods. It precisely states that whatever be the level of
output, and the income created by that will necessarily lead to an equal amount
of spending and hence deficiency of aggregate demand cannot occur. Hence,
Say rejected the view that there could be general over-production and mass
unemployment. Only full employment prevails in the economy. He made the following
assumptions.
155
1. All incomes of the households are spent on consumption of goods and services.
2. There is no government activity (no taxation, public spending, price control etc.).
3. It is a closed economy i.e. no relationship with other economies.
Whatever is produced represents the demand for another product. Additional
supply is additional demand. Thus Say’s analysis is carried on in terms of barter.
However, introduction of money in no way affects the process. In fact, moneybased
economy is more efficient than barter economy. It is true that sometimes,
misdirected production may result in temporary over-supply of a particular product in
a particular industry. Say himself admits this fact. But this disequilibrium disappears
by the operation of the self-adjusting market forces. But general over- production or
unemployment is impossible according to Say.
The essential aspects of Say’s Law can be summarized as:
1. Economy is self-adjusting
2. No general over-production or unemployment is possible
3. All idle resources are fully employed
4. There is economic interdependence between nations
5. Flexible wage rate prevails in the economy
6. Flexible rate of interest prevails in the economy
7. Money is simply a veil
8. It helps international trade and
9. No government interference is essential
Criticism of Say’s Law
Keynes has clearly exposed the weakness of Say’s law. In 1936, Keynes
brought about a revolution in economic theory attacking Say’s law. In 1930’s, Great
Depression and its effects showed that the classical theory of employment was
wrong and its foundation, the Say’s Law was unacceptable. Keynes launched a
vigorous attack on the Say’s Law. The main points of criticism of the law are:
1. Great Depression made Say’s law unpopular
2. All incomes earned are not always spent on consumption
3. Similarly whatever is saved is not automatically invested
4. The Law was based on wrong analysis of market
5. It suffers from the fallacy of aggregation
156
6. Aggregate supply and aggregate demand are not always equal
7. Rate of interest is not the equilibrating factor
8. Capitalist system is not self-adjusting always
9. Perfect competition is an unrealistic assumption
10. Money is a dominant force in the economy
11. The law is applicable only for long period
12. Say’s law holds goods only in a barter economy
Say’s law has no validity and use now, critics point out. However, the classical
theory relied on Say’s law to assure that there would always be full-employment as
a result of equality between aggregate demand and aggregate supply. In short there
cannot be deficiency of aggregate demand. Even if there is any unemployment, the
market mechanism would restore full employment.
Keynesian Theory of Income Determination
Keynes is considered to be the greatest economist of the 20th century. He
wrote several books. However, his ‘The General Theory of Employment, Interest
and Money’ (1936) won him everlasting fame in economics. The book revolutionized
macro economic thought. Keynesian economics is called the Keynesian revolution.
The central problem in macro economics is the determination of income and
employment of a nation as a whole. That is why modern economists also call macro
economics as the theory of income determination. Keynes brings out all the important
aspects of income and employment determination and Keynesian economics itself
can be called macro economics.He attacked the classical economics and effectively
rejected the Say’s Law, the very foundation of the classical theory. He believed
that in the short run, the level of income of an economy depends on the level of
employment. The higher the level of employment, higher will be the level of income.
A perusal of the basic ideas of Keynes can be clearly understood from the
brief summary in the flow chart. Total income depends on total employment which
depends on effective demand which in turn depends on consumption expenditure
and investment expenditure. Consumption depends on income and propensity to
consume. Investment depends upon the marginal efficiency of capital and the rate of
interest.

The Principle of Effective Demand
The principle of effective demand occupies a key position in the Keynesian
theory of employment. Effective demand is the ability and willingness to spend by
individuals, firms and government. The level of output produced and hence the level
of employment depends on the level of total spending in the economy.
Keynes used ‘aggregate demand and aggregate supply approach’ to explain
his simple theory of income determination. The term ‘aggregate’ is used to describe
any quantity that is a grand total for the whole economy.
158
Aggregate demand is the total demand for all commodities (goods and
services) in the economy. Aggregate supply is the total of commodities supplied in
the economy. These two factors are called by Keynes as aggregate demand function
(ADF) and the aggregate supply function (ASF).
Keynes made it clear that the level of employment depends on aggregate
demand and aggregate supply. The equilibrium level of income or output depends on
the relationship between the aggregate demand curve and aggregate supply curve.
As Keynes was interested in the immediate problems of the short run, he ignored
the aggregate supply function and focused on aggregate demand. And he attributed
unemployment to deficiency in aggregate demand.
It is important to note that all demand is not effective. According to Keynes,
effective demand is that point where the ADF and ASF are equal. ASF represents
cost and ADF represents receipts. Cost must not exceed receipt. When the
entrepreneurs find that their receipts are less than their costs, they will stop offering
employment to new workers. So long as their receipts are higher than the costs, they
will increase employment as they can increase their profits by offering more and
more employment.
As already mentioned, the point of intersection between the two curves shows
the maximum possible employment. According to Keynes, the level of employment
depends on total demand and unemployment results as a consequence of a fall in
total demand. If unemployment is to be averted, the remedy lies in increasing the
effective demand.
Aggregate Demand
The total expenditure of an economy can be divided in to four categories
of spending. They are consumption expenditure (C), investment expenditure (I),
government expenditure (G) and net expenditure on trade or net exports that is,
exports minus imports, (X- M). The aggregate demand is the sum total of all such
spending. Hence the aggregate demand function is represented as
 AD = C+ I + G + (X-M) … (1)
This function shows that the aggregate demand is equal to the sum of
expenditure respectively on consumption (C), Investment (I), Government spending
(G) and net exports (X-M). Thus aaggregate demand is the total value of all
planned expenditure of all buyers in the economy. It is the total demand for goods
and services in the economy (Y) in a specific time period. Moreover, the aggregate
demand is known as the amount of commodities people want to buy.
In the economy, as one man’s expenditure is another man’s income, the total
expenditure of the economy must be equivalent to the total income. That is Total
income(Y) = Total expenditure (AD). Since Y = AD, equation ( 1) can be written as
 Y = AD = C+ I + G + (X-M)
159
or Y = C+ I + G + (X-M) … (2)
Keynes gives all attention to the ADF. This aspect was neglected by
economists for over 100 years. Assuming that ASF is constant, the main basis of
Keynesian theory is that employment depends on aggregate demand which itself
depends on two factors:
1. Propensity to consume (Consumption function)
2. Inducement to invest (Investment function).
Consumption Function
People spend most of their income on commodities. Some spend their income
fully and some others spend a portion and keep the rest for saving. How much
the community as a whole spends and saves? It is about the relationship between
income and consumption.
The term ‘consumption function’ explains the relationship between income and
consumption. A function is the link between two or more variables. The proportion of
income spent on actual consumption at different levels of income is called propensity
to consume.

Keynes made it clear that there is a direct relation between income and
consumption. Consumption function or propensity to consume is the ratio that
measures the functional relationship between income and consumption. In
mathematical form the relation can be expressed as,
 C = a + b y …. ( 2 )
 C = 4 + .8Y
Thus a consumption function is generally described in terms of the 
160
linear equation Y = a + bY where the constant ‘a’ is the amount of autonomous
consumption and slope (b) is MPC. The rate of change in consumption due to
change in income depends on the MPC.
Equation (2) simply says that consumption (C) depends on income (Y). The
+ sign indicates that as income increases, obviously consumption will also increase.
But the rate of increase in consumption will be little less than that of the rate of
increase in income. It is because some unspent portion of the income will be saved.
This aspect is made clear in the Keynes law of consumption. He points out, “the
psychology of the community is such that when real income is increased, aggregate
consumption is increased, but not so much as income” . Keynes also made it clear
that in the short run, the consumption function is stable because consumption habits
of the people are more or less stable in short period.
All these points or the income-consumption relationship can also be expressed
in Figure 11.1. The vertical axis shows the spending on consumption indicated by
C and the horizontal axis shows income or output indicated by Y. The straight line
consumption function CC is defined in terms of equation C = 4 + .8Y.
The consumption curve CC is a short run curve. In this case consumption
takes place even when income is zero. In equation (2) 4 is the level of initial
consumption when income is zero and it is not affected by income. Even when
income is zero, people spend some minimum level either by gift or borrowing. This
consumption which is not related to income is called as autonomous consumption.
That is the reason why curve C starts from 4 on the vertical axis.
In equation (2) .8 indicates that 80 per cent of additional income is spent on
consumption and it is called as marginal propensity to consume (MPC). Thus MPC is
the ratio of change in consumption to change in income. In other words, MPC is the
rate of change in propensity to consume.
Change in consumption MPC = Change in income
Or MPC = ∆ C
∆Y
Where ∆C - Change in consumption and ∆Y - Change in income
The slope of the consumption function or any other straight line is measured
by dividing the vertical change by horizontal change. The symbol Ä represents a
change. Or slope can also be calculated as
Vertical change Slope = Horizontal change
The propensity to consume is assumed to be stable in the short run. Therefore
out of the given income how much will be spent depends on the slope of the curve.
161
In our case, .8 indicates that out of every additional income earned eighty per
cent will be spent for consumption keeping the rest for saving. In short, consumption
function relates the amount of consumption to level of income. Thus consumption of
an economy depends upon the level of income. When the income of an economy
rises, consumption also rises and vice versa. Suppose people spend more in an
economy in relation to their income, their MPC will be more.
Keynesian Law of Consumption implies the following three aspects. Thus
the concept of consumption function plays a vital role in Keynesian income
determination.
1) Increase in income and increase in consumption are not at the same proportion.
Consumption function is positive but less than one.
2) An increase in income is shared between consumption and saving.
3) Increase in income will not cause rise in consumption and saving at the same
time. If the rate of increase in savings rises, the rate of increase in consumption
will fall.
Saving Function
The portion of the income not spent on consumption is saving. Saving is
consumption forgone. If saving rises, consumption will fall. According to Keynes,
the level of saving in the economy, like consumption, depends basically on income.
The relationship between saving and income can mathematically be expressed as in
equation ( 3) and that is called as saving function.
 S = -a + by
 S = - 4 + .2Y …. ( 3 )
 Where S – Saving ; Y - Income; -a – dis-savings.
Marginal Propensity to save (MPS) is the ratio of saving to a change in
income. Thus it is the rate of change in the propensity to save.

Where ∆s - Change in saving and ∆Y - Change in income
With an increase income, if MPC tends to fall, MPS will tend to rise. If
MPC remains constant, MPS also will remain constant. Thus income consists of
consumption and saving.
Hence Y = C + S
Or MPC + MPS = 1
 MPS = 1 – MPC or
 MPC = 1 – MPS
162
In an economy where people spend less of their additional income, MPC
will be less and the CC curve will be less steep. Note that the constant (-a) is dissaving
because it is autonomous consumption which is unrelated to income. The
autonomous consumption will became zero in the long run. That is, households
cannot consume without income in the long run. Hence in the long run, the
consumption purely depends upon income and the curve C starts from origin.
Other Determinants of Consumption
Though income is the most important factor that has greater influence on
consumption, there are other factors which influence the propensity to consume.
They are:
1. Income distribution
2. Size and nature of wealth distribution
3. Age distribution of population
4. Inflation or price level
5. Government policies
6. Rate of interest
7. Expectations about price, income, etc.
8. Advertisements
9. Improvement in the living standard
10. Changes in cultural values
As discussed earlier, aggregate demand consists of two parts (if you ignore
government and external trade) namely consumption function and investment
function. However, consumption function or MPC remains constant in the short run.
Hence, Keynes placed greater emphasis on investment function.
Investment Function
Investment has a specific meaning in economics. It means additions to
the existing productive capacities (stock of fixed capital and inventories). They
include fixed equipments, machinery, building, raw materials, replacement due to
depreciation, etc. It lays down the basis for future production. Investment is the key
structural component of total spending or aggregate spending.
By investment, Keynes means real investment and not financial investment.
Investment is the addition to real capital assets. It does not mean the purchase of
bonds or shares which are financial investment. The distinction between consumption
and investment is fundamental in Keynesian theory. Importance of investment
as a component of aggregate demand rises due to the fact that it is another major
component.
163
Consumption is a stable function of income. So it was not possible to
change aggregate demand by changing consumption expenditure as it depends on
income. Keynes found that investment is an autonomous expenditure determined
independently of the level of income. He found it to be the major cause for the
variation and instability in income and employment. The worldwide depression of
1930s was also caused by a fall in investment.
Determinants of Investment
According to Keynes, employment depends on investment. Employment
fluctuates on account of fluctuations in investment. Therefore, we must discuss what
determines the amount of investment. Investment spending is determined by
1. Expectations of future profitability or business confidence and
2. Rate of interest
Firms invest either from their own profits or by borrowing. Households having
saving, have to decide whether to invest the money for profit or lend/deposit for
interest. If the expected profit is higher than the rate of interest, then the households
will invest. Otherwise they will lend or deposit their money for interest. Firms who
invest their own profit will also decide in the same manner. Suppose the firms
borrow for investment, then they have to pay interest for that. Hence, firms will invest
borrowed money only when the expected profit is high enough to pay the interest and
the cost of initial capital.
Thus, in all the above cases, the decision to invest will be based on the rate of
interest and business confidence. Of these two, business confidence or expectations
about future profitability has got greater significance than the rate of interest. This is
because rate of interest is stable in the short run. The expectations about profitability
involves several considerations of the future about which there cannot be any
certainty. Bleak prospects will lead to a reduction of investment and it will affect
employment and vice versa.
Savings and Investment
Another important concept in this regard is savings. It is directly connected
with investment. Saving and investment are the basic economic activities of an
economy. Saving is inevitable for capital formation and economic growth. Saving
itself has nothing to do with economic growth unless savings are properly mobilized
and effectively channelised and invested to enhance capital stock to increase
production and wealth of the economy. Thus aggregate savings and investment are
equal.
But they may not be always in equilibrium. The classical economists believed
that savings were automatically invested. They thought the decisions to save and
the decisions to invest were made by the same persons. But Keynes argued that
saving and investment were made by different persons for different reasons and were 
164
influenced by different factors. Thus, sometimes savings might exceed investment.
When this happened, there would be deficiency of aggregate demand and general
unemployment.
Keynes thought the gap between S and I could be filled by government
intervention either directly by increasing government expenditure or indirectly by
actions influencing the supply of money
 Thus S = I
 Therefore Y = C + I
 Or Y = C + S
Rate of interest: Liquidity Preference Theory
Any business move has to take into consideration a vital factor which
influences the current supply of money, namely interest. The rate of interest is
another major determinant that influences aggregate investment. In fact, the
Keynesian theory of employment begins with the rate of interest. Interest affects
investment and employment. Keynes propounded his famous liquidity preference
theory of interest to explain the necessity, justification and importance of interest.
The concept of liquidity preference is a remarkable contribution of Keynes. According
to Keynes, the rate of interest is “the reward for parting with liquidity for a specified
period”.
Liquidity preference refers to the cash holdings of the people. Liquidity means
cash. Why do people hold cash? It is because money is the most liquid asset and
people prefer to keep their wealth in the form of cash. Keynes gives three motives for
the liquidity preference of the people. They are
1) Transaction motive
2) Precautionary motive and
3) Speculative motive
In order to carry on day-to-day transactions, people prefer to keep cash. It is
governed by the transaction motive. To meet unforeseen expenditure like sudden
medical expenses, people hold cash. It is determined by precautionary motive.
To take advantage of market movements of prices of bonds, shares, etc. people
keep cash and in this case the speculative motive determines their cash holdings.
‘Speculative motive refers to the object of securing profit from knowing better than
the market what the future will bring forth’ (Keynes).
Liquidity preference depends on rate of interest. Higher the rate of interest,
people would like to take advantage and so will part with their cash. Therefore
we can say that higher the rate of interest, lower will be the liquidity preference of
the people. On the other hand, lower the rate of interest, higher will be the liquidity
preference.
165
According to Keynes, the liquidity preference is more stable as it depends on
human habits which remain same. Liquidity preference relates to the demand for
money. It is important to note that it influences the demand side in determining the
price of capital . The other side is the supply of money which depends on government
monetary policy, and credit creation by commercial banks.
Briefly stated, the Keynesian investment function gives immense importance
to the rate of interest. If the rate of interest remains constant, then investment
increases with an increase in the business confidence about the future.
Simple Income Determination
According to Keynes, the level of income of a country in the short run will
change as a result of change in employment. The level of employment depends on
aggregate demand and aggregate supply. The equilibrium level of income depends
on the balance between aggregate demand and aggregate supply. Full employment
prevails when there is equality between these two. Thus the model can be used to
show the determination of income, output and employment.
Assumptions
Keynes made the following assumption to explain income determination in a
simple way.
1. There are only two sectors viz. consumers ( C ) and firms ( I ).
2. Government influence on the economy is nil. In other words government
expenditure ( G ) is zero. As there is no taxation, all personal income will
become disposable income.
3. The economy is a closed one without any influence of foreign trade (X-M) that is,
X-M is zero.
4. Wages and prices remain constant.
5. There are unemployed resources and hence less than full employment
equilibrium prevails.
6. There is no variation in the rate of interest.
7. Investment is autonomous and it has no effect on price level or rate of interest.
8. The consumption expenditure is stable.
Due to the first three assumptions the basic equation
 Y = C + I + G + X-M
 has been reduced to Y = C + I
In Figure 10.2, vertical axis measures total or aggregate demand (or
aggregate expenditure). Horizontal axis measures income and output. You have 
166
learnt in National Income lesson (Plus One) that in the aggregate economy, income,
expenditure and output are equal. Hence they are measured in the same axis.
Aggregate supply is the total value of all commodities that the firms intend to
supply (produce). This purely depends on available technology, resources (material
and human), efficiency of labour, etc. Most of these factors change only in the long
run and remain constant in the short run. As the aggregate supply curve represents
equality of total income and output, the 45-degree line is drawn from the origin
representing AS curve. The 45-degree line divides the quadrant into two equal halves
with equal distance from the two axes. Every point on the line indicates equal amount
of income, output and expenditure ( Y = E ). The importance of this is that if any other
line intersects the 45-degree line, the point of intersection will show an equal amount
of income, output and expenditure.
Aggregate demand represents the total expenditure on consumption and
investment (or total expenditure). The aggregate demand (expenditure) curve is the
combination of consumption and investment function. In Figure 10.2, C represents
consumption function. When investment is added, it becomes C+I. The value of
investment is shown by the vertical distance between C and C+I curves.
Thus Aggregate Expenditure (AD) = C + I
Equilibrium occurs at the point of intersection of aggregate demand and
aggregate supply. At point E the planned total spending (or aggregate demand) by
consumers( C ) and investors ( I ) is equal to the total amount of national income
( Y = C + I ). The equilibrium level of output also determines the equilibrium level
of employment. Hence, at point E, we get equilibrium level of income, output and
employment.
167
The equilibrium level of employment need not correspond to full employment.
If any of the components of aggregate demand rises at each level of income, for
example, because government increases its expenditure, that shifts the entire AD line
upward. This raises equilibrium income and output. Similarly, if any one component of
AD falls, that shifts the line downward and lowers equilibrium output.
Multiplier: Ultimate determinant of Income and Employment
We have dealt with the immediate determinants of income and employment
namely, consumption spending and investment spending (C+I). Among them
autonomous consumption and investment are not related to income. The ultimate
determinant of income and employment is the multiplier. Any increase in investment
increases income manifold due to multiplier effect. Thus the concept of multiplier
expresses the relationship between an initial investment and the final increment in
the GNP. That is, the magnified or amplified effect of initial investment on income is
called as the multiplier effect. It is measured by the ratio of change in equilibrium
income to change in expenditure.
change in equilibrium income
Multiplier (K) = change in expenditure
∆Y Or K = ∆I
whereas DY - change in equilibrium income; DI - change in expenditure
Thus, K is the co-efficient that shows the number of times at which income
increased due to increase in investment. K can also be calculated by another way.
K = 1
MPS where MPS = marginal propensity to save
or
K = 1
1 - MPC where MPC = marginal propensity to consume.
Government Spending
We have discussed the simple income determination only with two kinds of
expenditure. One is consumption expenditure (C) to produce consumer goods.
Second is investment expenditure (I) to produce capital goods. The third component
is the public expenditure (G) made by government. It is made to produce public
goods like literacy, public health, child nutrition, social welfare and many more for the
collective well-being of the society.
The classical economists held the view that government was unproductive.
Keynes rejected their idea and argued that government activities (taxing and
spending) strongly influence the level of economy. Taxation and public spending can
be used to achieve macro goals like growth and economic stability. Such usage is
called fiscal policy.
168
Keynes proved that fiscal policy is more effective in recovering economies
from depression. Public expenditure can be used to increase effective demand during
depression. The injection of money in the economy will generate demand and this
will increase investment and employment. Thus public expenditure will put back the
economy again on its growth path.
Many countries have adopted his policy suggestions and recovered from
the Great Depression of 1930s. Since then the role of government and fiscal policy
became important in macroeconomic management.
Principle of Acceleration
According to the theory of multiplier, the increase in investment generates
manifold increase in income. Such increases in income increases consumption. The
initial increase in demand automatically gathers momentum. The available productive
capacities will be exhausted fully. This in turn encourages more investment to meet
the expanding demand. As the existing productive capacity would not be enough
to meet the expanding demand, productive capacities will be expanded by new
investments.
Thus the level of investment depends upon the rate of change in income
and the resultant change in consumption. This is what called as the principle of
accelerator. According to this principle, net investment is positively related to changes
in income.
The theory of multiplier states the effect of investment upon the level of
income. The principle of accelerator states that the effect of an increase in income
upon the level of investment.
Money and Interest
Keynes represented a monetary theory of interest. It is known as the liquidity
preference theory of interest. Interest, according to Keynes, is payment for the use
of money. The demand for money (liquidity preference) and the supply of money,
determine the rate of interest. The essence of the Keynesian theory of liquidity
preference is that the quantity of money, along with the state of liquidity preference
determines the rate of interest.
Keynes made it clear that interest is not the reward for savings as assumed by
the classical writers. The rate of interest is the “reward for parting with liquidity for a
period”. In other words, the rate of interest is largely determined by the attitude of the
people to part with liquidity if their liquidity preference is strong.

Chapter 11
Monetary Policy
Introduction
Before we study monetary policy, we shall study about the nature and
functions of money. Money has become so important that the modern economy is
described as money economy. Modern economy cannot work without money. Even
in the early stages of development, the need for exchange arose. But exchange took
place first in the form of barter. Barter is the direct exchange of goods for goods.
It is a system of trading without the use of money. In the past when wants of men
were a few and simple, the barter system worked well. But as days passed by, it was
found to be unsuitable. It had many difficulties. For example, barter requires double
coincidence of wants. That is, a person must have what the other person wants
and vice versa. And this is not always possible. For instance, if a person who has a
cow wants a horse in exchange, the other person must have it and he must need a
cow. Otherwise exchange cannot take place. Again, there is the difficulty of storage.
Money serves as a store of value. In the absence of money, a person has to store his
wealth in the form of commodities and they cannot be stored for a long period. For
some commodities are perishables and some will lose their value.
2. Functions of Money
Money has overcome the difficulties of barter. Crowther, has defined money
as “anything that is generally acceptable as a means of exchange (i.e, as a means of
settling debts) and that at the same time acts as a measure and as a store of value”.
An important point about this definition is that it regards anything that is generally
acceptable as money. Thus money includes coins, currency notes, cheques, bills
of exchange, credit cards and so on. That is why prof. Walker has said: “money is
that which money does”. By this, he has referred to the functions of money. Money
performs many functions in a modern economy. The most important functions of
money are given in the form of a couplet quoted below :-
“Money is a matter of functions four
A medium, a measure, a standard, a store”.
Thus, money, is a medium of exchange, a measure of value, a store of value
and a standard of deferred payments.
1. Medium of exchange : The most important function of money is that it acts as
medium of exchange. Money is accepted freely in exchange for all other goods.
Barter system is very inconvenient. So the introduction of money has got over
the difficulty of barter.
173
2. Measure of value : Money acts as a common measure of value. It is a unit
of account and a standard of measurement. Whenever we buy a good in the
market we pay a price for it in money. And price is nothing but value expressed
in terms of money. So we can measure the value of a good by the money we
pay for it. Just as we use yards and metres for measuring length and kilograms
for measuring weights, we use money for measuring the value of goods. It
makes economic calculations easy.
3. Store of value : A man who wants to store his wealth in some convenient form
will find money admirably suitable for the purpose. It acts as a store of value.
Suppose the wealth of a man consists of a thousand cattle. It is rather difficult
for him to preserve his wealth in the form of cattle. But if there is money, he can
sell his cattle, get money for that and can store his wealth in the form of money.
4. Standard of deferred payments : Money is used as a standard for future
(deferred) payments. It forms the basis for credit transactions. Business in
modern times is based on credit to a large extent. This is facilitated by the
existence of money. In credit, since payment is made at a future date, there
must be some medium which will have as far as possible the same exchange
power in the future as at present. If credit transactions were to be carried on the
basis of commodities, there would be a lot of difficulties and it will affect trade.
Money, to be used as a medium of exchange, must be universally acceptable.
All people must accept a thing as money. Or, the Government should give it legal
sanction. And for performing the other two functions, that is, to be used as a store of
value and standard of deferred payments, money should have stability of value. In
other words, the value of money should not change often.
Importance of Money : Money is one of the most fundamental inventions of
mankind “Every branch of knowledge has its fundamental discovery. In mechanics, it
is the wheel, in science fire, in politics the vote. Similarly in economics, in the whole
commercial side of Man’s social existence, money is the essential invention on which
all the rest is based (Crowther).
Money is indispensable in an economy whether it is capitalistic or socialistic.
Price mechanism plays a vital role in capitalism. Production, distribution and
consumption are influenced to a great extent by prices, and prices are measured in
money. Even a socialist economy, where the price system does not play so important
a role as under capitalism, cannot do without money. For a while, the socialists talked
of ending the money, i.e, abolishing money itself, because they considered money as
an invention of the capitalists to suppress the working class. But later on they found
that even under a system of planning, economic accounting would be impossible
without the help of money.
174
In the early stages of civilization, different people used different things as
money. Cattle, tobacco, shells, wheat, tea, salt, knives, leather, animals such as
sheep, horses and oxen and metals like iron, lead, tin and copper have been used
as money. Gradually precious metals such as gold and silver replaced other metals
such as iron, copper and bronze as money. And now paper is used as money. We
may describe one more form of money, that is, bank deposits which go from person
to person by means of cheques.
Money supply
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is the central bank of our country. It manages
the monetary system of our country. It has classified the money supply of our country
into four components.
They are :
M1 = Currency with the public. It includes coins and currency notes + demand
deposits of the public. M1
 is also known as narrow money ;
M2
 = M1
 + post office savings deposits ;
M3 = M1 + Time deposits of the public with the banks. M3 is also known as broad
money ; and
M4 = M3 + total post office deposits.
Note : Besides savings deposits, people maintain fixed deposits of different maturity
periods with the post office.
Reserve Money
Reserve Money (RM) may be considered as Government money. (In this
context, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is also taken as Government). Reserve
money is the cash held by the public and the banks.
It is composed of
C = currency with the public in circulation
OD = other deposits of the public with the RBI (OD) (The public regard their deposits
with the RBI as cash or money) and
CR = cash reserves of banks. Cash reserves are composed of two parts :- They are
(1) cash reserves with banks themselves and (2) Bankers deposits with RBI.
Thus,
Reserve Money (RM) = C+ OD + CR
175
We may note that the simple theory of money supply states that supply
of money (M) is an increasing function of reserve money (RM). In other words, as
Reserve Money changes, supply of money also changes.
The Reserve money is also called high powered money on account of its great
influence on money supply.
Fiat Money : Currency notes in circulation are normally referred to as fiat money. For
example, one Rupee notes issued by the Government of India is Fiat money.
The notes issued by the RBI are usually referred to as bank notes. They are
in the nature of promissory notes.
Monetary Policy
The basic goals of macroeconomic policy in most of the countries are
full employment, price stability, rapid economic growth, balance of payments
equilibrium and economic justice. Economic justice refers to equitable distribution of
income. The government tries to achieve the goals through macroeconomic policy.
Macroeconomic policy can be broadly divided into monetary policy and fiscal policy.
Of course, the government follows other policies such as industrial policy, agricultural
policy, tariff policy and so on. But we limit our discussion only to monetary policy
and the fiscal policy. In the present chapter, we shall study the monetary policy with
reference to our country.
“Monetary policy is policy that employs the central bank’s control over the
supply and cost of money as an instrument for achieving the objectives of economic
policy” (Edward Shapiro).
Instruments of Monetary Policy
Roughly we may say that monetary policy is credit control policy. The
instruments of credit control can be broadly divided into :
(1) Quantitative credit control measures ; and
(2) Selective credit control measures.
Quantitative credit control instruments include bank rate policy, variation of cash
reserve ratios and open market operations.
1. Bank Rate : The Bank rate is the minimum rate at which the central bank of a
country will lend money to all other banks. Suppose, there is too much of money in
circulation. Then the central bank should take some money out of circulation. It can
do it by increasing the bank rate. When the bank rate goes up, the rates charged
by other banks go up. The belief is that if the rate of interest goes up, businessmen
will be discouraged to borrow more money and producers will borrow less money for
investment. Generally, to control inflation, the central bank will increase the bank rate.
176
2. Variation of cash Reserve Ratios : The ability of a commercial bank to create
credit depends upon its cash reserves. The central bank of a country has the power
to vary the cash reserve ratios. During inflation, to check the sharp rise in commodity
prices and to control credit, the central bank can make use of this weapon.
3. Open Market Operations : In India, the open market operations have been
conducted in Central Government securities and State Government securities. The
success of open market operations as a weapon of credit control, depends mainly
on (i) the possession by the central bank of adequate volume of securities ; (2) the
presence of well developed bill (securities) market ; and (3) stability of cash reserve
ratios maintained by commercial banks. These things are missing to a great degree
in India. So, open market operations have not become a powerful weapon of credit
control in our country. They have been largely used in India more to assist the
Government in its borrowing operations rather than controlling credit.
Selective credit controls
Selective credit controls can play an important role in an under- developed
money market with a planned economy. Unlike the instruments of quantitative credit
control, the selective instruments affect the types of credit extended by commercial
banks. They not only prevent flow of credit into undesirable channels, but also
direct the flow of credit into useful channels. The Reserve Bank of India had started
applying the selective credit controls since 1955.
The weapons of selective credit controls include (a) Fixing minimum margin
of lending or for purchase of securities. (For example, shares or commodities like
foodgrains and raw materials which are in short supply). In this case, the central bank
specifies the fraction of the purchase price of securities that must be paid in cash.
Unlike general controls, selective controls make it possible for the central bank to
restrain what is regarded as an unhealthy expansion of credit. (eg. for financing the
purchase of securities or automobiles) ;
b) Ceiling on the amount of credit for expansion and
c) Different rates of interest will be charged to encourage certain sectors and to
discourage certain other sectors. In our country, the last weapon has been
used especially, to encourage exports, agricultural production and production
in small scale and cottage industries sector.
d) The central bank will persuade the commercial banks to follow certain
policies through moral suasion.
Conclusion : Monetary policy is usually effective for controlling inflation. But during
the Great Depression of 1930s, it was found to be ineffective. So Keynes suggested
a bold and dynamic fiscal policy to tackle the problems of mass unemployment
and bad trade characterized by falling prices and deficiency in aggregate demand. 
177
But since 1970s, the world has been facing the problem of stagflation marked by
stagnation and lack of demand on the one hand and inflation on the other. In the
case of stagflation, both monetary policy and fiscal policy are found to be ineffective.
So incomes policy such as voluntary restraint on wages by employees, and on prices
by producers have been suggested as a complement to the monetary policy and the
fiscal policy.
In India, the usual methods of credit control are not operative in an effective
manner. The main reasons for the ineffectiveness of the monetary policy of the RBI
is this. Two main conditions essential for the success of the credit policy are the
dependence of the money market upon commercial banks and dependence of the
commercial banks on the central bank for their funds. Both these conditions have
been only partially fulfilled in India. That is why, the credit control measures of RBI
have not been totally effective in India. Not only that, in recent times unaccounted
money (black money) has been used for financing speculative dealings.
Monetary Transmission
The transmission mechanism tells that monetary policy affects income through
the interest rate and investment. It is the process by which money supply affects
income. Let us suppose that the government follows cheap money. The central bank,
for example, may reduce the bank rate. This will result in a fall in the market rate
of interest. Then the investment will go up. This, in turn, will increase employment
and income. The increase in money supply can also be caused by variation of cash
reserve ratios and open market operations.

Fig. 11.1 illustrates how transmission mechanism works. Part A of the diagram
tells that when there is a fall in the rate of interest from r1 to ro,money supply 
178
increases from Mo to M1. As a result of the fall in the rate of interest and increase in
the supply of money, investment increases from I0
 to I1
 as shown in Fig. 11.1 (b). The
increase in investment results in increase in income from Yo
 to Y1
. as shown in fig.
11.1(c)
Many modern economists argue that this view of transmission mechanism is
rather narrow. They say that like investment, consumption may vary with the interest
rate. The classical economists assumed that consumption is inversely related to the
rate of interest. If we accept that view, a fall in the interest rate will cause an increase
in consumption. Since consumption is a component of aggregate demand, aggregate
demand increases. This in turn, will increase the equilibrium level of income. If both
consumption and investment increase, income will increase by a greater amount than
if only investment increases.
The monetary economists further argue that monetary policy may also affect
income by altering net private wealth.
Net Private wealth may be defined as society’s capital stock, money supply,
and government debt (government debt includes treasury bills, notes and bonds).
And consumption is positively related to net private wealth. If the nominal money
supply increases and price level is constant, the real money supply increases. Since
it is a component of net private wealth, wealth increases, and in turn consumption
increases. When consumption increases, aggregate demand increases and the
equilibrium level of income increases. It may be noted that wealth and consumption
increase without regard to changes in the rate of interest. It follows that monetary
policy is effective even in the liquidity trap. According to Keynes, liquidity trap refers
to a situation in which an increase in the money supply does not result in a fall in the
interest rate but merely in an addition to idle balances.
Dear Money
When there is inflation in a country, the central bank tries to control it by
following dear money policy. The term “Dear Money” refers to a phase or policy when
interest rates are high.
Cheap Money
“Cheap Money” denotes a phase in which loans are available at low rates of
interest or a policy which creates this situation. Cheap money policy is followed by a
central bank during a period of depression to increase the supply of money so as to
stimulate investment.
Value of money
By “Value of Money” we mean the purchasing power of money. The
purchasing power of money depends upon the price level. A general rise in the price
level indicates a fall in the value of money and a general fall in prices indicates a rise
in the value of money.
179
The Quantity Theory of Money and the Equation of Exchange
The Quantity Theory of Money was formulated by Irving Fisher. In its original
form, the quantity theory states, “prices always change in exact proportion to
changes in the quantity of money. If the amount of money is doubled, prices double.
If the amount of money is halved, prices fall to half their original level”. The main
point about the quantity theory is that price level changes because of changes in the
quantity of money.
Equation of Exchange : The quantity theory of money has been put forward in
the form of an equation known as the “Equation of Exchange”. It is also known
as Fisher’s equation. The equation of exchange states that if ‘M’ is the amount of
money, ‘V’ is the velocity of circulation of money, ‘P’ is the price level and ‘T’ is the
volume of trade, then MV = PT (or P = MV/T)
This is known as the equation of exchange. Velocity of circulation (V) refers
to the number of times that each unit of money is used during a given period. The
equation tells when the supply of money increases, other things being equal, there
will be a rise in the price level. That means a fall in the value of money. For example,
when ‘M’ is doubled,’P’ will be doubled.
Now a days, a large proportion of money consists of cheques, bills and other
forms of credit instruments. So some economists are of the opinion that the above
types of money should be taken into account while considering the quantity of money.
So the Equation of Exchange has been modified as follows :-
PT = MV + M1
V1
 where M1
 is the total amount of all forms of cheques, bills
and other instruments of credit in circulation and V1
 is the velocity of circulation of M1
(credit instruments) The main criticism against the quantity theory of money is that
it is based on the assumption of full employment. But if full employment is not there
and if there are unemployed resources, an increase in the quantity of money will not
generally increase prices. Again, during depression, all prices fall. Even if the quantity
of money is increased at that time, prices will not rise. In spite of the above criticism,
we may note that the quantity theory of money is a statement of tendency and it
indicates in a crude way the relationship between prices and the quantity of money.
Changes in price level may be influenced by many things other than the
quantity of money such as Government’s monetary policy and fiscal policy, the supply
of goods in the given period, the volume of trade, changes in the incomes of the
people and effective demand for goods. One way of studying about changes in prices
is to study about inflation and deflation.
Inflation and Deflation
The terms ‘inflation’ and ‘deflation’ are not easy to define. Different economists
have defined them in different ways. Crowther has given us the most simple and 
180
useful definition of these terms. According to Crowther, “Inflation is a state in which
the value of money is falling, i.e, prices are rising”. So it is generally regarded that
during a period of inflation, the price level will rise. It is also described as a situation
where too much money chases too few goods resulting in an abnormal increase
of price level. Shapiro has defined inflation as “a persistent and appreciable rise in
the general level of prices”. And Harry Johnson has defined it as a “sustained rise
in prices”. However, we should remember one important point. That is, there can be
inflation even without a rise in the price level. This is known as ‘Repressed Inflation’.
Usually this happens during a war period. On account of many controls and rationing
that exist during wartime, prices will be kept under check. But the moment controls
are withdrawn, prices will go up. So the real test of inflation is neither an increase
in the amount of money nor a rise in prices, but the appearance of abnormal profits.
Whenever businessmen and producers make huge profits, it is a sign of inflation.
Types of Inflation
1. Demand – Pull Inflation : It is loosely described as “too much money chasing too
few goods”. This refers to the situation where general price level rises because
the demand for goods and services exceeds the supply available at the existing
prices.
Creeping or Persistent inflation : Since the end of world War II, i.e. since 1945,
there has been a tendency for prices and wages to push one another upwards. This
situation has been described as creeping or persistent inflation.
Runaway or Galloping or Hyper – Inflation
This is a serious type of inflation. For example, it was experienced in Germany
after World War I and in Hungary and China after World War II. In this situation,
prices rise to a very great extent at high speed and high prices have to be paid even
for cheap things. And money becomes quite worthless and new currency has to be
introduced. This situation is known as galloping inflation or hyper-inflation.
2. Cost – Push Inflation
Cost – push inflation is induced by rising costs, including wages, so that rising
wages and other costs push up prices. We can also speak of wage inflation or price
inflation when we mean increase in wages or prices.
Bottleneck Inflation : This refers to inflation that results from shortages, imbalances
and rising marginal costs as full employment output is approached.
Profit – Push Inflation - Just as trade unions manage to push up wages,
oligopolists and monopolists will raise prices more than enough to cover increase in
costs with the aim of making monopoly profits.
181
Generally during war and in the post- war period, there will be inflation. This
is so because during war, the incomes of people increase. But there will be shortage
of goods and there may be rationing, control and things like that. So during the post -
war years, people who have been forced to save money will spend. That is, demand
for all sorts of goods will increase during that period but supply will not increase so
fast as that. This leads to inflation. Inflation occurs during war because the one great
aim at that time is that of winning the war. Since modern wars are so expensive,
the Government has to depend upon created money to finance war. This leads to
inflation. And inflation breeds inflation. It means that inflation leads to inflation. During
a period of inflation, prices will be high. Since prices are high, workers will demand
high wages. High wages result in high costs. High costs in turn lead to high prices.
Thus it forms a vicious circle. “Wages force up prices ; prices force up wages”. This
is the inflationary spiral. “Deficit financing” is another cause of inflation. This applies
particularly to underdeveloped countries with planned economies. Inflationary trends
can be noticed also during the boom period of a trade cycle.
Since inflation has many evils, every government tries to check it. Inflation
has destroyed many economies. For example the inflation that took place in 1923 in
Germany destroyed her economic system. Inflation can be checked by some or all of
the following measures.
(1) Increased taxation (2) By reducing government expenditure on capital projects.
(In India, this measure has been suggested to check inflation. Many capital
projects proposed in our Third Five Year Plan were either suspended or dropped
completely. (3) Restrictions on imports. (4)Rationing and (5) Price controls.
Sometimes a “wage freeze’ is recommended to check inflation. That is, trade
unions will be requested not to ask for an increase in wages during a given
period. The success of the above measures in tackling inflation depends upon
the efficiency of the government in implementing the measures.
Deflation : Crowther, defines deflation as a “state in which the value of money is
rising, i.e., prices are falling”. Both inflation and deflation refer to the movement
of prices. Deflation is the opposite of inflation. Generally inflation is a period
characterized by rising activity and employment. But during deflation, there will be
bad trade and unemployment. During deflation, since prices fall faster than costs,
there will be heavy losses for producers and businessmen. There will not be profits
in any branch of economic activity. So there will be a fall in investment. This results
in unemployment. Both inflation and deflation are evils. There is nothing much
to choose between them. While rising prices can be checked to some extent by
the monetary policy of the government, the latter is of little help in raising the price
level during deflation. It does not work. That is why during such periods, modern
economists suggest that the State must play an active role in the economic field
and step up economic activity by undertaking a series of public works programmes. 
182
“Wage- cut” is sometimes recommended as a remedy for depression. But it is not a
correct solution. It will only make matters worse.
Effects of changes in prices
Changes in prices affect different sections of the community in different ways.
They affect production and distribution too.
1. Effects on production
If prices are rising, it will stimulate production. Under a capitalistic system,
production is carried on mainly for profits. During a period of rising prices (inflation),
there will be abnormal profits. This increases production. So manufacturers and
businessmen gain during inflation. Producers and businessmen gain during inflation.
Producers gain by inflation because during that period prices rise faster than costs.
So they make huge profits. But if inflation becomes hyper-inflation, it may end in a
crash. On account of the rapid fall in the value of money, profits which are in the form
of money may become worthless. And there will be a “flight from currency”. Inflation
may become an important cause of “violent revolutions and economic chaos”.
In a period of falling prices, businessmen incur huge losses because prices
fall faster than costs. And there will be little scope for investment. This results in
unemployment on large scale. There will be business depression. During depression,
money may be cheaply available, prices of materials will be low, men will be available
for work but there will be no investment, no employment, no incomes and no demand
for goods. Such a situation has been described as ‘poverty in the midst of plenty.’ The
Great Depression of 1930s is a case in point.
2. Effects on Distribution
a) Business class : During inflation, manufacturers and businessmen make huge
profits. Of course, during deflation, they make losses.
b) Fixed income groups : People in fixed income groups are hit hard in times of
inflation. The incomes of wage earners and salaried people such as teachers,
clerks and judges do not increase as fast as prices. Even retired people getting
pension are also affected during inflation.
Wage earners and salaried – people gain during a period of falling prices.
But it is not a real gain because many people will lose their jobs during deflation.
Unemployment is a worse evil than rising prices.
c) Investors : people who have invested their money in “gilt edged” securities
(government securities) will get only fixed income. So their position is like those
in the fixed income group. But those who have shares in companies will make
profits during a period of rising prices and lose during a period of falling prices.
In Germany, thousands of middle class families were ruined during the inflation 
183
because all their lifetime savings were reduced to nothing by the tremendous
rise in prices. If the value of money falls continuously, it becomes unsuitable as a
store of value. People will not save at all.
d) Rentiers : Rentiers gain during deflation and lose during inflation. But the gain
during deflation is only a temporary feature.
It can be seen from the above discussion that violent changes in prices are a
bad thing. Both inflation and deflation are great evils. “Inflation is unjust and deflation
is inexpedient” (disadvantageous). Some economists believe that of the two,
deflation is worse because it results in unemployment. That is why it is now generally
agreed that a steadily rising price level is a good thing for economic progress and
social justice. We may agree with Robertson when he says that “money which is a
source of so many blessings to mankind, becomes also, unless we can control it, a
source of peril and confusion”.

Chapter 12
Fiscal Policy
Public finance or government finance is a field of economics. It deals with
budgeting the revenues and expenditures of government (or public sector). It is about
the identification of and appraisal of the means and effects of government financial
policies. Public finance deals with the financing of the State activities and it discusses
the financial operations of the public treasury. Fiscal economics is another name for
public finance.
The functions of the government were minimal in the early days of the
development of economic philosophy. The economic decisions were guided by
the market forces of demand and supply and the government was not expected to
interfere with the working of the market forces. Earlier governments limited their
activities to a) the maintenance of law and order b) the defence of the country c)
administration of justice d) general administration. The early State was a police State.
Modern governments do not confine their activities to the barest minimum.
Besides the activities performed by the early State, modern governments undertake
a number of growth and development-oriented projects and welfare activities for the
well-being of the people. The modern State is a Welfare State. Therefore there is a
change in the concept of a modern State which is a welfare State. The State has to
mobilize adequate resources for meeting out the ever increasing expenditures, as the
responsibilities and functions of the State have multiplied.
Fiscal economics in the modern days has undergone far-reaching changes.
These changes can also be studied through macro aspects of fiscal policy. It relates
to macro economic functions of the government. It is concerned with the taxation,
public expenditure and monetary policy which affects the overall level of employment
and price level. It may be noted that there is a link between economic theory and the
theory of public finance.
Definition
Economists have defined public finance differently. The following are some of
the popular definitions:
According to Dalton, “Public finance is concerned with the income and
expenditure of public authorities and with the adjustment of the one with the other”.
Findlay Shirras says that, “Public finance is the study of the Principles
underlying the spending and raising of funds by public authorities”.
To quote Lutz, “Public finance deals with the provision, custody, and
disbursement of resources needed for the conduct of public or government
functions”.
187
We may conclude from the above definitions that Public Finance or Fiscal
Economics is concerned with the principles and practices of obtaining funds and
spending the same for achieving the maximum social welfare and economic growth
in the country.
Subject matter of public finance
The following subdivisions form the subject matter of public finance
1. Public expenditure
2. Public Revenue
3. Public debt
4. Financial administration and
5. Federal finance
1. Public expenditure
Since the modern government represents a welfare state, the responsibility of
the government is to bring about maximum social welfare. In addition to this, it has to
perform various other functions, which require heavy expenditures. We study in this
sub-division, the fundamental principles governing the flow of government funds into
different spending streams and the methods of incurring expenditure on the various
activities.
2. Public Revenue
Public revenue means different sources of government’s income. It deals with
the methods of raising revenue for the government, principles of taxation and other
related problems. Raising of tax revenue and non- tax revenue is the subject matter
of public revenue. Tax revenue deals with the kinds of taxes and the impact and
incidence of various taxes. Non-tax revenue includes
i.) Commercial revenue (income earned through sale of goods and services and
profits earned by public sector enterprises),
ii.) Administrative revenues (Fees, license fees, special assessments),
iii) Gifts and grants.
3. Public debt
The problem relating to the raising and repayment of public loans is studied
under this sub-division. Borrowing by the government from the public is called
public debt. In modern world, it is not possible for the government to meet all its
expenditure through tax and non-tax revenue. Hence public revenue falls short of
public expenditure. As a result, governments are forced to borrow from internal and 
188
external sources. In the case of internal debt, Government borrows from the people,
commercial banks and the central bank. External debt includes borrowing from
international monetary institutions like IMF and World Bank and also from foreign
countries. The soundness of the borrowing policy of the governments and indication
of the healthy direction of spending are examined under this sub-division.
4. Financial administration
Financial administration is concerned with the organisation and functioning
of the government machinery that is responsible for performing various financial
activities of the state. Preparing the budget for the particular financial year is the
master financial plan of the government. The various works, starting with the
objectives of designing a budget, the methods of preparing it, presentation of the
budget before the Parliament and State Assembly, passing or sanctioning by the
Parliament, execution, auditing, implementation etc., constitute the subject matter of
financial administration.
5. Federal finance
Federal finance is a part of the study of public finance. A federation is an
association of two or more states. In a federal form of government, there are:
Central, State, and local governments. The interrelationships between these forms
of governments, and the problems related to them and the financial functions of all
these units are studied under federal finance.
Meaning and definition of a tax
A tax is one of the important sources of public revenue. A tax is a compulsory
charge or payment levied by the government on an individual or corporation.
Therefore an element of compulsion is involved in taxation. Other sources of public
revenue are excluded from this compulsory element. There is no direct give and take
relationship between a taxpayer and the government.
Definition of a tax
According to Prof. Seligman, “A tax is a compulsory contribution from the
person to the State to defray the expenditure incurred in the common interest of all
without any reference to the special benefits conferred”.
In the words of Dalton, “A tax is a compulsory contribution imposed by the
public authority, irrespective of the exact amount of service rendered to the taxpayer,
in return for which no specific and direct quid pro quo is rendered to the payer”.
From these definitions, it is clear that tax is a compulsory contribution. It
means that the State has the right to tax. Refusal to pay the tax is punishable. The
phrase ‘without quid pro quo’ means the absence of direct and proportional benefit to
the taxpayer from the government.
189
Canons of Taxation
Canons of taxation are considered as fundamental principles of taxation.
Adam Smith laid down the following canons of taxation:
a) Canon of equity
b) Canon of certainty
c) Canon of convenience
d) Canon of economy
1. Canon of equity
This canon is also called the ‘ability to pay’ principle of taxation. It means that
taxes should be imposed according to the capacity of the tax payer. Poor should be
taxed less and rich should be taxed more. This canon involves the principle of justice.
All persons contribute according to their ability. As the cost of running the government
should be equally borne by all, this canon is justified.
2. Canon of certainty
Every tax payer should know the amount of tax to be paid, when to be paid,
and where to be paid and also should be certain about the rate of tax to make
investment decisions.
3. Canon of convenience
Tax payment should be convenient and less burdensome to the tax payer. e.g.
income tax collected at source, sales tax collected at the time of sales and land tax
collected after harvest.
4. Canon of economy
This canon signifies that the cost of collecting the revenue should be kept at
the minimum possible level. The tax laws and procedures should be made simple,
so as to reduce the expenses in maintaining people’s income tax accounts. ie.
administrative expenditure to be kept at a minimum.
Kinds of tax: Taxes are of different types. They are:
1. Direct and Indirect taxes.
2. Proportional, progressive, Regressive and digressive taxes.
3. Specific and advalorem taxes.
4. Value-added tax (VAT)
5. Single and multiple taxes.
190
1. Direct and Indirect taxes
According to Dalton, “A direct tax is one which is really paid by a person on
whom it is imposed whereas an indirect tax, though imposed on a person, is partly or
wholly paid by another”.
In the case of a direct tax, the tax payer who pays a direct tax is also the tax
bearer. In the case of indirect taxes, the taxpayer and the tax bearer are different
persons.
Direct taxes
Direct taxes are collected from the public directly. That it is to say, these taxes
are imposed on and collected from the same person. One cannot evade paying the
tax if it is imposed on him.
Income tax, wealth tax, corporate tax, gift tax, estate duty, expenditure tax are
good examples of direct taxes.
Indirect taxes
Taxes imposed on commodities and services are termed as indirect taxes.
There is a chance for shifting the burden of indirect taxes. The incidence is upon the
person who ultimately pays it. Examples of indirect taxes are excise duties, customs
duties and sales taxes (commodity taxes).
The classification of direct taxes and indirect taxes is based on the criterion
of shifting of the incidence of tax. The burden of a direct tax is borne by the person
on whom it is levied. For example, income tax is a direct tax. Its burden falls on the
person who is liable to pay it to the Government. He cannot transfer the burden to
some other person.
An indirect tax is initially paid by one person but ultimately the burden of
the tax is fully or partially borne by another person. Because there is a possibility
of transfer of burden of an indirect tax. For example, the excise duty on a motorbike
is initially paid by the manufacturer. But he subsequently shifts this burden to the
consumer by including the tax in the price of the bike. Roughly, we may say that the
direct taxes are paid by the rich and the indirect taxes are paid by the poor.
Taxes of Central Government and State Governments
The financial system of India is federal in character. Therefore, the powers and
functions to raise revenue are divided between central government and state and
local governments as scheduled in the Indian Constitution. This division has been
made to avoid any clash in financial, administrative and other areas.
191
Taxes of the central government
The main sources of tax and non-tax revenue of the central government are 1.
Taxes on income (other than on agricultural income), 2. Corporate tax, 3. Expenditure
tax, 4. Taxes on properties (Estate duties and Death duties), 5. Gift tax, 6. Wealth tax,
7. Taxation on capital gains, 8. Union excise duties, and 9.Customs duties (Import
and Export duties).
The sources of non-tax revenue of the central government include1. Fiscal
services, 2. Receipts from interest on loans, 3. Dividend and profits, 4. General and
administrative services, 5. Social and community services and 6. Economic services.
Taxes of the State Governments
Under the Constitution of India, only the State governments are provided
with separate powers to raise revenue, while the Union territories are financed by
the Central government directly. The main sources of tax and non-tax revenue are
1. Land revenue, 2. Taxes on the sale and purchase of goods except newspaper,
3. Taxes on agricultural income, 4. Taxes on land and building, 5. Succession and
estate duties in respect of agricultural land, 6. Excise duty on alcoholic liquors and
narcotics, 7. Taxes on the entry of goods into a local area, 8. Taxes on mineral
rights, 9. Taxes on the consumption of electricity 10. Taxes on vehicles, animals and
boats, 11. Taxes on goods and passengers carried by road and inland water ways,
12. Stamp duties, court fees and registration, 13. Entertainment tax, 14. Taxes on
advertisements other than those in newspaper, 15. Taxes on trade, profession and
employment, 16. Income from irrigation and forests, 17. Grants from the central
government and 18. Other incomes such as income from registration and share in
the income-tax, excise and estate duties and debt services, loans and overdrafts.
Progressive, Proportional, Regressive and Digressive taxes
Direct taxes can also be classified on the basis of the degree of
progressiveness or distribution of their burden on the tax payers. Ability of the people
to pay a tax is measured on the basis of property, income, size of the family and
consumption etc. The ability to pay in practice implies tax base and tax rate. Tax base
denotes the income, property and expenditure on the basis of which ability to pay the
tax is measured. Rate structure indicates equalisation of burden of taxation. Tax rate
is the percentage of tax levied per unit of tax base. The total amount of tax is equal to
the tax base multiplied by tax rate.
On the basis of rate structure, taxes are classified as follows:
a) Proportional tax
In the case of a proportional tax, tax rate remains constant regardless of
whether the tax base is large or small. It means uniform tax rate is imposed on the
rich as well as the poor. The tax paid by the people is fixed in proportion to their
income and wealth and other tax bases.
192
b) Progressive tax
In the case a progressive tax, the tax rate increases as the tax base increases.
With the increase in income, a taxpayer has to pay a higher tax. For example, in the
case of income tax, exemption limit and tax slabs are characterised by the income
tax structure formulated by the government of India. As each income slab increases,
there is an increase in the rates of tax.
c) Regressive tax
When the tax liability on income falls with the increase in the tax payer’s
income, it is termed as a regressive tax. Here, the tax rate decreases as the tax base
increases. Under this tax system, the poorer sections of the society are taxed at
higher rates than the richer sections and hence this tax is not just or equitable.
d) Degressive tax
Degressive tax is a blend of progressive tax and proportional tax. The rate of
taxation increases upto a point. After that limit, a uniform rate is charged. Here the
rate of tax does not increase in the same proportion as the increase in income. Under
this tax system, the higher income groups make less sacrifice than the lower income
groups.
Budget
Meaning: Government’s revenue and expenditure decisions are presented
in the budget. Budget, being an essential and important element of planning and
development, provide the specific development objectives to be pursued and the
required policy direction. They are necessary because income and expenditure do
not occur simultaneously.
Thus, ‘budget’ has been defined as the annual financial statement of the
estimated receipts and proposed expenditure of the government in a financial year,
usually April 1 to March 31 of the next year.
The term budget is derived from the French word ‘Bougette’. It means ‘small
bag’. As such, the Finance minister of a country carries a bag containing abstracts of
budget papers while presenting the budget in the Parliament or a State Legislature.
The governments, both Union and State, prepare their budget every financial
year. Government budget indicates the probable income and expenditure of the
government, the financial policies, taxation measures, investment opportunities,
extent of saving, utilization of resources, mobilization of capital etc.
Definition: Various definitions have been formulated for the concept of Budget.
Prof. Dimock says, “A budget is a balanced estimate of expenditures and
receipts for a given period of time. In the hands of the administration, the budget is
record of past performance, a method of current control and a projection of future
plans”.
193
To quote Gladstone, “Budgets are not merely matters of arithmetic but in a
thousand ways go to the root of prosperity of individuals and relation of classes and
the strength of Kingdom”.
Therefore, the budget is a document containing preliminary approval plan of
public revenue and expenditures. It bridges the proposed revenue and proposed
expenditure for the budget period.
Kinds of Budget
Balanced budget and unbalanced budget
1) Balanced Budget : A balanced budget is that, over a period of time,
revenue does not fall short of expenditure. In other words government
budget is said to be balanced when its tax revenue and expenditure are
equal.
2) Unbalanced Budget (Surplus or deficit) : An unbalanced budget is
that, over a period of time, revenue exceeds expenditure or expenditure
exceeds revenue. In other words, the government’s income or tax revenue
and expenditure are not equal. When there is an excess of income over
expenditure, it is called a surplus budget. On the other hand, when there is
an excess of expenditure over income, it is a case of deficit budget.
Classical economists advocated balanced budget. But it is not always helpful
in achieving and sustaining economic growth.
Modern economists argue that an unbalanced budget is very useful for
achieving and maintaining economic stability.
Revenue Budget and Capital Budget : Budgeting is the most important constituent
of the financial administration. Preparation of the budget is one of the main
operations of budgeting. It is mandatory for the government to make a statement
of estimated receipts and expenditures which must be laid before the Parliament
every financial year. It has to distinguish expenditure on revenue account and capital
account from other expenditures. So government budget comprises Revenue Budget
and Capital Budget.
Revenue Budget : Revenue budget consists of revenue receipts of the government
(tax revenue and non-tax revenue) and the expenditure met from these revenues.
Expenditures which do not result in creation of assets are called revenue
expenditure. (e.g. current revenues and current expenditure for normal functioning of
the Government departments, interest charges on debt incurred by Govt. and other
non- developmental expenditure).
Capital budget : Majority of the government expenditures form the capital
expenditure. Capital budget consists of receipts and payments. Capital receipts
are loans raised by government from the public which are called market loans, 
194
borrowings from the RBI, sale of treasury bills, loans received from foreign
governments etc. Capital payments are expenditure on assets creation such as land,
buildings, machinery, equipment investment loans to government companies and
state governments and other developmental expenditures.
Performance budgeting
The process of fund allocation of governments in various countries has
been changed from traditional expenditure budgeting to new forms of rationalistic
budgeting, such as performance budgeting, programme budgeting and zero based
budgeting.
Under performance budgeting, various activities of the government are
identified in the budget both in financial and physical terms. This is necessary to
ascertain the relationship between input and output and to assess the performance in
relation to cost.
Performance budgeting is conceived as a system of presenting public
expenditure in terms of distinguishable divisions such as government functions,
programmes, activities and projects; such presentation would reflect the cost of
running the government.
Under this technique, funds are granted for carrying out specific amount of
work identified under a particular division. A cost-benefit approach is employed which
facilitates meaningful and purposeful allocation of funds.
This method of budget technique promotes cost consciousness as well as cost
efficiency and suggests corrections wherever required in the process of allocation of
funds.
Zero based budgeting
Traditional technique of budgeting have been found to be inadequate for the
reason that, the previous year’s cost level is taken as the base for current year’s
budget. The traditional methods have not completely addressed the problem of
efficiency in the matter of allocation of funds for various divisions. There is therefore a
need for a new technique of budgeting which devices and uses a meaningful base for
budgeting. Zero Based Budgeting is one such technique of budgeting.
In zero based budgeting, every year is considered as a new year thus
providing a connecting link between the previous year and the current year. The past
performance and programmes are not taken into account. The budget is viewed as
entirely a fresh and whole fiscal initiative i.e. from zero bases.
Zero based budgeting evaluates and prioritizes the programmes of action
at different levels. Each department has to justify its budget from its perspectives;
evaluating feasible alternatives, before final selection and execution, the funds will be
allocated for the selected programmes.
195
Fiscal policy
Meaning
Fiscal policy is the set of principles and decisions of a government regarding
the level of public expenditure and mode of financing them. It is about the effort of
government to influence the economy’s output, employment and prices by altering
the level of public expenditure, taxation and public debt. Arthur Smithies points
out, “Fiscal policy is a policy under which the government uses its expenditure and
revenue programmes to produce desirable effects and avoid undesirable effects on
the national income, production and employment”.
The Importance of Fiscal Policy
The significance of this policy was not at all recognized by economists before
the publication of Keynes’s General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money.
Keynes gave the concept of fiscal policy new meaning and operation of the public
finance a new perspective. He made it clear that taxation, public spending and public
debt are the effective instruments of public policy capable of determining the level of
output and employment.
The importance of fiscal policy in modern economies arises from the fact that
the State under democracy is called upon to play an active and important role in
promoting economic development and providing a vast number of essential public
utilities and services like drinking water, sanitation, civic services, primary education,
public health, social welfare, defence, etc. Most of these goods are characterized
by the property viz. non-marketable; that it cannot be sold in the market to the
consumer. But payment has to be regulated in another way, through taxation.
In the underdeveloped economies, public finance has to assume yet another
role, whereas in developed economies, it aims at maintaining economic stability. In
underdeveloped economies, desirous of achieving rapid economic development, the
function of public finance is to promote rapid economic development of the country,
besides maintaining economic stability.
Objectives of fiscal policy
The principal objectives of fiscal policy in an economy are as follows:
1. To mobilize resources for financing the development programmes in the
public sector
Tax policy is to be directed towards effective mobilization of all available
resources and to harness them in the execution of development programmes. This
implies, on the one hand, diversion of wasteful and luxury spending to saving and on
the other hand productive investment of increments that accrue to production as a
result of development efforts. Taxation can be a most effective means of increasing 
196
the total quantum of savings and investments in any economy where the propensity
to consume is normally high.
2. To promote development in the private sector
In a mixed economy, private sector forms an important constituent of the
economy. In spite of the growing importance of the public sector in accelerating
the process of economic development, the interest of the private sector cannot be
neglected. Therefore rebates, reliefs and liberal depreciation allowances may be
granted to boost the private sector.
3. To bring about an optimum utilization of resources
The above objective can be achieved through proper allocation of resources.
We must direct investment in the desirable channels both in the public and private
sectors by providing suitable incentives. Productive resources are, within limits
capable of being used in various ways, which may accelerate economic growth.
The available resources must find their way into the socially necessary lines of
development.
4. To restrain inflationary pressures in the economy to ensure economic
stability
The fiscal policy must be used as an instrument for dealing with inflationary
or deflationary situations. One way to achieve this is to devise a tax structure, which
will automatically counter the economic disturbances as they arise. The second is
to make changes in the tax system in order to deal with inflationary or deflationary
situations. In countries like India, it is through the direction of the public expenditure
rather than taxation that more effective action can be taken to remove the effect of a
deflationary spiral. In terms of inflation, anti-inflationary taxes such as excess profit
tax and commodity taxes on articles of both general and luxury consumption can be
imposed.
5. To improve distribution of income and wealth in the community for lessening
economic inequalities
The national income should be properly distributed so that the fruits of
development are fairly shared by all people. Equality in income, wealth and
opportunities must form an integral part of economic development and social
advance. Moreover, redistribution of income in favour of the poorer sections of the
society is essential. This can be achieved through taxation. We can also achieve this
through an increase in public expenditure for promoting welfare to the less privileged
class. Expenditure on agriculture, irrigation, education and health and medical
expenses will improve the economic conditions of the weaker sections of the society.
Fiscal policy can affect total spending. (aggregate demand determinant)
in two ways. The first is the direct change in total spending brought about by the 
197
government increasing or decreasing its own expenditure. And the second one is
increasing or reducing private spending by varying its own tax revenue.
6. To obtain full employment and economic growth
The fiscal policy to achieve full employment and to maintain stable price in the
economy has been developed in the recent past. The ineffectiveness of monetary
policy as a means to remove unemployment during the Great Depression paved the
way for the development of fiscal policy in achieving this objective. For accelerating
the rate of growth, allocation of higher proportion of the fully employed resources
is needed. Those activities increase the productive capacity of the economy.
Therefore fiscal policy is used through its tax instrument to encourage investment
and discourage consumption so that production may increase. It is also necessary
to increase capital formation by reducing the high income tax on personal income.
To increase employment, the state expenditure should be directed towards providing
social and economic overheads. The state should undertake local public works of
community development involving more labour and less capital per head.
7. Fiscal policy and capital formation
Fiscal policy such as taxes, tariffs, transfer payments, rebate and subsidies
are expected to spur long run economic growth through increased capital formation.
Capital formation is considered an important determinant of economic growth. The
economic theory tells us that the optimal amount of capital formation serves a useful
key to economic growth in developing economies. At the same time, the economic
distortions brought about by lack of adequate fiscal incentives can cause capital
formation to fall short of the socially optimal level.
Limitations to fiscal policy
Though the fiscal policy has an important place in economic development and
in particular, in the stepping up of saving and investment both in public and in private
sectors, it has the following limitations.
1) Size of fiscal measures
The budget is not a mere statement of receipts and revenues of the
government. It explains and shapes the economic structure of a country. When the
budget forms a small part of the national income in developing economies, fiscal
policy cannot have the desired impact on the economic development. Direct taxation
at times become an instrument of limited applicability, as the vast majority of the
people are not covered by it. Further, when the total tax revenue forms a smaller
portion of the national income, fiscal measures will not step up the sagging economy
requiring massive help.
198
2. Fiscal policy as ineffective anti-cyclical measure
Fiscal measures- both loosening fiscal policy and tightening fiscal policy- will
not stimulate speedy economic growth of a country, when the different sectors of the
economy are not closely integrated with one another. Action taken by the government
may not always have the same effect on all the sectors. Thus we may have for
instance the recession in some sectors followed by a rise in prices in other sectors.
An increasing purchasing power through deficit financing, a policy advocated by J.M.
Keynes in 1930s may not have the effect of reviving the recession hit economies, but
merely result in a spiralling rise in prices.
3. Administrative delay
Fiscal measures may introduce delay, uncertainties and arbitrariness arising
from administrative bottlenecks. As a result, fiscal policy fails to be a powerful and
therefore a useful stabilization policy.
Other Limitations
Large scale underemployment, lack of coordination from the public, tax
evasion, low tax base are the other limitations of fiscal policy.

Introduction
The term ‘bank’ is derived from the French word ‘Banco’ which
means a Bench or Money exchange table. In olden days, European money
lenders or money changers used to display (show) coins of different
countries in big heaps (quantity) on benches or tables for the purpose of
lending or exchanging.
Banking System – Definitions
Banking systems refer to a structural network of institutions that
provide financial in a country. It deals with the ownership of banks,
the structure of banking system, functions performed and the nature of
business. The elements of the banking system include:
a) 
C ommercial banks
b) 
Investment banks
c) 
C entral bank. The commercial banks accept deposits and lend loans
and advances; the investment banks deal with capital market issues
and trading; and the central bank regulates the banking system
by setting monetary policies besides many other functions like
currency issue.
A banking system also refers a system provided by the bank which
offers cash management services for customers, reporting the transactions
of their accounts and portfolios, throughout the day.

What is a Bank?
Oxford Dictionary defines a bank as “an establishment for custody
of money, which it pays out on customer’s order.”
According to Prof. Sayers, “A bank is an institution whose debts
are widely accepted in settlement of other people’s debts to each other.” In
this definition Sayers has emphasized the transactions from debts which
are raised by a financial institution.
According to the Indian Banking Company Act 1949, “A banking
company means any company which transacts the business of banking.
Banking means accepting for the purpose of lending or investment, of
deposits of money from the public, repayable on demand or other wise
and withdrawable by cheque, draft or otherwise.”This definition throws
light on the three major functions of a bank. They are:
(i) Accepting of deposits and lending loans
(ii) Issue and pay cheques,
(iii) Collect cheques on behalf of the customers.
A bank is a financial institution that provides banking and other
financial services to their customers. A bank is an institution which
provides fundamental banking services such as accepting deposits and
lending loans. As financial intermediaries, banks stand between depositors
who supply capital and borrowers who demand capital. When banks accept
deposits its liabilities increase and it becomes a debtor, but when it makes
advances its assets increases and it becomes a creditor.
Banks are a subset of the financial services industry. The banks
are the main participants of the financial system in India. All the banks
safeguard the money and valuables and provide loans, credit, and payment
services, such as money orders, and cheques. The banks also offer
investment and insurance products.
Due to the emergence of integration among finance industries,
some of the traditional distinctions between banks, insurance companies
and securities firms have diminished and they have converted themselves
into Universal Banks to offer a variety of services under one umbrella.
5Notes
Example: IDBI Bank and ICICI. In spite of these changes, banks continue
to maintain and perform their primary role—accepting deposits and
lending funds from these deposits.
History of Modern Banking in India
Modern Banking in India originated in the last decades of the 18th
century. The first banks were The General Bank of India, which started in
1786, and Bank of Hindustan, which started in 1770; both are now defunct.
The oldest bank still in existence in India is the State Bank of India, which
originated in the Bank of Calcutta in June 1806, which almost immediately
became the Bank of Bengal. This was one of the three presidency banks,
the other two being the Bank of Bombay and the Bank of Madras, all
three of which were established under charters from the British East India
Company. For many years the presidency banks acted as quasi-central
banks, as did their successors. The three banks merged in 1921 to form
the Imperial Bank of India, which, upon India’s independence, became the
State Bank of India in 1955.
In April 1935, the Reserve Bank of India was established. At the time
of first phase the progress of banking sector was very sluggish. Between
1913 and1948 there were around 1100 small banks in India. To reform
the working and activities of commercial banks, the Government of India
came up with the Banking Companies Act, 1949 which was later changed
to Banking Regulation Act 1949 as per amending Act of 1965 (Act No.23
of 1965). Reserve Bank of India was vested with extensive powers for the
supervision of banking in India as a Central Banking Authority.
After independence, Government has taken most important steps
in regard of Indian Banking Sector reforms. In 1955, the Imperial Bank of
India was nationalized and was given the name “State Bank of India”, to act
as the principal agent of RBI and to handle banking transactions all over
the country. It was established under State Bank of India Act, 1955. Seven
banks forming subsidiary of State Bank of India was nationalized in1960.
According to the Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer
of Undertakings) Bill, 1969, the objective and reasons for bank
nationalization are: “The banking system touches the lives of millions and
has to be inspired by large social purposes and has to sub-serve national
6Notes
priorities and objectives, such as rapid growth in agriculture, small
industries and exports, raising of employment levels, encouragement of
new entrepreneurs and the development of the backward areas. “For this
purpose, it is necessary for the Government to take direct responsibility for
the extension and diversification of banking services and for the working
of the substantial part of the banking system.”
On 19th July, 1969, 14 major Indian commercial banks of the
country were nationalized. In 1980, another six banks were nationalized,
and thus raising the number of nationalized banks to20. Seven more banks
were nationalized with deposits over 200 Crores. Later on, in the year
1993, the government merged New Bank of India with Punjab National
Bank. It was the only merger between nationalized banks and resulted in
the reduction of the number of nationalized banks from 20 to 19. Till the
year1980 approximately 80% of the banking segment in India was under
government’s ownership. On the suggestions of Narsimhan Committee,
the Banking Regulation Act was amended in 1993 and hence, the gateways
for the new private sector banks were opened.
The following are the major steps taken by the Government of
India to Regulate Banking institutions in the country:-
➢ ➢ 
1949: Enactment of Banking Regulation Act.
➢ ➢ 
1955:Nationalization of State Bank of India.
➢ ➢ 
1959: Nationalization of SBI subsidiaries.
➢ ➢ 
1961: Insurance cover extended to deposits.
➢ ➢ 
1969:Nationalisation of 14 major Banks.
➢ ➢ 
1971: Creation of Credit Guarantee Corporation.
➢ ➢ 
1975: Creation of Regional Rural Banks.
➢ ➢ 
1980:Nationalisation of seven banks with deposits over 200 Crores.
In the early 1990s, the then Narsimha Rao government embarked
on a policy of liberalisation, licensing a small number of private banks.
These came to be known as New Generation tech-savvy banks, and
included Global Trust Bank (the first of such new generation banks to be
set up), which later amalgamated with Oriental Bank of Commerce, Axis
Bank(earlier as UTI Bank), ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank.

Figure showing the Functions of Bank
The functions of commercial banks can be broadly categorized into
a) Primary functions
b) Secondary functions.
Primary Functions
Following are the primary functions rendered by banks.
Accepting of Deposits
The primary function of commercial banks is to accept money from
the people in the form of deposits which are usually repayable on demand
or after the expiry of a fixed period. For these deposits, the banks pay a
rate of interest, which is called as interest expenditure. Thus, banks act
as a custodian of depositors’ funds. The deposits may be of various types
such as savings deposits, current deposits, fixed deposits and recurring
deposits.
Savings deposits encourage customers to save money and promote
banking habit among the public. Savings Bank accounts provide a low rate
of interest and they have restrictions on the number of withdrawals by the
8Notes
customers. The SB accounts can be opened in single or joint names. People
who prefer these savings bank accounts include salary and wage earners.
Now, all the banks allow customers to open a savings bank account with
nil balance.
Current Deposit accounts are opened by business people. These
accounts have no restrictions on the number of withdrawals and are
subject to service changes. There is no interest payment but current
account holders can also avail the benefits such as overdraft and cash
credit facilities.
Fixed deposits accounts can be opened by any person who wants
to deposit a lump sum funds at one time for a specific time period. These
accounts provide higher rate of interest depending on the time period for
which it is deposited. These accounts do not allow withdrawal before the
expiry of the period.
Recurring deposit accounts are normally opened and operated by
persons who get regular income such as salary class and petty shop owners.
A specific amount of money is deposited periodically, say, monthly for a
specific period, say, one year. These accounts provide higher rate of interest
and do not allow withdrawal before the expiry of the period.
Lending Loans and Advances
The second primary function of commerce bank is to lend loans
and advances to the corporate sector and households. Normally, the rate of
interest levied on these loans and advances is higher than what it pays on
deposits. The interest income is the major source of income for commercial
banks. The difference in the interest rates (Interest Received and Interest
Paid) is called Interest Spread, which contributes to its profitability. Apart
from leading, the banks usually keep some portion of funds to meet the
demands of depositors and running expenses. The various types of loans
and advances include overdraft, cash credit, loans, discounting of bills of
exchange.
Over Draft (OD) is a facility extended by banks to the current
account holders who maintain their accounts for business purposes. In
this facility, the current account holders can withdraw more money from
9Notes
their accounts than what they maintain as balance. Under this facility,
banks honour the cheques drawn by the customers of the current account
even if sufficient money is not available in their account. This overdrawing
limit will be fixed by the banks for a certain period, based on the credit
quality of the current account holders and their history of dealing with the
bank. The amount overdrawn will be considered as loan and interest will
be charged on the actual amount withdrawn.
Cash Credit (CC) is a facility extended by banks to current
account holders and other who do not have account. In this facility, banks
sanction a credit limit to a borrower for a certain period (usually for a
longer period than overdraft) after verifying the credit worthiness, history
of bank dealings and the track record of business. Normally banks expect
security of tangible assets (such as stock of inventory) and/or guarantees
for sanction cash credit facility. Interest will be charged on the portion
of amount withdrawn from the cash credit account but not on the entire
amount sanctioned to the borrower.
Loans are normally sanctioned for a short term period (say one
year) or medium term (say three to five years). At present, banks lend long
term loans also. Repayment of loan will be made in various installments
(say monthly, quarterly, semiannually, annually) over a specific period of
time or in a lump sum. Banks charge interest on the actual amount of loan
sanctioned and rate of interest is somewhat lower than what is charged
on OD or CC facility. Regarding the collateral (security), banks expect
some tangible assets (like stock of raw materials, finished goods) from the
borrower. There are various types of loans such as secured loans, mortgage
loans, educational loans, personal loans, etc.
Examples for secured loans include two wheeler loans to the
individuals, working capital loans to the business firms, etc. Mortgage
loans are given to the borrowers to purchase immovable tangible assets
such as land, buildings, homes, etc. with a lien/charge on the asset which
will serve as collateral. At present, majority of the banks are granting
home loans to the customers. Educational loans for higher studies and
professional courses are given by banks to the students at a reasonable
rate of interest. Personal Loans (Consumer finance) for individuals are
provided on easy terms and conditions to buy consumer durables like TV,
refrigerators, etc.
10Notes
Discounting of Bill of Exchange is another method of granting
advances to the traders. The banks can advance funds by purchasing or
discounting the bills from traders which arise from trade. Trade bills are
those bills which emerge due to credit sale to customers. If the traders
require money before the expiry of the bills, they can discount the bills with
the banks. The banker will pay an amount to the drawer or beneficiary of
the bill (usually trader who sold goods on credit basis to customers) after
deducting the discount amount. On maturity of the bill, the banker will
receive the amount from the drawee or acceptor of the bill (the customer
who bought goods on credit terms).
Secondary Functions
Following are the secondary functions performed by the banks
Besides the primary functions of accepting deposits and lending
loans and advances, banks perform various other functions, which are
called secondary functions. They include agency functions and utility
functions.
Agency Functions
The banks act as agent of their customers and perform a number
of agency functions which include transfer of funds, collection of cheques,
periodic payment, periodic collections, portfolio management and other
agency functions.
Transfer of Funds is made by banks from one branch to another or
from one place to another for customers. At present, banks use technology
and telecommunication systems to facilitate these transfers. Example:
Electronic fund transfers (EFT). For this service, banks collect service
charges.
Collection of Cheques is facilitated by banks through clearing
section. Thus, the cheques deposited or presented for collection are
credited to the customers’ account once they collect the same through
clearing process. This includes the cheques of the same bank or other
banks and within the station and outstation. For providing this service,
they charge collection charges which are very nominal.
11Notes
Periodic Payments such as payment of public utility bills, rent,
interest, etc. are made by banks on behalf of the customers based on
their standing instructions. A specific example: Payment of housing loan
interest from salary account.
Periodic Collections such as receipt of salary, pension, dividend,
interest, rent, etc. are made by banks on behalf of the customers based on
their standing instructions. A specific example: Receipt of dividend from
investments.
Portfolio Management services are offered by banks to guide
the customers or clients on their investment decisions to buy or sell the
securities (shares and debentures) to achieve optimal portfolio for getting
maximum returns.
Other Agency Functions like acting as trustee, administrator,
adviser, executor, etc. on behalf of the customer or client are provided by
banks.
General Utility Functions/Financial Services
The banks performs general utility functions such as issue of drafts,
letter of credits, locker facility, underwriting of shares, dealing in foreign
exchange, project counseling, social responsibility programmes and other
utility functions.
Issue of Drafts, Traveller Cheques and Letter of Credits are done
by banks for facilitating the transfer of money from one place to another
and for giving guarantee for import trade. Travellers’cheques is also issued
by banks.
Safety Locker Facility is provided to customers for safe keeping
their valuables such as documents, gold, silver articles and other values.
Underwriting of Shares and debentures are done by banks in
the capacity of merchant banker through their subsidiaries. In the case
of client’s capital issue fails in the market, the banks assume the risk of
under subscription by underwriting the issue. For this, banks receive
underwriting commission.
12Notes
Dealing in Foreign Exchange can be undertaken by banks as they
are allowed by RBI. They will act as deal makers or traders depending on
their position.
Project Reports are being prepared on behalf of the clients or
customers. Many corporate which take up projects and look for financial
assistance have to prepare project reports for submitting the same to the
Financial Institutions or Banks. This project report preparation requires
expertise personnel which the banks possess. Banks collect consultancy
charges from their clients or customers.
Social Responsibility Programmes such as public welfare
campaigns, adult literacy programmes, maintenance of schools, parts,
blood donation camps, etc. are undertaken by banks to showcase their
social responsibility.
Other Utility Functions may include any other function the bank
may render for customers. Examples include collecting and supplying
business information, acting as a referee to a financial standing of
customers, etc.
Types of Banks
Banks can be classified into various types based on some criteria
like organizational setup, ownership, functions performed by them. The
factors which affected the classification include
a) The regulatory set up prevailing in a country
b) The impact of LPG (Liberalization, Globalization Privatization)
process
c) The need for various financial services among the customers. With
the changing perspectives of trade and commerce, banking and
financial system in India has undergone tremendous changes in the
recent past. In this section, we will learn as how to classify the banks
based on various criteria such as organizational set up, ownership
and functions performed by banks.

Let us now discuss the meaning of each one of them.
Based on the Structure or Organizational Setup
Banks can be of five types based on the structure or organizational
setup, viz., unit bank, branch bank, group bank, chain bank and
correspondent bank.
1) Unit Bank is a type of bank under which the banking operations
are carried by a single branch with a single office and they limit
their operations to a limited area. Normally, unit banks may not
have any branch or it may have one or two branches. This unit
banking system has its origin in United State of America (USA) and
14Notes
each unit bank has its own shareholders and board of management.
In USA, each State may have many unit banks but each unit bank
limits its operation within the State or country. There may be many
central banks and they control the unit banks operating in their
States. Collectively the central banks are called Federal Reserve
Banks.
2) Branch Bank is a type of banking system under which the banking
operations are carried with the help of branch network and the
branches are controlled by the Head Office of the bank through their
zonal or regional offices. Each branch of a bank will be managed by
a responsible person called branch manager who will be assisted by
the officers, clerks and sub-staff. In England and India, this type of
branch banking system is in practice. In India, State Bank of India
(SBI) is the biggest public sector bank with a very wide network of
16000 branches.
3) Group Bank is a system of banking under which there will be
holding company controlling the subsidiary companies which
carry out banking business. In some cases, both the holding and
subsidiary companies may carry out banking business. An apt
example in India is SBI which has many subsidiary banks such as
State Bank of Mysore, State Bank of Indore, State Bank of Hyderabad,
State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur, State Bank of Patiala and State
Bank of Travancore. These subsidiaries carry out banking and other
operations such as leasing, merchant banking and so on.
4) Chain Bank is a system under which different banks come under
a common control through common shareholders or by the inter-
locking of directors. An apt example in India is KarurVysya Bank
and Lakshmi Vilas Bank having their head offices located in the
same place, viz., Karur and sharing common directors by which
they may have common management policy.
5) Correspondent Bank is a bank which link two banks of different
stature or size. Many Indian banks act as correspondent banks for
many foreign banks.
15Notes
Based on the Ownership
Banks can be of four types based on the ownership. They are public
sector banks, private sector banks, foreign banks and cooperative banks.
1) Public Sector Banks are those banks in which majority stake
(i.e., more than 50% of the shares) is held by the government of
the country. The words such as “The” or “Ltd” will not be found
in their names because the ownership of these banks are with the
government and the liability is unlimited in nature. Some examples
of public sector banks in India include Andhra Bank, Canara Bank,
Union Bank of India, Allahabad Bank, Punjab National Bank,
Corporation Bank, Indian Bank and so on.
2) Private Sector Banks are those banks which are owned by group of
private shareholders. They elect board of directors which manages
the affairs of the banks. Some examples of private banks in India
include The Lakshmi Vilas Bank Ltd., The Karur Vysya Bank Ltd.,
The City Union Bank Ltd., HDFC Bank, Axis Bank and son.
3) Foreign Banks are those banks which belong to foreign countries
and have their incorporated head office in foreign countries and
branch offices in other countries. The share capital of the foreign
banks will be fully contributed by the foreign investors. Some
examples of foreign banks in Indian include ABM Amro bank,
Standard Chartered Bank, JP Morgan Chase Bank and so on.
4) Cooperative Banks are those banks which are run by following
cooperative principles of service motive. Their main motive is not
profit making but to help the weaker sections of the society. Some
examples of cooperative banks in India include Central Cooperative
Banks, State Cooperative Banks.
Based on the Functions
Banks can be of various types based on the functions they perform.
They include savings banks, commercial banks, industrial banks,
agricultural development banks, land mortgage/development banks,
cooperative banks, exchange banks, indigenous banks, consumer banks,
central banks.
16Notes
1) Saving Banks are established to encourage savings habit among
the people. There are no separate banks called savings banks but
postal department perform the functions of savings bank. People
can save even very small amount in these banks and these banks
discourage withdrawals by limiting the number of withdrawals
during a year. The amount collected from the customers is invested
in securities such as bonds, government securities, etc. The main
objective of these banks is to promote thrift and savings among the
people. People who prefer these banks include salaried people and
low income groups. At present, in India all the commercial banks
act as savings banks besides providing various other services.
2) Commercial Banks are established to help the people who carry
out trade and commerce, i.e., businessmen. They mobilize deposits
from public and lend short-term loans to businessmen in the form
of overdrafts, cash credit, etc for their commercial activities. As the
commercial activities are of paramount importance to economic
development, the commercial banks play a key role in promoting
commercial activities in the country. Normally they do not provide
long-term loans but provide short to medium term loans to traders
for their working capital needs. Apart from lending, they also
provide a host of services such as cheque collection, discounting
bills of exchange, facilitating money transfer, etc. These commercial
banks are subject to Reserve Bank of India’s regulation.
3) Industrial Banks / Investment Banks are those banks which provide
long term loans to industries for the purpose of expansion and
modernization. They raise capital by issue of shares and debentures
and provide long term loans to industries. These banks are also
responsible for the development of backward areas for which they
promote industries in those places. In India, examples for industrial
banks include Industrial Finance Corporation of India (IFCI),
earlier Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India
(ICICI- Now universal bank) and earlier Industrial Development
Bank of India (IDBI-now universal bank). Investment bank is a
financial and banking organization, which provides both financial
as well as advisory banking services to their clients. Besides this,
they also deal with research, marketing and sales of a range of
financial products like commodities, currency, credit, equities etc.
As investment banks, they contribute to share capital and/or take
17Notes
part in capital issue management for promoting the companies by
underwriting their issues and facilitate public to buy those shares.
The industrial activities are promoted by these banks and they also
mobilize long term deposits. In India, Bank of America, JP Morgan
and BNP Paribas are some of the leading investment banks.
4) Agricultural/Land Development Banks are those banks which
are known as Land Mortgage or Agricultural Banks as they provide
finance to agricultural sector. They provide long term loan for
agriculture for the purposes of purchase of new land, purchase of
heavy agricultural machinery such as tractor, repayment of old debt,
conservation of soil and reclamation of loans. In India, Government
of India has guaranteed the debentures issued by agricultural/
land development banks. In Tamil Nadu, we have Tamil Nadu
Cooperative Land Development bank. They follow the principles of
cooperative banks and help the weaker sections. Commercial banks
do not take active part as they view agricultural financing as risky
one and hence, Agricultural Development Banks play a key role in
this activity.
5) Co-operative Banks are those banks which are registered under the
Cooperative Societies Act 1912. These banks collect share capital
from the public and lend to economically weaker sections. They
provide financial assistance to farmers, salaried class, small scale
industries, etc. They can be found in rural and urban areas and the
functions are similar to commercial banks except that they charge
less interest for the loans and advances.
6) Regional Rural Banks are those banks which are established by
the Government under the Regional Rural Banks Act of 1976
with a specific purpose to provide credit and other facilities to the
small and marginal farmers, agricultural labourers, artisans and
small entrepreneurs in rural areas. Each RRB operates within the
specified local areas.
7) Exchange Banks are also called as foreign exchange banks and
they are incorporated outside the country but carry out business
in India. They provide foreign exchange subject to the rules and
regulations of the country in which they are operating. They also
provide finance to exporters and letter of credit/guarantee to
18Notes
importers. They help in remitting of funds from one country to
another country, discount foreign bills, buy and sell gold silver,
promote foreign trade. Examples of exchange bank include Bank of
America, Hong Kong Bank, etc.
8) Indigenous Banks refer to money lenders and Sahukars. The
money lenders using their own funds and deposits mobilized from
public, grant loans to the needy people. They are more popular in
villages and small towns. Usually, they act as traders and bankers
simultaneously. In India, we have well known Indian communities
such as Marwaries, Multani run their indigenous banks.
9) Consumers Banks operate only in advanced countries like USA
and Germany. The primary objective of these banks is to provide
loans to customers to purchase consumer durables like Car, TV,
Washing Machine, Furniture, etc. The consumers repay the loans
in easy installments.
10) Central / Federal / National Bank is a leader of all the banks in a
country. Every county has a central bank. The prime responsibility of
a Central Bank is to regulate the banking system and control mon-
etary policy. These banks are called as banker to the bankers as they
give financial accommodation to commercial banks. They are non-
profit making institutions and they also act as banker to the gov-
ernment, issue currency notes, etc. They maintain foreign exchange
reserves of the country and all the government accounts are main-
tained with them. They help in money circulation in the economy
and provide financial accommodation to the government in case of
necessity through purchase of treasury bills in the money market. In
India, Reserve Bank of India, in USA, Federal Reserve (a group of
central banks), in UK, Bank of England are the central banks.
Conclusion
This lesson explained the meaning of bank, history of banking,
functions of commercial banks and types of banks. A country’s banking
system depends on the regulatory regime and India works under the
constraints that go with social control and public ownership. The banking
system is very important for the development of financial system and in
turn economic system. Banking system in India is very strong and it plays
a key role in developing Indian economy.

Lesson 1.2 - Structure of Indian Banking System
Learning Objectives
➢ ➢ To understand the structure of Indian Banking System
➢ ➢ To briefly describe the role of central bank
➢ ➢ To describe the role of commercial banks
➢ ➢ To describe the role of cooperative and regional rural banks
Introduction
The structure of banking system varies from country to country
depending on the regulatory regime. Nationalization was a structural
change in the functioning of commercial banks which resulted in to the
emergence of public sector banks. Privatization led to the emergence of
private sector banks and globalization facilitated the entry of foreign banks
in India. The banking system in India is significantly different from that
of other Asian nations because of the country’s unique geographic, social,
and economic characteristics. India has a large population and land size,
a diverse culture, and extreme disparities in income, which are marked
among its regions. In this lesson, we will learn the structure of banking
system in India.
Structure of Indian Banking System
The Indian Banking System is regulated by the central bank, viz.,
Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Under the control of RBI, there are scheduled
and non-scheduled banks. Scheduled banks consist of commercial and
cooperative banks. Scheduled commercial banks consist of public, private,
foreign and regional rural banks. Public sector banks consist of SBI and its
associates, nationalized banks and other public sector banks.
Private sector banks consist of old generation and new generation
banks. Scheduled cooperative banks consist of urban and state cooperative
banks. Let us learn the functions of each and every element of Indian
20Notes
banking system. Non-scheduled banks include local area banks. The
following figure exhibits the structure of Indian Banking System.

Reserve Bank of India
Reserve Bank of India is the central bank of India. It was established
in 1934 and started its operations with effect from April 1, 1935. It is
responsible for guiding and regulating the banking system of a country.
It does not deal with the general public. It acts as banker to government,
issues currency, regulates money circulation in the country, keeps the
deposits of commercial banks, and provides financial accommodation to
commercial banks.
It guides the commercial banks and hence, is called as bankers’ bank.
It maintains the government records relating to revenue and expenditure
under various heads. It advises the government on monetary and credit
policies and decides on the interest rates applicable to bank deposits and
loans and advances. We will learn the structure and functions of central
bank in the next unit.
21Notes
Scheduled Banks
Scheduled banks are those banks which are included in the second
Schedule of Reserve Bank of India Act 1934. For this inclusion, the banks
have to comply with the criteria laid down vide Section 42(6) of the RBI
Act. Scheduled banks can be classified into scheduled commercial banks
and scheduled commercial banks. The criteria for scheduled banks include
the following:
(i) Has a paid- up capital and reserves of an aggregate value of not less
than five lakhs of rupees;
(ii) Satisfies the RBI that its affairs are not being conducted in a
manner detrimental to the interest of its depositors,
(iii) Is a State co- operative bank or a company as defined in section 3
of the Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956 ), or an institution notified
by the Central Government in this behalf or a corporation or a
company incorporated by or under any law in force in any place
outside India.
Scheduled banks can be divided into scheduled commercial banks
and scheduled cooperative banks.
a) Scheduled Commercial Banks
Scheduled commercial Banks are those banks which accept
deposits and lend short-term loans and advances to their customers. After
few banks emerged as Universal Banks, they started granting medium
and long-term loans as well. They are the bedrock of the Indian financial
system and account for three fourths of the financial market. They are
present throughout India and their branch network has grown four folds
in the last 40 years. The branch network of commercial banks has crossed
now 1,00,000 branches.
The scheduled commercial banks are classified into the three types,
viz., public sector banks, private sector banks, foreign banks and regional
rural banks.
22Notes
i) Public Sector Banks are those banks in which the majority of the
shareholding is held by the Government of India and they are major
constituent of Indian Banking System. At present as on 31-1-2013,
there are 27 public sector banks functioning in India. They are
categorized into SBI and its 6 associates of SBI, 19 nationalized banks
and IDBI Bank Ltd.
Public sector banks have assumed the lead role in expansion of
branch network all over the country, especially in the rural areas. They
account for 69% of branch network of scheduled commercial banks in
2012. The number of branches has increased from 50179 in 2006 to 70314
in 2012. Their presence in the rural areas is remarkable.
State Bank of India and its associates: In 1951, when the First
Five Year Plan was launched, the development of rural India was given
the highest priority. The commercial banks of the country including the
Imperial Bank of India had till then confined their operations to the
urban sector and were not equipped to respond to the emergent needs of
economic regeneration of the rural areas. In order, therefore, to serve the
economy in general and the rural sector in particular, the All India Rural
Credit Survey Committee recommended the creation of a state-partnered
and state-sponsored bank by taking over the Imperial Bank of India, and
integrating with it, the former state-owned or state-associate banks.
An act was accordingly passed in Parliament in May 1955 and the
State Bank of India was constituted on 1 July 1955. More than a quarter of
the resources of the Indian banking system thus passed under the direct
control of the State. Later, the State Bank of India (Subsidiary Banks) Act
was passed in 1959, enabling the State Bank of India to take over eight
former State-associated banks as its subsidiaries (later named Associates).
The State Bank of India was thus born with a new sense of social
purpose aided by the 480 offices comprising branches, sub offices and
three Local Head Offices inherited from the Imperial Bank. The concept
of banking as mere repositories of the community’s savings and lenders
to creditworthy parties was soon to give way to the concept of purposeful
banking sub serving the growing and diversified financial needs of planned
economic development. The State Bank of India was destined to act as
the pacesetter in this respect and lead the Indian banking system into the
exciting field of national development.
23Notes
As of March 31, 2012, the Bank had a network of 20,193 branches,
including 5,096 branches of its five associate banks. In addition to banking,
the Company, through its various subsidiaries, provides a range of
financial services, which include life insurance, merchant banking, mutual
funds, credit card, factoring, security trading, pension fund management,
custodial services, general insurance (non-life insurance) and primary
dealership in the money market.
Its segments include Treasury, which includes investment portfolio
and trading in foreign exchange contracts and derivative contracts;
Corporate/Wholesale Banking, which comprises lending activities of
Corporate Accounts Group, Mid Corporate Accounts Group and Stressed
Assets Management Group; Retail Banking, which comprises of branches
in National Banking Group, which includes personal banking activities,
including lending activities to corporate customers, and Other Banking
Business. To make SBI a global power house, the Government has plans to
merge SBI associates with SBI in the near future.
Nationalised Banks have contributed a lot for the growth of
economy of India and they dominate the Indian Banking System. The
major objectives of nationalization of commercial banks were to provide
social welfare, control of private monopolies, and expansion of banking,
reduction of regional imbalance, provision of priority sector lending and
creation of banking habits.
They were established with great purpose to make wide reach of
banking activity including rural areas. They are fully committed to offer
the best possible service to the rural community. They are recognized for
their transparency in service and financial reporting. At present, they have
started diversifying their services and cross sell products of other financial
intermediaries. For example, Bancassurance is one such product, in which
a bank will sell the insurance product of an insurance company.
Industrial Development Bank of India Ltd. (IDBI) is today one
of India’s largest commercial Banks. For over 40 years, IDBI Bank has
played a key nation-building role, first as the apex Development Financial
Institution (DFI) (July 1, 1964 to September 30, 2004) in the realm of
industry and thereafter as a full-service commercial Bank (October 1, 2004
onwards). As a DFI, the erstwhile IDBI stretched its canvas beyond mere
24Notes
project financing to cover an array of services that contributed towards
balanced geographical spread of industries, development of identified
backward areas, emergence of a new spirit of enterprise and evolution of a
deep and vibrant capital market.
On October 1, 2004, the erstwhile IDBI converted into a Banking
company (as Industrial Development Bank of India Limited) to undertake
the entire gamut of Banking activities while continuing to play its secular
DFI role. Post the mergers of the erstwhile IDBI Bank with its parent
company (IDBI Ltd.) on April 2, 2005 (appointed date: October 1, 2004)
and the subsequent merger of the erstwhile United Western Bank Ltd. with
IDBI Bank on October 3, 2006, the tech-savvy, new generation Bank with
majority Government shareholding today touches the lives of millions of
Indians through an array of corporate, retail, SME and Agri products and
services. Headquartered in Mumbai, IDBI Bank today rides on the back
of a robust business strategy, a highly competent and dedicated workforce
and a state-of-the-art information technology platform, to structure and
deliver personalized and innovative Banking services and customized
financial solutions to its clients across various delivery channels.
As on March 31, 2012, IDBI Bank has a balance sheet of `2.91
lakh crore and business size (deposits plus advances) of `3.92 lakh crore.
As a Universal Bank, IDBI Bank, besides its core banking and project
finance domain, has an established presence in associated financial
sector businesses like Capital Market, Investment Banking and Mutual
Fund Business. Going forward, IDBI Bank is strongly committed to work
towards emerging as the ‘Bank of choice’ and ‘the most valued financial
conglomerate’, besides generating wealth and value to all its stakeholders.
ii) Private Sector Banks’ are those banks in which the majority of the
shareholding is held by private individuals and corporate.
Old Generation Private Banks
When nationalization of banks took place in two periods, viz., 1969
and 1980, not all the private banks were nationalized. The banks which
were not nationalized remain private banks and they are named as old
generation private sector banks. There are 15 old generation private banks
operating in India.
25Notes
New Generation Private Banks
With the introduction of new economic policies in 1991, the Reserve
Bank of India issued guidelines in 1993 and 2001 to give licences to new
private banks with a capital introduction of ` 300 crore. 10 banks were
set up after 1993 and another 2 after the 2001 guidelines. Of these 12 new
private banks, four were promoted by development financial institutions,
one each by conversion of a co-operative bank and an NBFC (non-
banking financial institutions) into commercial banks, five by banking
professionals, and one by a media house. However, due to various reasons
including lack of financial strength and bad governance, a lot of mergers
took place and presently there are only 7 new private banks operating
in India. The branch network of private sector banks (both new and old
generation banks) has increased from 6834 in 2006 to 13868 in 2012.
The role of private sector banks in Indian economy is commendable
and they provide high degree of professional management, create health
competition, encourage foreign investment, help to access foreign capital
markets and help to develop innovation and achieve expertise. They used
technology and led the other banks in various new business lines such
as credit card, ATM and computerized operations. Undoubtedly, being
tech-savvy and full of expertise, private banks have played a major role
in the development of Indian banking industry. They have made banking
more efficient and customer friendly. In the process, they have shaken
public sector banks out of complacency and compelled them to become
more competitive. Now, the RBI wants to liberalize its licensing policy to
allow industrial and business houses to float their own banks. The latest
Banking Bill envisaged to increase the cap on voting rights for investors in
private sector lenders to 26 per cent from 10 per cent and in public sector
banks (PSU) banks, the cap on voting rights has been raised to 10 per cent
from 1 per cent.
iii) Foreign Banks are those banks which have their registered and
incorporated head office in a foreign country but have their branch
offices operating in India. RBI permits the foreign banks to operate
either through their branches or wholly owned subsidiaries. Corporate
segment has been the main business line of most of the foreign banks
operating in India. In the recent years, some of the foreign banks have
started providing consumer financing such as home loans, automobile
26Notes
finance, credit cards, household consumer finance. They are subject
to all RBI regulations, including priority sector lending norms, which
are applicable to domestic banks. The latest bill on banking will allow
foreign banks to convert their Indian operations into local subsidiaries
or transfer shareholding to a holding company of the bank without
paying stamp duty. At present, foreign banks operate through their
representative offices and branches in India.
iv) Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) are those banks which were established
in 1975 under the provisions of the Ordinance promulgated on the
26th September 1975 and the Regional Rural Banks Act, 1976 with
a view to develop the rural economy and to create a supplementary
channel to the ‘Cooperative Credit Structure’ with a view to enlarge
institutional credit for the rural and agriculture sector. The share
capital of RRB is contributed by the Government of India, the
concerned State Government and the sponsoring public sector banks
in the ration of 50%, 15% and 35% respectively. The area of operation
of the RRBs is limited to notified few districts in a State. The RRBs
mobilize deposits primarily from rural/semi-urban areas and provide
loans and advances mostly to small and marginal farmers, agricultural
labourers, rural artisans and other segments of priority sector. The
Government of India initiated a process of structural consolidation
of RRBs by amalgamating RRBs sponsored by the same bank within a
State, with a view to provide better customer service by having better
infrastructure, computerization, experienced work force, common
publicity and marketing efforts etc. The amalgamated RRBs also
benefit from larger area of operation, enhanced credit exposure limits
for high value and diverse banking activities.
RRBs were also permitted to decide the need for conversion of the
existing loss making branches into satellite / mobile offices keeping in
view the cost-benefit aspect, the likely inconvenience that may be caused
to the existing clientele, the effect of the conversion on the performance
in the preparation of district credit plan and priority sector lending. With
a view to providing better customer service in rural areas, RRBs may also
convert their satellite offices into full-fledged branches after obtaining
concurrence from their board and necessary licence from the concerned
Regional Office of RBI. As a result of the amalgamation, the number of the
RRBs has been reduced from 196 to 82 as on 31 March 2011. The number
of branches of RRBs increased to 16698 in 2012.
27Notes
b) Scheduled Cooperative Banks
Scheduled Cooperative Banks are those banks in which individuals
that have common interest of carrying out banking business by following
the principles of cooperation form a cooperative society under the
Cooperative Societies Act. However, the RBI’s permission has to be obtained
before starting the banking business by the cooperative society. The
cooperative banks function under the overall supervision of the Registrar
and Cooperative Societies of the State, besides following the guidelines
issued by the RBI for banking business. They cater to the financial needs
of agriculture, small industry, retail, and trade, self-employed traders in
urban, semi-urban and rural areas. They are heterogeneous in nature and
their structures differ across urban and rural areas, across states and loan
tenures. Due to their widespread geographical penetration, they have the
prospect to become an important tool for large scale financial inclusion
provided their financial stability is taken care of. RBI and National Bank
for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) have taken a lot of
reform measures to improve the financial soundness of the cooperative
banks. They form the oldest segment of the Indian Banking System. The
cooperative banks can be scheduled or non-scheduled. At present, there
are 1564 non-scheduled urban cooperative banks operating in India. The
scheduled cooperative banks can further be classified in to two types, viz.,
urban cooperative banks and State Cooperative Banks.
i) Urban Co-operative Banks are federation of primary cooperative
societies (which are at village or town level) in a particular area.
These banks function at the district level. When the memberships
of central cooperative banks are restricted to primary cooperative
societies, it is called as “banking union”. At present, individuals are
also permitted to become members of district or central cooperative
banks. These banks provide loans to their members (i.e., primary
credit societies) and function as a link between the primary credit
societies and state co-operative banks. They have on their boards of
management, individuals who have business capacity and influence
besides being a representative of primary societies. They can borrow
money from NABARD for their operations. The source of funds for
these banks includes share capital, reserves, deposits, loans from
State Cooperative Banks or other banks. At present, there are 51
urban scheduled cooperative banks operating in India.
28Notes
ii) State Co-operative Banks are the apex (highest level) co-operative
banks in all the States of India. They attract deposits from the
rich urban classes and channelize among various sectors. Their
constitution differs from one bank to the other. Nevertheless,
usually, the membership includes the representatives from central
cooperative banks and individual shareholders. They provide
rediscounting facilities, collect and disseminate useful information
regarding cooperative movement. At present 31 state cooperative
banks are operating in India.
Non-Scheduled Banks
Non-scheduled bank in India” means a banking company as
defined in clause (c) of section 5 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (10
of 1949), which is not a scheduled bank”. They are not included in the
list of scheduled banks. They function as Local Area Banks. They have to
adhere to the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) condition but are not compelled
to deposit these funds with the RBI. They are set up under the scheme
announced by the government of India in 1996, for the establishment of
new private banks of a local nature; with jurisdiction over a maximum
of three contiguous districts. Six LABs were originally licensed, but the
license of one of them was cancelled due to irregularities in operations, and
the other was amalgamated with Bank of Baroda in 2004 due to its weak
financial position. As at end-March 2009 there were only 4 LABs operating
in India. They get financial assistance from RBI only under emergency
conditions and not for daily operations. They help in the mobilization of
funds from rural and semi urban districts. At present, there are no non-
scheduled banks exist.
Conclusion
This chapter explained as how the structure of Indian Banking
industry is fragmented. To become competitive in the global market, the
structure of the Indian banking industry is to be consolidated and the
Government of India is taking measures by consolidating few public sector
banks into a global power house and by infusing the required capital.

Lesson 1.3 - Banker and Customer Relationship
Learning Objectives
➢ ➢ To define “Banker” and “Customer”
➢ ➢ To understand the various kinds of relationship between banker
and customer.
➢ ➢ To understand the duties of a banker.
Introduction
Depending on the activities, products or services provided by the
bank to its customers or availed by the customer, the relationship between
a banker and a customer emerges. There exist a transactional relationship
between a banker and customer. To understand the relationship between
them, we must understand the terms, “banker” and “customer” clearly.
Definition of a ‘Banker’
According to Banking Regulations Act, 1949, Section 5(b), Banking
is defined as “accepting for the purpose of lending or investments of
deposits of money received from the public and repayable on demand and
withdrawable by cheque, draft, order or otherwise”. Thus, the term banker
is not defined by B R Act but it defines the term “Banking”. This definition
highlights two points:
(1) The primary function of a banker is accepting of deposits for the
purpose of lending or investing the same;
(2) The amount deposited is repayable to the depositor on demand
or according to the agreement. The demand for repayment can
be made through a cheque, draft or otherwise, and not merely by
verbal order. Let us see some definitions of Banker.
30Notes
According to Dr. Herbert L. Heart, “A Banker is one who in the
ordinary course of business honours cheques drawn upon him by any
persons from and for whom he receives money on current accounts”.
According to Sec. 3 of the Indian Negotiable Instruments Act 1881,
the word “banker includes any person acting as banker and any post office
savings bank”.
According to Sec. 2 of the Bill of Exchange Act, 1882, ‘banker
includes a body of persons, whether incorporated or not who carry on the
business of banking.’
From the above definitions, we can derive the meaning of banker
as one who
a) Accepts deposits from public
b) Grants loans and advances
c) Issue and pay cheques
d) Collect cheques for his customers
The word ‘public’ implies that the banker accepts deposits from
anyone who offers money for deposit purpose. For the purpose of
receiving deposit, the customer has to open an account with the bank. For
both depositing and borrowing funds, customer has to have an account
relationship with the bank. The RBI has stipulated “Know Your Customer
(KYC) Norms” for opening bank account and the bankers are strictly
following the same. Hence, if a customer is not transparent, the banker
has the right to rejects his/her application.
Definition of a ‘Customer’
The term ‘Customer’ is not defined by any act either in India or in
English Statutes. The word ‘customer’ has its origin from the word ‘custom’,
which means a ‘habit or tendency’ to-do certain things in a regular or
a particular manner. Generally speaking, a customer is one who has an
account with the bank or who utilizes the services of the bank.
Account relationship is a contractual relationship. It is generally
believed that any individual or an organization, which conducts banking
31Notes
transactions with a bank, is the customer of bank. However, there are many
persons who do utilize services of banks, but do not maintain any account
with the bank. Therefore, bank customers can be conveniently classified
into four types. They are
a) Existing customers
b) Former customers
c) Customers for services like Demand Draft purchase, cheque
encashment, etc.
d) Potential customers
In the past, the customers have to deposit some amount as initial
deposit to open a bank account. Later, as per the directions of RBI, “No
Frill” accounts were allowed by the banks without any deposit, ie., with
nil balance or with meager balance. Now, all the banks are instructed by
RBI to open as many bank accounts as possible without any balance, to
channelize the benefits of government schemes to the public through
Aadhar Card.
In the past, customers can have his transactions only with
the branch with which they maintain their account. But, after the
implementation of Core Banking Solution (Computerization of branches
with interconnectivity), customers can operate their accounts from any
branch of the bank and from anywhere. Thus, earlier system of “customer
to a branch” is converted into “customer to a bank”. However, for any
specific claim or action, the customers have to approach the branch with
which they maintain account.
Classification of Banker-Customer Relationship
The relationship between a banker and customers can be broadly
classified into
a) General Relationship
b) Special Relationship.
As per Sec 5(b) of Banking Regulation Act, the bank’s business is to
accept deposits for the purpose of lending. Thus, the relationship emerging
out of these two main activities is called as General Relationship. As per
32Notes
Sec 6 of Banking Regulation Act, the banker undertakes other activities
on behalf of the customer and provides lot of services to them. Thus, the
relationship emerging out of the provision of these activities and services
is called as Special Relationship.
General Relationship
Under general relationship, the banker and customer may have
two types of relationships, viz., debtor-creditor relationship and creditor-
debtor relationship.
i) Debtor-Creditor Relationship: While opening a bank account,
customers fill and sign the account opening form to enter into
an agreement/contract with the banker. When the customers
deposit money in their account, the relationship between banker
and customer becomes that of debtor and creditor. The amount
deposited becomes the banks’ liability towards the customer and
hence, he becomes debtor to the depositor (Customers). The
banker can use that amount for any purpose, of course, with the
information as to the use of money to the depositors. Normally,
banks do not give any security to the depositors. However, when it
is demanded by the deposits, the banks have to pay (Joachimson vs.
Swiss Bank Corporation). Thus, the banker is completely different
from normal debtors who voluntarily repay the debts. The rate of
interest on the loan is normally decided by the creditor but in the
banker-customer relationship the interest is decided by the banker
who as a debtor pays interest once in six months on the deposits.
The banks need to pay the deposit amount to the depositors when
the demand is made in the proper manner during working days and
working hours. But, nowadays, Any Time Machines (Automatic
Teller Machines) are used to pay the money. The customers get
passbook which carries the account details and all the terms and
conditions. Now, websites of the banks are used for transaction
purposes also and customers can open their accounts online. When
issuing demand draft, telegraphic transfer, bankers become debtors
as they own money of the payee or beneficiary.
ii) Creditor–Debtor: When banks grant loans and advances to the
customers, the relationship between banker and customer is that of
33Notes
creditor-debtor relationship. Customers borrow money from bank
by executing a contract with terms and conditions and by offering
collateral (security). The customers (as debtors) are obliged to repay
the loans and advances as per the terms of the contract.
Special Relationship
In addition to opening of a deposit/loan account banks provide
variety of services, which makes the relationship more wide and complex.
Depending upon the type of services rendered and the nature of transaction,
the banker acts as a bailee, trustee, principal, agent, lessor, custodian etc.
i) Banker as a Trustee: As per Sec. 3 of Indian Trust Act, 1882 ‘ A
“trust” is an obligation annexed to the ownership of property, and
arising out of a confidence reposed in and accepted by the owner,
or declared and accepted by him, for the benefit of another, or of
another and the owner.’ Thus trustee is the holder of property on
behalf of a beneficiary. As per Sec. 15 of the ‘Indian Trust Act, 1882
‘A trustee is bound to deal with the trust-property as carefully as a
man of ordinary prudence would deal with such property if it were
his own; and, in the absence of a contract to the contrary, a trustee so
dealing is not responsible for the loss, destruction or deterioration
of the trust-property.’ A trustee has the right to reimbursement of
expenses (Sec.32 of Indian Trust Act.). In case of trust, banker-
customer relationship is a special contract. When a customer
entrusts valuable items with bank with an intention that such items
would be returned on demand to the customer, the relationship
becomes of a trustee and trustier. Customers keep certain valuables
or securities with the bank for safekeeping or deposit certain money
for a specific purpose (Escrow accounts) the banker in such cases
acts as a trustee. Banks charge fee for safekeeping valuables.
ii) Banker as a Bailee: Sec.148 of Indian Contract Act, 1872, defines
“Bailment” “bailor” and “bailee”. A “bailment” is the delivery of
goods by one person to another for some purpose, upon a contract
that they shall, when the purpose is accomplished, be returned or
otherwise disposed of according to the directions of the person
delivering them. The person delivering the goods is called the
“bailor”. The person to whom they are delivered is called, the “bailee”.
Banks secure customer advances by obtaining tangible securities.
34Notes
In some cases physical possession of securities goods (Pledge),
valuables, bonds etc., are taken. While taking physical possession of
securities, the relationship between banker and customer becomes
that of bailee and bailor. Banks also keeps articles, valuables,
securities etc., of its customers in Safe Custody and acts as a Bailee.
As a bailee, the bank is required to take care of the goods bailed.
iii) Banker as a Lessor: Sec.105 of ‘Transfer of property Act 1882’
defines lease, Lessor, lessee, premium and rent. As per the section
“A lease of immovable property is a transfer of a right to enjoy
such property, made for a certain time, express or implied, or in
perpetuity, in consideration of a price paid or promised, or of money,
a share of crops, service or any other thing of value, to be rendered
periodically or on specified occasions to the transferor by the
transferee, who accepts the transfer on such terms.” “The transferor
is called the lessor, the transferee is called the lessee, the price is
called the premium, and the money, share, service or other thing
to be so rendered is called the rent.” Providing safe deposit lockers
is as an ancillary service provided by banks to customers. While
providing Safe Deposit Vault/locker facility to their customers,
bank enters into an agreement with the customer. The agreement
is known as “Memorandum of letting” and attracts stamp duty. The
relationship between the bank and the customer is that of lessor
and lessee. Banks lease (let lockers for hire to their customers)
their immovable property to the customer and give them the right
to enjoy such property during the specified period i.e. during the
office/ banking hours and charge rentals. Bank has the right to
break-open the locker in case the locker holder defaults in payment
of rent. Banks do not assume any liability or responsibility in case of
any damage to the contents kept in the locker. Banks do not insure
the contents kept in the lockers by customers.
iv) Banker as an Agent: Sec.182of ‘The Indian Contract Act, 1872’
defines “an agent” as a person employed to do any act for another
or to represent another in dealings with third persons. The person
for whom such act is done or who is so represented is called “the
Principal”. Thus an agent is a person, who acts for and on behalf
of the principal and under the latter’s express or implied authority
and the acts done within such authority are binding on his principal
and, the principal is liable to the party for the acts of the agent.
35Notes
Banks collect cheques, bills, and makes payment to various
authorities, viz., rent, telephone bills, insurance premium etc., on
behalf of customers.. Banks also abides by the standing instructions
given by its customers. In all such cases, bank acts as an agent of
its customer, and charges for these services. As per Indian contract
Act agent is entitled to charges. No charges are levied in collection
of local cheques through clearing house. Charges are levied in only
when the cheque is returned in the clearinghouse.
v) Banker as a Custodian: A custodian is a person who acts as
a caretaker of something. Banks take legal responsibility for a
customer’s securities. While opening a DMAT account bank
becomes a custodian.
vi) Banker as a Guarantor: Banks give guarantee on behalf of their
customers. Guarantee is a contingent contract. As per sec 31, of
Indian contract Act guarantee is a “contingent contract”. Contingent
contract is a contract to do or not to do something, if some event,
collateral to such contract, does or does not happen. It would thus
be observed that banker customer relationship is transactional
relationship.
Legal Relationship between Banker and Customer
Trust is the basic requirement of bank-customer relationship. The
relationship depends on the kind of transaction the customers have with
the bank. It is based on contract with certain terms and conditions. It is
a fiduciary relationship. The distinctive features of the legal relationship
between the banker and the customer may be called as the duties, rights
and liabilities of the banker.
Duties of the Banker
The duties of the banker vis-à-vis customer include the following:
i) Duty to honour cheques: As ‘banking’ means accepting of deposits
withdrawable by cheque, draft, order or otherwise, the banker is
duty bound to honour cheques issued by the customers on their
accounts. Sec. 31of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 specifies
the liability of drawee of cheque. As per Sec. 31 “The drawee of a
36Notes
cheque having sufficient funds of the drawer in his hands properly
applicable to the payment of such cheque must pay the cheque
when duly required so to do, and, in. default of such payment,
must compensate the drawer for any loss or damage caused by such
default.” Thus, it is the duty of a bank to honour the cheques issued
by the account holder if
a) The cheque has been properly drawn and is in order in all
respects i.e. it is properly dated, amount in words and figures
have been expressed properly, is neither state nor post-dated
nor mutilated and the signature of accountholder tallies with
the specimen recorded with the bank.
b) The cheque should be drawn on the branch where the account
is maintained. (Due to implementation of technology and
core banking solution a customer can present cheques on any
branch of a bank. RBI has advised banks to issue multi city
cheques to account holders.)
c) There is sufficient balance in the account and the balance is
properly applicable for payment of the cheque.
d) The cheque is presented for payment on a working day and
during the business hours of the branch.
e) Endorsements on the cheque are regular and proper.
f) The payment of the cheque is not countermanded by the
drawer.
However, the duty of the banker to honour cheques ceases on
receipt of:
a) Stop payment instructions from the account holder.
b) Notice about the death of the drawer.
c) A garnishee order attaching the balance in the account or an
income-tax attachment order received by the banker.
d) Drawer of the cheque becoming insolvent and/or a lunatic at the
time of drawing the cheque.
37Notes
In the following cases, banker can refuse to honour the cheques:
a) There is in sufficient balance in the account to make payment of
the cheque.
b) Cheque issued does not pertain to the account on which it has been
drawn.
c) If the cheque is not in order (post dated, stale, payment counter-
manded, amount in words and figure differs, etc.)
d) The balances held in account are earmarked for some specific
purpose and the remaining balance is not sufficient to honour the
cheque.
ii) Duty to maintain secrecy/confidentiality: It is the duty of the
banker not to disclose the state of customer’s account to anyone else
and maintain secrecy of customers’ accounts. Maintaining secrecy is
not only a moral duty but bank is legally bound to keep the affairs of
the customer secret. The principle behind this duty is that disclosure
about the dealings of the customer to any unauthorized person may
harm the reputation of customer and the bank may be held liable.
The duty of maintaining secrecy does not cease with the closing
of account or on the death of the account holder. As per Sec. 13
of “Banking Companies Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings
Act 1970”- “Every corresponding new bank shall observe, except
as otherwise required by law, the practices and usages customary
among bankers, and, in particular, it shall not divulge any
information relating to or to the affairs of its constituents except in
circumstances in which it is, in accordance with law or practices and
usages customary among bankers, necessary or appropriate for the
corresponding new bank to divulge such information.” Maintaining
secrecy is implied terms of the contract with the customer which
bank enters into with the customer at the time of opening an
account. Bank has not only to maintain secrecy of transactions, but
secrecy is also to be maintained in respect of operations through
ATM/ debit cards. Bank has also to maintain secrecy of user ID pins
with due care so that it does fall in wrong hands.
38Notes
Failure to maintain secrecy makes the bank liable to pay damages
to the account holder for loss of money and reputation if it fails in its duty
to maintain secrecy and discloses information relating to a customer’s
account or conduct of the account to any unauthorized person.
Circumstances under which banker can disclose information of
customer’s account include the following
a) Under compulsion of law: Banks disclose information to various
authorities who by virtue of powers vested in them under provi-
sions of various acts require banks to furnish information about
customer’s account. The information is called under Section 4 of
Banker’s Book Evidence Act, 189; Section 94 (3) of Code of Civil
Procedure Act, 1908; Section 45 (B) of Reserve Bank of India Act,
1934; Section 26 of Banking Regulation Act, 1949; Section 36 of
Gift Tax Act, 1958; Sections 131, 133 of Income Tax Act, 1961; Sec-
tion 29 of Industrial Development Bank of India Act, 1964; Section
12of Foreign Exchange Management Act, (FEMA) 1999; and Sec-
tion 12 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002. Banks
are required to furnish only the called for information (no addi-
tional information is to be furnished) on receipt of written request
of the person who is vested with the authority to call for such infor-
mation under the said acts. The customer is kept informed about
the disclosure of the information.
b) Under banking practices: In order to ascertain financial position
and credit worthiness of the person banks obtain information
from other banks with which they are maintaining accounts. It is
an established practice among bankers and implied consent of the
customer is presumed to exist. The opinion is given in strictest
confidence and without responsibility on the part of the bank
furnishing such information. Credit information is furnished in
coded terms to other banks on IBA format and without signatures.
c) For protecting national interest.
d) For protecting bank’s own interest
e) Under express or implied consent of the customer
39Notes
iii) Duty to provide proper accounts: Banks are under duty bound
to provide proper accounts to the customer of all the transactions
done by him. Bank is required to submit a statement of accounts /
passbook to the customer containing all the credits and debits in
the account.
iv) Duty to carryout standing instructions: Banks have to carry out
the standing instructions given by the customers such as collection
of interest, transfer of funds, etc.
v) Duty to provide proper services: The banks have the duty to provide
proper services and not to release Articles/items of customers kept
with the bank to a third party without due authorization by the
customer. In case banker wants to close the account, reasonable
notification is to be sent to the customer.
Rights of the Banker
The rights of the banker vis-à-vis customer include the following:
Right of Lien: A lien is the right of a creditor in possession of
goods, securities or any other assets belonging to the debtor to retain
them until the debt is repaid, provided that there is no contract express or
implied, to the contrary. It is a right to retain possession of specific goods
or securities or other movables of which the ownership vests in some other
person and the possession can be retained till the owner discharges the
debt or obligation to the possessor. The creditor (bank) has the right to
maintain the security of the debtor but not to sell it. There are two types
of lien viz.,
a) 
Particular Lien
b) 
Right of General Lien
Particular Lien
A ‘particular lien’ gives the right to retain possession only of those
goods in respect of which the dues have arisen. It is also termed as ordinary
lien. If the bank has obtained a particular security for a particular debt,
then the banker’s right gets converted into a particular lien.
40Notes
Right of General Lien
Banker has a right of general lien against his borrower. General lien
confers banks right in respect of all dues and not for a particular due. It is a
statutory right of the bank and is available even in absence of an agreement
but it does not confer the right to pledge. A ‘general lien’ gives the right to
retain possession of any goods in the legal possession of the creditor until
the whole of the debt due from the debtor is paid. Section 171 of Indian
Contract Act, 1872 confers the right of general lien to banks. As per the
section “Bankers, factors, attorneys of a High Court and policy-brokers
may, in the absence of a contract to the contrary, retain, as a security for a
general balance of account any goods bailed to them; but no other persons
have a right to retain, as a security for such balance, goods bailed to them,
unless there is an express contract to the effect.”Bank has a right of lien
only when goods, securities are received in the capacity as a creditor. While
granting advances banks take documents. These documents confer right
to convert general lien as an implied pledge. A banker’s lien is more than
a general lien, it is an implied pledge and he has the right to sell the goods
in case of default Bank has a ‘Right of Sale’ of goods under lien. Banker’s
right of lien is not barred by the Law of Limitation.
Bank has the right of lien on goods and securities entrusted to him
legally and standing in the name of the borrower. Bank can exercise right
of lien on the securities in its possession for the dues of the same borrower,
even after the loan taken against that particular security has been re-paid.
Right of lien can be exercised on bills, cheques, promissory notes, share
certificates, bonds, debentures etc.
Bank cannot exercise right of lien on goods received for safe
custody, goods held in capacity as a trustee, or as an agent of the customer,
or left in bank by mistake.
Right of Set-Off: The banker has the right to set off the accounts of
its customer. It is a statutory right available to a bank, to set off a debt owed
to him by a creditor from the credit balances held in other accounts of the
borrower. The right of set-off can be exercised only if there is no agreement
express or implied to the contrary. This right is applicable in respect of
dues that are due, are becoming due i.e. certain and not contingent. It
is not applicable on future debts. It is applicable in respect of deposits
41Notes
that are due for payment. The right of set off enables bank to combine
all kinds of credit and debit balances of a customer for arriving at a net
sum due. The right is also available for deposits kept in other branches
of the same bank. The right can be exercised after death, insolvency, and
dissolution of a company, after receipt of a garnishee/attachment order.
The right is also available for time barred debts. Deposits held in the name
of a guarantor cannot be set off to the debit balance in borrowers account
until a demand is made to the guarantor and his liability becomes certain.
Banks cannot set off the credit balance of customer’s personal account for
a joint loan account of the customer with another person unless both the
joint accountholders are jointly and severally liable. Banks exercise the
Right of set off only after serving a notice on the customer informing him
that the bank is going to exercise the right of set-off.
Depending on the situation, sometimes the set off takes place
automatically without the permission from the customer. In the following
events the set off happens automatically i.e., without the permission from
the customer:
a) On the death of the customer;
b) On customer becoming insolvent;
c) On receipt of a Garnishee order on customer’s account by court;
d) On receipt of a notice of assignment of credit balance by the
customer to the banker
e) On receipt of notice of second charge on the securities already
charged to the bank.
Following are the conditions to be followed while exercising right
of Set - Off:
a) 
The account should be in the sole name of the customer.
b) 
The amount of debts must be certain and measurable.
c) 
There should not be any agreement to the contrary
d) 
Funds should not be held in trust accounts
e) 
The right cannot be exercised in respect of future or contingent
debts.
f) 
The banker has the right to exercise this right before a garnishee
order is received by it.
42Notes
Right of Appropriation: It is the right of the customers to direct
his banker against which debt (when more than one debit outstanding) the
payment made by him should be appropriated. In case no such direction is
given, the bank can exercise its right of appropriation and apply it in payment
of any debt. Section 59,60 and 61 of Indian Contract Act, 1872 lays down
the rules of appropriation.Sec.59.Application of payment where debt to
be discharged is indicated: (i.e.– As per borrowers instructions)Where
a debtor, owing several distinct debts to one person, makes a payment to
him, either with express intimation, or under circumstances implying that
the payment is to be applied to the discharge of some particular debt, the
payment, if accepted, must be applied accordingly.Sec.60. Application of
payment where debt to be discharged is not indicated: (i.e. in the absence
of express or implied intention of debtor). Sec.60 of the Indian Contract
Act states that if the debtor does not intimate or there is no circumstance
of indicating how the payment is to be used, the right of appropriation is
vested in the creditor.
According to the Act, “Where the debtor has omitted to intimate and
there are no other circumstances, indicating to which debt the payment is
to be applied, the creditor may apply it at his discretion to any lawful debt
actually due and payable to him from the debtor, whether its recovery is or
is not barred by the law in force for the time being as to the limitation of
suits.”Sec.61.Application of payment where neither party appropriates.
Where neither party makes any appropriation the payment shall
be applied in discharge of the debts in order of time, whether they are or
are not barred by the law in force for the time being as to the limitation
of suits. If the debts are of equal standing, the payment shall be applied
in discharge of each proportionally. Unless there is an agreement to the
contrary, any payment made by a debtor is applied first towards interest
and thereafter towards principal. If a customer has only one account and
he deposits and withdraws money from it regularly, the order in which the
credit entry will set off the debit entry is in the chronological order, this is
known as Clayton’s rule.
Rule in Clayton’s case: The rule was laid down in famous
Devayanas Vs. Noble. The rule applies to running accounts like CC/
OD with debit balance. The rule states that each withdrawal in a debit
account is considered as a new loan and each deposit as a repayment in
that chronological order.
43Notes
Right to Charge Interest, Commission, Incidental Charges etc.:
Banker has an implied right to charge for services rendered and sold to a
customer. Bank charges interest on amount advanced, processing charges
for the advance, charges for non-utilization of credit facilities sanctioned,
charges commission, exchange, incidental charges etc. depending on
the terms and conditions of advance banks charge interest at monthly,
quarterly or semiannually or annually. Banks charge customers if the
balance in deposit account falls below the prescribed amount. Usually the
bank informs such charges to the customer by various means.
Right to close the account of undesirable customers: Bankers
have the right to close the accounts of the customer who is found unde-
sirable in maintaining balance in the account and due to which frequent
bouncing or dishonouring of cheques takes place. Due to this, the reputa-
tion of the banker is getting affected. Thus, the banker, after giving due
notification to the customer can close his account. In case of death, insol-
vency, lunacy of customers or dissolution of firms or winding up of com-
panies, the account will be closed by the banker.
Liabilities of the Banker
Bankers cannot be held liable when they disclose the customers’
account with the consent of the customers. But, while disclosing the
account, the banker should do so in a discrete manner without causing
any prejudice to the credit worthiness of the customer. No bankers will
disclosure all the bare facts about the account position of a customer.
When a banker discloses the secrecy of the customer’s account to a third
party and if the third party incurs any loss, he cannot make the banker
liable, if banker
a) Has disclosed bare factors without any intention;
b) That the banker has disclosed the details of customer’s account
unintentionally and without any motive to cause injury to third
party.
However, a banker can be held liable criminally when he
intentionally discloses
a) Wrongful facts about the customer
44Notes
b) To cause damage to third party. If the above facts are proved in
a court of law, the banker will be held liable criminally and will
undergo penalty as well as imprisonment and the third party can
also claim damages from the banker, for the losses suffered by
relying on facts which are untrue.
Nomination Facility
Nomination is expression of wish of a person about transfer of his
assets after his death to a named person. Nomination is not a will but it
serves the purpose of will. In terms of Sections45ZA to 45 ZF of the Banking
Regulation Act, 1949, Banking Companies (Nomination) Rules, 1985 have
been framed. Nomination facility simplifies the procedure for settlement
of claims of deceased depositors and locker holders. In an unfortunate
event of the death of a depositor, nomination enables the bank to make
payment to the nominee of a deceased depositor, of the amount standing
to the credit of the depositor, return the articles left by a deceased person
in the bank’s safe custody to the nominee without asking for succession
certificate or verifying claims of legal heirs. Nomination does not take
away the rights of legal heirs on the estate of the deceased. The nominee
receives the money from the bank as a trustee of the legal heirs. In the case
of a joint deposit account the nominee’s right arises only after the death of
all the depositors. Nomination facility is intended for individuals and sole
proprietary concerns.
Where the nominee is a minor, the depositor making the nomination
appoints any person to receive the amount of deposit in the event of his
death during the minority of the nominee. A person legally empowered
to operate a minor’s account can file a nomination on behalf of the minor.
Nomination can be made in account opening form itself or on a separate
form indicating the name and address of the nominee. The account holders
can change the nomination any time. There can be only one Nominee for a
deposit account whether held singly or jointly. There can be two nominees
for a jointly held locker.
Availability of the Nomination Facility
Nomination facility is available for all types of bank deposits, safe
deposit lockers, and safe custody articles. This is also applicable to deposits
45Notes
having operating instructions “Either or Survivor”.Nomination can be
made in favour of one person only. In case of a joint account, nomination
is to be made by all depositors jointly. Nomination cannot be made in
accounts where deposits are held in a representative capacity, e.g., trust
accounts etc. and in accounts of partnership firms, H.U.F., companies,
associations, clubs, etc. Nomination can be made in favour of a minor.
However while making the nomination, the nominee has to appoint
another person (not a minor), to receive the amount of the deposit on
behalf of the nominee in the event of the death of the depositor during
the minority of the nominee. Date of birth of minor be obtained and
noted. A nomination will continue to be in force even on renewal of term
deposit, unless specifically cancelled or changed. Banks obtain separate
nomination form for each term deposit receipt. A non-resident can be
nominated as a nominee in a resident account. In case of non-resident
nominees, the amount entitled to him from the account(s)/ deposits(s)
of a deceased person will be credited to his NRO account. The amount so
credited cannot be remitted outside India.
Insurance of Bank Deposits
The Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation of
India, a public limited company promoted by Reserve Bank of India,
insure bank deposits. The authorized capital of the Corporation is `50
crore, which is fully issued and subscribed by the Reserve Bank of India
(RBI). The management of the Corporation vests in a Board of Directors
of which a Deputy Governor, Reserve bank of India, is the Chairman. The
Corporation protects the interest of depositors and infuses confidence by
providing deposit insurance on account of failure of banks. All commercial
banks including the branches of foreign banks functioning in India, local
area banks, regional rural banks, and all eligible co-operative banks are
covered under the Deposit Insurance Scheme. The insurance covers the
loss of all or part of their deposits in all branches of a bank to a maximum
of `1,00,000.
It insures all deposits such as savings, fixed, current, recurring,
etc except the following types of deposits such as Deposits of foreign
Governments, Deposits of Central/State Governments, Inter-bank
deposits, Deposits of the State Land Development Banks with the State
46Notes
co-operative bank, any amount due on account of and deposit received
outside India, and any amount, which has been specifically exempted by
the corporation with the previous approval of Reserve Bank of India. The
Corporation charges insurance premium from banks on deposits @10 paisa
per `100ofassessable deposits per annum. The premium is charged twice
a year on the assessable deposits as at 31st March and 30th September.
Though the premium is charged on the full amount of deposit kept by
depositors in a bank is insured up to a maximum of `1,00,000 (Rupees
One Lakh) only for both principal and interest amount.
The corporation pays to each depositor through the liquidator, the
amount of his deposit up to Rupees one lakh within two months from the
date of receipt of claim list from the liquidator. If a bank is reconstructed
or amalgamated / merged with another bank, it pays the bank concerned,
the difference between the full amount of deposit or the limit of insurance
cover in force at the time, whichever is less and the amount received by him
under the reconstruction / amalgamation scheme within two months from
the date of receipt of claim list from the transferee bank / Chief Executive
Officer of the insured bank/transferee bank as the case may be.
In the second report of Narasimham Committee (April 1998)
on “Banking Sector Reforms” recommendations have been made for
reforming scheme of Deposit insurance. The committee has recommended
that instead of “flat’” rate premium, it should be ‘risk based’ or ‘variable
rate’ premium.
Know Your Customer (KYC) Norms
As per ‘Know Your Customer’ guidelines issued by Reserve Bank of
India, customer has been defined as:
a) A person or entity that maintains an account and/or has a business
relationship with the bank;
b) One on whose behalf the account is maintained (i.e. the beneficial
owner);
c) Beneficiaries of transactions conducted by professional intermedi-
aries, such as Stock Brokers, Chartered Accountants, Solicitors etc.
as permitted under the law, and
47Notes
d) Any person or entity connected with a financial transaction, which
can pose significant reputational or other risks to the bank, say,
a wire transfer or issue of a high value demand draft as a single
transaction.
KYC Norms and Cash Transactions
The objective of KYC guidelines is to prevent banks from being
used, intentionally or unintentionally, by criminal elements for money
laundering activities. KYC procedures enable banks to know/understand
their customers and their financial dealings better, which in turn help
them, manage their risks prudently. Necessary checks before opening a
new account ensures that the identity of the customer does not match with
any person with known criminal background or with banned entities such
as individual terrorists or terrorist organizations etc. and that no account
is opened in anonymous or fictitious/ benami name(s).
Banks are supposed to adopt due diligence and appropriate KYC
norms at the time of opening of accounts. The objectives of the KYC are to
ensure appropriate customer identification and to monitor transactions of
a suspicious nature. While opening an account a bank is supposed to obtain
all information necessary for establishing the identity/legal existence of
each new customer by taking and verifying the introductory reference from
an existing account holder/a person known to the bank or on the basis of
documents provided by the customer. The means of establishing identity
can be passport, driving license etc. In respect of existing customers banks
are required to complete customer identification at the earliest.
Ceiling and Monitoring of Cash Transactions
As per RBI guidelines issued under Section 35 (A) of the Banking
Regulation Act, 1949:
i) Banks are required to issue travelers cheques, demand drafts, mail
transfers, and telegraphic transfers for `50, 000 and above only by
debit to customers’ accounts or against cheques and not against cash.
While purchasing travelers cheques, demand drafts, mail transfers,
and telegraphic transfers for `50,000 and above purchaser has to
mention his Permanent Income Tax Account Number (PAN) on
the application.
48Notes
ii) The banks are required to keep a close watch of cash withdrawals
and deposits for `10 lakhs and above in deposit, cash credit or
overdraft accounts and keep record of details of these large cash
transactions in a separate register. Branches of banks are required
to report all cash deposits and withdrawals of `10 lakhs and above
as well as transactions of suspicious nature with full details in
fortnightly statements to their controlling offices.
Bankers’ Fair Practice Code
Indian Banks’ Association has prepared a code, which sets standards
of fair banking practices. This document is a broad framework under
which the rights of common depositors are recognized. It is a voluntary
Code that promotes competition and encourages market forces to achieve
higher operating standards for the benefit of customers. The Code applies
to current, savings and all other deposit accounts, collection and remittance
services offered by the banks, loans and overdrafts, foreign-exchange
services, card products and third party products offered by banks.
Termination of Relationship Between a Banker and a Customer
The relationship between a bank and a customer ceases on:
a) The death, insolvency, lunacy of the customer.
b) The customer closing the account i.e. Voluntary termination.
c) Liquidation of the company.
d) The closing of the account by the bank after giving due notice.
e) The completion of the contract or the specific transaction.
Conclusion
The relationship developed between a banker and customer
involves some duties on the part of both. Bank’s business depends much
on the strong bondage with the customer. “Trust” plays an important role
in building healthy relationship between a banker and customer.

Lesson 1.4 - Deposits, Loans & Advances and Assets & Liabilities
Management of Banks
Learning Objectives
➢ ➢ To understand the various types of deposits and loans & advances.
➢ ➢ To understand the balance sheet of a bank.
➢ ➢ To understand the management of assets and liabilities of banks
Introduction
Financial intermediation by commercial banks has played a key role
in India in supporting the economic growth process. An efficient financial
intermediation process has two components: effective mobilization of
savings and their allocation to the most productive uses. In this lesson,
let us discuss both the aspects besides knowing the balance sheet of a
commercial bank and bank’s financial management, viz., assets liabilities
management (ALM).
Deposit Mobilization
When banks mobilize savings, they do it in the form of deposits,
which are the money accepted by banks from customers to be held under
stipulated terms and conditions. Deposits are thus an instrument of
savings. Since the first episode of bank nationalization in 1969, banks have
been at the core of the financial intermediation process in India. They
have mobilized a sizeable share of savings of the household sector, the
major surplus sector of the economy.
This in turn has raised the financial savings of the household sector
and hence the overall savings rate. Notwithstanding the liberalization of
the financial sector and increased competition from various other saving
instruments, bank deposits continue to be the dominant instrument of
savings in India. The gross domestic savings of the Indian economy have
been growing over the years and the household sector has been the most
significant contributor to savings. Household sector saves in two major
50Notes
ways, viz. financial assets and physical assets. Within the financial savings
of the household sector, bank deposits are the most prominent instrument,
accounting for nearly half of total financial savings of the household sector.
Bank Deposits
One of the most important functions of any commercial bank is
to accept deposits from the public, basically for the purpose of lending.
Deposits from the public are the principal sources of funds for banks and
the public sector banks continue to dominate the Indian banking industry.
However, the share of the new private sector banks has been raising at the
expense of the public sector banks, particularly in the last few years.
Safety of Bank Deposits
At the time of depositing money with the bank, a depositor would
want to be certain that his/her money is safe with the bank and at the same
time, wants to earn a reasonable return. The safety of depositors’ funds,
therefore, forms a key area of the regulatory framework for banking. In
India, this aspect is taken care of in the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (BR
Act).The RBI is empowered to issue directives/advices on several aspects
regarding the conduct of deposit accounts from time to time. Further,
the establishment of the Deposit Insurance Corporation in 1962 (against
the backdrop of failure of banks) offered protection to bank depositors,
particularly small-account holders.
Rates of Interest
The process of deregulation of interest rates started in April 1992.
Until then, all interest rates were regulated; that is, they were fixed by the
RBI. In other words, banks had no freedom to fix interest rates on their
deposits. With liberalization in the financial system, nearly all the interest
rates have now been deregulated. Now, banks have the freedom to fix their
own deposit rates with only a very few exceptions. The RBI prescribes
interest rates only in respect of savings deposits and NRI deposits, leaving
others for individual banks to determine.
51Notes
Deposit Policy
The Board of Directors of a bank, along with its top management,
formulates policies relating o the types of deposit the bank should have,
rates of interest payable on each type, special deposit schemes to be
introduced, types of customers to be targeted by the bank, etc. Of course,
depending on the changing economic environment, the policy of a bank
towards deposit mobilization undergoes changes.
Types of Deposit Accounts
The bank deposits can also be classified into (i) demand deposits
and (b) time deposits.
(i) Demand deposits are defined as deposits payable on demand
through cheque or otherwise. Demand deposits serve as a medium
of exchange, for their ownership can be transferred from one person
to another through cheques and clearing arrangements provided by
banks. They have no fixed term to maturity.
(ii) Time deposits are defined as those deposits which are not payable
on demand and on which cheques cannot be drawn. They have a
fixed term to maturity.
Demand and time deposits are two broad categories of deposits.
There are several deposit accounts offered by banks in India; but they can
be classified into three main categories:
1) Savings bank account
2) Current account
3) Term deposit account
Current account deposits fall entirely under the demand-deposit
category and term deposit account falls entirely under time deposit. Savings
bank accounts have both demand-deposit and time-deposit components.
In other words, some parts of savings deposits are considered demand
deposits and the rest as time deposits.
52Notes
Savings Bank Deposit
Savings deposits are a form of demand deposits, which is subject
to restrictions on the number of withdrawals as well as on the amounts
of withdrawals during any specified period. Further, minimum balances
may be prescribed in order to offset the cost of maintaining and servicing
such deposits. Savings deposits are deposits that accrue interest at a fixed
rate set by RBI. Savings bank accounts are used by a large segment of small
depositors as they can deposit their regular incomes into these accounts,
withdraw the money on demand and also earn interest on the balance left
in the account. The savings bank accounts cannot be opened by big trading
or business firms. Similarly, institutions such as government departments
and bodies, local authorities, etc. cannot open savings bank accounts.
Current Account Deposit
A current account is a form of demand-deposit, as the banker is
obliged to repay these liabilities on demands from the customer. Withdrawals
from current accounts are allowed any number of times depending upon
the balance in the account or up to a particular agreed amount. Current
deposits are non-interest bearing. A current account is basically a running
and actively operated account with very little restriction on the number
and amount of drawings. The primary objective of a current account is
to provide convenient operation facility to the customer, via continuous
liquidity. On account of the high cost of maintaining such accounts, banks
do not pay any interest on such deposits. In addition, many banks insist on
customers maintaining minimum balances to offset the transaction costs
involved. If minimum balances are not maintained, these banks charge
the customers a certain amount. Current accounts can be opened by rich
individuals/ partnership firms/ private and limited companies/ Hindu
Undivided Families (HUFs)/ societies/ trusts, etc.
Savings account deposits together with current account deposits
are called CASA deposits.
Term Deposit
A “Term deposit” is a deposit received by the Bank for a fixed
period, after which it can be withdrawn. Term deposits include deposits
53Notes
such as Fixed Deposits / Reinvestment deposits/Recurring Deposits etc.
The term deposits account for the largest share of total deposits in the
recent years. Interest is paid on term-deposits, either on maturity or at
stipulated intervals depending upon the deposit scheme under which the
money is placed. Also, a customer can earn interest on a term-deposit for
a minimum period of 7 days. Interest rates on term-deposits are usually
higher than on savings deposits. Term deposits include:
➢ ➢ 
Fixed deposits on which a fixed rate of interest is paid at fixed,
regular intervals;
➢ ➢ 
Re-investment deposits, under which the interest is compounded
quarterly and paid on maturity, along with the principal amount
of the deposit. Some banks have introduced “flexi” deposits under
which, the amount in savings deposit accounts beyond a fixed limit
is automatically converted into term-deposits; and
➢ ➢ 
Recurring deposits, under which a fixed amount is deposited at
regular intervals for a fixed term and the repayment of principal
and accumulated interest is made at the end of the term. These
deposits are usually targeted at persons who are salaried or receive
other regular income. A Recurring Deposit can usually be opened
for any period from6 months to 120 months.
Deposit Mobilization Strategies
To maximize their profits, commercial banks always attempt to
mobilize savings at the lowest cost possible. While mobilizing deposits,
banks have to comply with various directives issued by the RBI, the
Indian Bank Association (IBA), Government of India and other statutory
authorities/agencies. At the same time, since banks operate in a very
competitive environment, they have to reach out to a wide spectrum of
customers and also offer deposit products that lead to higher customer
satisfaction. Banks devise various strategies to expand the customer base
and reducing the cost of raising deposits. This is done by identifying target
markets, designing the products as per the requirements for customers,
taking measures for marketing and promoting the deposit products. It
is essential not only to expand the customer base but also to retain it.
This is done by providing counseling, after-sales information and also
through prompt handling of customer complaints. While the strategies for
54Notes
mobilizing bank deposits vary from bank to bank, one common feature
is to maximize the share of CASA deposits. The other common features
generally observed are as follows:
➢ ➢ 
Staff members posted at branches are adequately trained to offer
efficient and courteous service to the customers and to educate
them about their rights and obligations.
➢ ➢ 
A bank often offers personalized banking relationship for its high-
value customers by appointing Customer Relationship Managers
(CRMs).
➢ ➢ 
Senior citizens/pensioners have become an important category
of customers to be targeted by a bank. Products are developed by
banks to meet the specific requirements of this group.
➢ ➢ 
While banks endeavour to provide services to the satisfaction of
customers, they put in place an expeditious mechanism to redress
the complaints of the customers.
Common Guidelines for Opening and Operating Deposit Accounts
To open and operate a bank account, the following guidelines need
to be followed:
Due Diligence Process
Before opening any deposit account, the bank has to carry out due
diligence as required under “Know Your Customer” (KYC) guidelines
issued by RBI and or such other norms or procedures adopted by the
bank. The ‘due diligence’ process, while opening a deposit account,
involves the bank having adequate knowledge of the person’s identity,
occupation, sources of income, and location. Obtaining an introduction of
the prospective depositor from a person acceptable to the bank, obtaining
recent photographs of people opening/operating the account are part of
the due diligence process. For customers providing proof of identification
and address, there is no need for personal introduction to the bank for
opening of a new savings bank account. To promote financial inclusion
in rural areas / tribal areas, KYC norms have been relaxed for below the
poverty line (BPL) families.
55Notes
Minimum Balance
For deposit products like a savings bank account or a current
account, banks normally stipulate certain minimum balances to be
maintained as part of terms and conditions governing operation of such
accounts. But for people below the poverty line, banks encourage the
opening of ‘No-frills Accounts’, typically a special savings bank account
where no minimum balance requirement is required. For a savings bank
account, the bank may also place restrictions on number of transactions,
cash withdrawals, etc., during a given period.
Transparency
Failure to maintain minimum balance in the accounts, where
applicable, will attract levy of charges as specified by the bank from time
to time. Similarly, the bank may specify charges for issue of cheques books,
additional statement of accounts, duplicate pass book, folio charges, etc.
All such details regarding terms and conditions for operation of the
accounts and schedule of charges for various services provided should be
communicated to the prospective depositor while opening the account for
the sake of transparency.
Eligibility
A savings bank account can be opened by eligible person(s) and
certain organizations/agencies, as advised by the RBI from time to time.
But current accounts can be opened by individuals, partnership firms,
private and public limited companies, Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs),
specified associates, society trusts, etc. Eligibility criteria for a savings
account and a current account are largely similar, but there are important
differences too. While both the accounts can be opened by individuals, the
savings account cannot be opened by a firm. Term Deposit Accounts can
be opened by all categories of account holders.
Requirement of PAN
In addition to the due diligence requirements, under KYC norms,
banks are required by law to obtain a Permanent Account Number (PAN)
from the prospective account holder or alternate declarations as specified
under the Income Tax Act.
56Notes
Operation of Joint Account
Deposit accounts can be opened by an individual in his own name
or by more than one individual in their own names (known as a ‘joint
account’).A joint account can be operated by a single individual or by more
than one individual jointly. The mandate for who can operate the account
can be modified with the consent of all accountholders. Joint accounts
opened by minors with their parents or guardians can be only operated
by the latter. Accountholders of a joint account can give mandates on the
operation of the account, and the disposal of balances in the event of the
demise of one or more of the holders. Banks classify these mandates as
‘Either or Survivor’, and ‘Any one or Survivor(s)’, etc.
Power of Attorney
At the request of the depositor, the bank can register mandate/
power of attorney given by him authorizing another person to operate the
account on his behalf.
Closure/Renewal of Deposits
Term-deposit account holders at the time of placing their deposits
can give instructions with regard to closure of deposit account or renewal
of deposit for further period on the date of maturity. In absence of such
mandate, the bank will usually seek instructions from the depositor(s) as
to the renewal of the deposit or otherwise by sending intimation before
say, 15 days of the maturity date of the term deposit. If no mandate is given
or received by the bank before the date of maturity of term deposit, the
bank will be at liberty to roll over the deposit on due date.
Nomination
A depositor is permitted to officially authorize someone, who would
receive the money of his account when the depositor passes away. This is
called the nomination process. Nomination facility is available on all de-
posit accounts opened by individuals. Nomination is also available to a sole
proprietary concern account. Nomination can be made in favour of one in-
dividual only. Nomination so made can be cancelled or changed by the ac-
count holder/s anytime. Nomination can be made in favour of a minor too.
57Notes
Deposit Related Services
As per the RBI guidelines, banks are required to provide some
services to the depositors and to recognize the rights of depositors. The
ultimate objective of the banking industry should be to provide a customer
different services they are rightfully entitled to receive without demand.
Following are the deposit related services provided by banks:
Customer Information
Customer information collected from the customers should not be
used for cross-selling of services or products by the bank, its subsidiaries
and affiliates. If the bank proposes to use such information, it should be
strictly with the ‘express consent’ of the account-holder.
Banks are not expected to disclose details/particulars of the
customer’s account to a third person or party without the expressed or
implied consent from the customer. However, there are some exceptions,
such as disclosure of information under compulsion of law or where there
is a duty to public for the bank to disclose.
Interest Payment
Interest is paid on savings bank deposit account at the rate specified
by RBI from time to time. In case of savings bank accounts, till recently,
banks paid interest on the minimum balance between the 11th and the last
day of the month. With effect from April 1, 2010, banks have been advised
to calculate interest on savings bank deposit by considering daily product,
which would benefit the holders of savings bank accounts.
Term-deposit interest rates are decided by individual banks with in
these general guidelines. In terms of RBI directives, interest is calculated
at quarterly intervals on term deposits and paid at the rate decided by
the bank depending upon the period of deposits. The interest on term
deposits is calculated by the bank in accordance with the formulae and
conventions advised by Indian Bank Association.
58Notes
Tax Deducted at Source (TDS)
The bank has statutory obligation to deduct tax at source if the
total interest paid/payable on all term deposits held by a person exceeds
the amount specified under the Income Tax Act and rules there under.
The Bank will issue a tax deduction certificate (TDS Certificate) for the
amount of tax deducted. The depositor, if entitled to exemption from
TDS, can submit a declaration to the bank in the prescribed format at the
beginning of every financial year.
Premature Withdrawal of Term Deposit
The bank on request from the depositor, at its discretion, may allow
withdrawal of term-deposit before completion of the period of the deposit
agreed upon at the time of placing the deposit. Banks usually charge a
penalty for premature withdrawal of deposits. The bank shall declare their
penal interest rates policy for premature withdrawal of term deposit, if
any, at the time of opening of the account.
Premature Renewal of Term Deposit
In case the depositor desires to renew the deposit by seeking
premature closure of an existing term deposit account, the bank will
permit the renewal at the applicable rate on the date of renewal, provided
the deposit is renewed for a period longer than the balance period of the
original deposit. While prematurely closing a deposit for the purpose of
renewal, interest on the deposit for the period it has remained with the
bank will be paid at the rate applicable to the period for which the deposit
remained with the bank and not at the contracted rate.
Advances Against Deposit
The Bank may consider requests of the depositor(s) for loan/
overdraft facility against term deposits duly discharged by the depositor(s)
on execution of necessary security documents. The bank may also consider
giving an advance against a deposit standing in the name of minor.
However, a suitable declaration stating that the loan is for the benefit of
the minor, is to be furnished by the depositor-applicant.
59Notes
Settlement of Dues in Deceased Deposit Account
a) 
If the depositor has registered nomination with the bank; the
balance outstanding in the account of the deceased depositor will
be transferred/ paid to the nominee after the bank is satisfied about
the identity of the nominee, etc.
b) The above procedure will be followed even in respect of a joint
account where nomination is registered with the bank.
c) In case of joint deposit accounts where joint account holders do
not give any mandate for disposal, when one of the joint account
holders dies, the bank is required to make payment jointly to the
legal heirs of the deceased person and the surviving depositor(s).
In these cases, delays may ensue in the production of legal papers
by the heirs of the deceased. However, if the joint account holders
had given mandate for disposal of the balance in the account in the
forms such as ‘either or survivor’, ‘former/latter or survivor’, ‘anyone
of survivors or survivor’; etc., the payment will be made as per the
mandate. In such cases, there is no delay in production of legal
papers by the heirs of the deceased.
d) In the absence of nomination, the bank will pay the amount
outstanding to all legal heirs against joint application and on receipt
of the necessary documents, including court order.
Stop Payment Facility
The Bank will accept ‘stop payment’ instructions from the
depositors in respect of cheques issued by them. Charges, as specified, will
be recovered.
Dormant Accounts
Accounts which are not operated for a considerable period of time
(usually 12/24 months for savings bank accounts and 6/12 months for
current accounts), will be transferred to a separate dormant/inoperative
account status in the interest of the depositor as well as the bank. The
depositor will be informed if there are charges that the bank would levy
on dormant/inoperative accounts. Such accounts can be used again on an
activation request to the bank. Such a practice is in the interest of the
60Notes
depositor since it avoids the possibility of frauds on the account. It is also
in the interest of the bank as it reduces the servicing costs that the bank
would have had to incur if the account were to remain active.
Safe Deposit Locker
This facility is not offered through all bank branches and wherever
the facility is offered, allotment of safe deposit vault will be subject to
availability and compliance with other terms and conditions attached
to the service. Safe deposit lockers may be hired by an individual (not a
minor) singly or jointly with another individual(s), HUFs, firms, limited
companies, associates, societies, trusts etc. Nomination facility is available
to individual(s) holding the lockers singly or jointly. In the absence of
nomination or mandate for disposal of contents of lockers, with a view
to avoid hardship to common persons, the bank will release the contents
of locker to the legal heirs against indemnity on the lines as applicable to
deposit accounts.
Redress of Complaints and Grievance
Depositors having any complaint/grievance with regard to services
rendered by the bank have a right to approach the authorities designated
by the bank for handling customer complaints/grievances. In case the
depositor does not get a response from the bank within one month after the
bank receives his representation /complaint or he is not satisfied with the
response received from the bank, he has a right to approach the Banking
Ombudsman appointed by RBI.
Deposit Services Offered to Non-Resident Indians
Banks actively seek banking business from Non-Resident Indians
(NRIs) by offering different types of deposit accounts (and related services)
in accordance with RBI guidelines, including:
➢ ➢ 
Non-resident ordinary account;
➢ ➢ 
Non-resident (external) Rupee account; and
➢ ➢ 
Foreign currency non-resident account (Banks)
61Notes
Definition of Non-Resident Indian (NRI)
As per the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), 1999, an
NRI means: on-Resident Indian National (i.e. Non-resident Indian holding
Indian passport), and Persons of Indian Origin (i.e., Non-residents holding
foreign passports).
Non-Resident Indian Nationals Include
(i)
Indian citizens who proceed abroad for employment or for any
business or vocation in circumstances indicating an indefinite
period of stay outside India; NRI is defined differently under
different acts. For the purpose of bank accounts, FEMA definition
holds.
(ii) Indian citizens working abroad on assignments with foreign
governments, international/multinational agencies such as the
United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank
etc.
(iii) Officials of Central and State Governments and Public Sector
Undertakings (PSUs) deputed abroad on assignments with foreign
governments, multilateral agencies or Indian diplomatic missions
abroad.
PIO (Persons of Indian Origin) is defined as a citizen of any country
other than Bangladesh or Pakistan, if
➢ ➢ 
He has at any time held an Indian passport; or
➢ ➢ 
He or either of his parents or any of his grandparents was a citizen
of India; or
➢ ➢ 
The person is a spouse of an Indian citizen or a person referred to
in sub-clause (a) or (b).
In general, NRI is thus a person of Indian nationality or origin,
who is resident abroad for business or employment or vocation, or with
the intension of seeking employment or vocation and the period of stay
abroad is uncertain.
62Notes
Non Resident Ordinary Accounts (NRO)
These are Rupee accounts and can be opened by any person
resident outside India. Typically, when a resident becomes non-resident,
his domestic Rupee account gets converted into an NRO account. In
other words, it is basically a domestic account of an NRI which help him
get credits which accrue in India, such as rent from property or income
from other investments. New accounts can be opened by sending fresh
remittances from abroad. NRO accounts can be opened only as savings
account, current account, recurring deposits and term-deposit accounts.
Regulations on interest rates, tenors etc. are similar to those of domestic
accounts. While the principal of NRO deposits is non-repatriable, current
income such as interest earnings on NRO deposits are repatriable. Further,
NRI/PIO may remit an amount, not exceeding US$1millionper financial
year, for permissible transactions from these accounts.
Non-Resident (External) Rupee Account
The Non-Resident (External) Rupee Account NR(E)RA scheme,
also known as the NRE scheme, was introduced in 1970. This is a rupee
account. Any NRI can open an NRE account with funds remitted to India
through a bank abroad.
An NRE rupee account may be opened as current, savings, and
recurring or term deposit account. Since this account is maintained in
Rupees, the depositor is exposed to exchange risk. Thus, a student going
abroad for studies or a tourist going abroad for brief visit is not an NRI.
This is a repatriable account (for both interest and principal) and transfer
from/to another NRE account or FCNR (B) account (see below) is also
permitted. Local payments can also be freely made from NRE accounts.
NRIs / PIOs have the option to credit the current income to their NRE
accounts, provided income tax has been deducted / provided for. Interest
rates on NRE accounts are determined by the RBI, for both savings and
term deposits.
Foreign Currency Non Resident Account (Banks)
The Foreign Currency Non-Resident Account (Banks) or FCNR(B)
accounts scheme was introduced with effect from May 15, 1993 to replace
the then prevailing FCNR(A) scheme introduced in 1975.
63Notes
➢ ➢ 
These are foreign currency accounts, which can be opened by NRIs
in only designated currencies: Pound Sterling, US Dollar, Canadian
Dollar, Australian Dollar, EURO and Japanese Yen.
➢ ➢ 
Repatriation of principal amount and interest is permitted.
➢ ➢ 
These deposits can be opened only in the form of term deposits.
➢ ➢ 
Deposits are in foreign currency and are repaid in the currency of
issue. Hence, there is no exchange risk for the account holder.
➢ ➢ 
Transfer of funds from existing NRE accounts to FCNR (B) accounts
and vice- versa, of the same account holder, is permissible without
the prior approval of RBI.
A bank should obtain the prior approval of its Board of Directors
for the interest rates that it will offer on deposits of various maturities,
within the ceiling prescribed by RBI.
Deposit Insurance
Deposit insurance helps sustain public confidence in the banking
system through the protection of depositors, especially small depositors,
against loss of deposit to a significant extent. In India, bank deposits are
covered under the insurance scheme offered by Deposit Insurance and
Credit Guarantee Corporation of India (DICGC), which was established
with funding from the Reserve Bank of India. The scheme is subject to
certain limits and conditions. DICGC is a wholly-owned subsidiary
of the RBI. All commercial banks including branches of foreign banks
functioning in India, local area banks and regional rural banks are insured
by the DICGC. Further, all State, Central and Primary cooperative banks
functioning in States/Union Territories which have amended the local
Cooperative Societies Act empowering RBI suitably are insured by the
DICGC. Primary cooperative societies are not insured by the DICGC.
In the event of a bank failure, DICGC protects bank deposits that
are payable in India. DICGC is liable to pay if A bank goes into liquidation
If a bank is amalgamated/ merged with another bank. There are two
methods of protecting depositors’ interest when an insured bank fails:
(i) 
By transferring business of the failed bank to another sound bank
(in case of merger or amalgamation) and
64Notes
(ii) 
Where the DICGC pays insurance proceeds to depositors
(insurance pay-out method).Each depositor in a bank is insured up
to a maximum of `1,00,000 for both principal and interest amount
held by him in the same capacity and same right. Deposit insurance
premium is borne entirely by the insured bank. Banks are required
to pay the insurance premium for the eligible amount to the DICGC
on a semi-annual basis. The cost of the insurance premium cannot
be passed on to the customer. The deposit insurance scheme is
compulsory and no bank can withdraw from it. The DICGC, on
the other hand, can withdraw the deposit insurance cover for a
bank if it fails to pay the premium for three consecutive half year
periods. In the event of the DICGC withdrawing its cover from
any bank for default in the payment of premium, the public will be
notified through the newspapers.
Loans and Advances
Banks extend credit to different categories of borrowers for a wide
variety of purposes. For many borrowers, bank credit is the easiest to
access at reasonable interest rates. Bank credit is provided to households,
retail traders, small and medium enterprises (SMEs), corporate, the
Government undertakings etc. in the economy. Retail banking loans are
accessed by consumers of goods and services for financing the purchase
of consumer durables, housing or even for day-to-day consumption. In
contrast, the need for capital investment, and day-to-day operations of
private corporate and the Government undertakings are met through
wholesale lending. Loans for capital expenditure are usually extended with
medium and long-term maturities, while day-to-day finance requirements
are provided through short-term credit (working capital loans). Meeting
the financing needs of the agriculture sector is also an important role that
Indian banks play.
Principles of Lending
To lend, banks depend largely on deposits from the public. Banks
act as custodian of public deposits. Since the depositors require safety
and security of their deposits, want to withdraw deposits whenever they
need and also adequate return, bank lending must necessarily be based on
principles that reflect these concerns of the depositors. These principles
include: safety, liquidity, profitability, and risk diversion.
65Notes
Safety
Banks need to ensure that advances are safe and money lent out
by them will come back. Since the repayment of loans depends on the
borrowers’ capacity to pay, the banker must be satisfied before lending that
the business for which money is sought is a sound one. In addition, bankers
many times insist on security against the loan, which they fall back on if
things go wrong for the business. The security must be adequate, readily
marketable and free of encumbrances.
Liquidity
To maintain liquidity, banks have to ensure that money lent out
by them is not locked up for long time by designing the loan maturity
period appropriately. Further, money must comeback as per the repayment
schedule. If loans become excessively illiquid, it may not be possible for
bankers to meet their obligations vis-à-vis depositors.
Profitability
To remain viable, a bank must earn adequate profit on its investment.
This calls for adequate margin between deposit rates and lending rates.
In this respect, appropriate fixing of interest rates on both advances
and deposits is critical. Unless interest rates are competitively fixed and
margins are adequate, banks may lose customers to their competitors and
become unprofitable.
Risk Diversification
To mitigate risk, banks should lend to a diversified customer
base. Diversification should be in terms of geographic location, nature of
business etc. If, for example, all the borrowers of a bank are concentrated
in one region and that region gets affected by a natural disaster, the bank’s
profitability can be seriously affected.
Loan Policy
Based on the general principles of lending stated above, the Credit
Policy Committee (CPC) of individual banks prepares the basic credit policy
66Notes
of the Bank, which has to be approved by the Bank’s Board of Directors.
The loan policy outlines lending guidelines and establishes operating
procedures in all aspects of credit management including standards for
presentation of credit proposals, financial covenants, rating standards
and benchmarks, delegation of credit approving powers, prudential limits
on large credit exposures, asset concentrations, portfolio management,
loan review mechanism, risk monitoring and evaluation, pricing of loans,
provisioning for bad debts, regulatory/ legal compliance etc. The lending
guidelines reflect the specific bank’s lending strategy (both at the macro
level and individual borrower level) and have to be in conformity with RBI
guidelines. The loan policy typically lays down lending guidelines in the
following areas such as level of credit-deposit ratio, targeted portfolio mix,
hurdle ratings, loan pricing, collateral security.
Credit Deposit (CD) Ratio
A bank can lend out only a certain proportion of its deposits, since
some part of deposits have to be statutorily maintained as Cash Reserve
Ratio (CRR) deposits, and an additional part has to be used for making
investment in prescribed securities (Statutory Liquidity Ratio or SLR
requirement). It may be noted that these are minimum requirements.
Banks have the option of having more cash reserves than CRR requirement
and invest more in SLR securities than they are required to. Further, banks
also have the option to invest in non-SLR securities. Therefore, the CPC
has to lay down the quantum of credit that can be granted by the bank
as a percentage of deposits available. Currently, the average CD ratio of
the entire banking industry is around 70 percent, though it differs across
banks. It is rarely observed that banks lend out of their borrowings.
Targeted Portfolio Mix
The CPC aims at a targeted portfolio mix keeping in view both
risk and return. Toward this end, it lays down guidelines on choosing the
preferred areas of lending (such as sunrise sectors and profitable sectors)
as well as the sectors to avoid. Banks typically monitor all major sectors of
the economy. They target a portfolio mix in the light of forecasts for growth
and profitability for each sector. If a bank perceives economic weakness in
a sector, it would restrict new exposures to that segment and similarly,
growing and profitable sectors of the economy prompt banks to increase
67Notes
new exposures to those sectors. This entails active portfolio management.
Further, the bank also has to decide which sectors to avoid.
Hurdle Ratings
There are a number of diverse risk factors associated with
borrowers. Banks should have a comprehensive risk rating system that
serves as a single point indicator of diverse risk factors of a borrower.
This helps taking credit decisions in a consistent manner. To facilitate
this, a substantial degree of standardization is required in ratings across
borrowers. The risk rating system should be so designed as to reveal the
overall risk of lending. For new borrowers, a bank usually lays down
guidelines regarding minimum rating to be achieved by the borrower
to become eligible for the loan. This is also known as the ‘hurdle rating’
criterion to be achieved by a new borrower.
Pricing of Loans
Risk-return trade-off is a fundamental aspect of risk management.
Borrowers with weak financial position and, hence, placed in higher risk
category are provided credit facilities at a higher price (that is, at higher
interest). The higher the credit risk of a borrower the higher would be his
cost of borrowing. To price credit risks, banks devise appropriate systems,
which usually allow flexibility for revising the price (risk premium) due
to changes in rating. In other words, if the risk rating of a borrower
deteriorates, his cost of borrowing should rise and vice versa. At the
macro level, loan pricing for a bank is dependent upon a number of its
cost factors such as cost of raising resources, cost of administration and
overheads, cost of reserve assets like CRR and SLR, cost of maintaining
capital, percentage of bad debt, etc. Loan pricing is also dependent upon
competition.
Collateral Security
As part of a prudent lending policy, banks usually advance loans
against some security. The loan policy provides guidelines for this. In
the case of term loans and working capital assets, banks take as ‘primary
security’ the property or goods against which loans are granted. In addition
to this, banks often ask for additional security or ‘collateral security’ in the
68Notes
form of both physical and financial assets to further bind the borrower.
This reduces the risk for the bank. Sometimes, loans are extended as ‘clean
loans’ for which only personal guarantee of the borrower is taken.
Compliance with RBI Guidelines
The credit policy of a bank should be conformant with RBI
guidelines; some of the important guidelines of the RBI relating to bank
credit are discussed below.
Directed Credit Stipulation
The RBI lays down guidelines regarding minimum advances to
be made for priority sector advances, export credit finance, etc. These
guidelines need to be kept in mind while formulating credit policies for
the Bank.
Capital Adequacy
If a bank creates assets-loans or investment-they are required to be
backed up by bank capital; the amount of capital they have to be backed
up by depends on the risk of individual assets that the bank acquires. The
riskier the asset, the larger would be the capital it has to be backed up by.
This is so, because bank capital provides a cushion against unexpected
losses of banks and riskier assets would require larger amounts of capital
to act as cushion. The Basel Committee for Bank Supervision (BCBS) has
prescribed a set of norms for the capital requirement for the banks for all
countries to follow. These norms ensure that capital should be adequate
to absorb unexpected losses. In addition, all countries, including India,
establish their own guidelines for risk based capital framework known as
Capital Adequacy Norms.
These norms have to be at least as stringent as the norms set by
the Basel committee. A key norm of the Basel committee is the Capital
Adequacy Ratio (CAR), also known as Capital Risk Weighted Assets
Ratio, is a simple measure of the soundness of a bank. The ratio is the
capital with the bank as a percentage of its risk-weighted assets. Given the
level of capital available with an individual bank, this ratio determines
the maximum extent to which the bank can lend. The Basel committee
69Notes
specifies a CAR of at least 8% the bank’s risk weighted assets for banks.
In India, the RBI has specified a minimum of 9%, which is more stringent
than the international norm. In fact, the actual ratio of all scheduled
commercial banks (SCBs) in India stood at 13.2% in March 2009.The RBI
also provides guidelines about how much risk weights banks should assign
to different classes of assets (such as loans).
Credit Exposure Limits
As a prudential measure aimed at better risk management and
avoidance of concentration of credit risks, the Reserve Bank has fixed
limits on bank exposure to the capital market as well as to individual and
group borrowers with reference to a bank’s capital. Limits on inter-bank
exposures have also been placed. Banks are further encouraged to place
internal caps on their sectoral exposures, their exposure to commercial
real estate and to unsecured exposures.
These exposures are closely monitored by the Reserve Bank.
Prudential norms on banks’ exposures to NBFCs and to related entities are
also in place. RBI has given guidelines on exposure norms for commercial
banks in India. Further, a Bank may fix its own credit exposure limits
for mitigating credit risk. The bank may, for example, set upper caps on
exposures to sensitive sectors like commodity sector, real estate sector and
capital markets. Banks also may lay down guidelines regarding exposure
limits to unsecured loans.
Lending Rates
Banks are free to determine their own lending rates on all kinds
of advances except a few such as export finance; interest rates on these
exceptional categories of advances are regulated by the RBI. It may be noted
that the Section 21A of the BR Act provides that the rate of interest charged
by a bank shall not be reopened by any court on the ground that the rate of
interest charged is excessive. The concept of benchmark prime lending rate
(BPLR) was however introduced in November 2003 for pricing of loans
by commercial banks with the objective of enhancing transparency in
the pricing of their loan products. Each bank must declare its benchmark
prime lending rate (BPLR) as approved by its Board of Directors. A bank’s
BPLR is the interest rate to be charged to its best clients; that is, clients with
70Notes
the lowest credit risk. Each bank is also required to indicate the maximum
spread over the BPLR for various credit exposures. However, BPLR lost
its relevance over time as a meaningful reference rate, as the bulk of loans
were advanced below BPLR. According to RBI guidelines, the ‘Base Rate
system’ will replace the BPLR system with effect from July 01, 2010.All
categories of loans should henceforth be priced only with reference to the
Base Rate. Each bank will decide its own Base Rate.
The actual lending rates charged to borrowers would be the
Base Rate plus borrower-specific charges, which will include product-
specific operating costs, credit risk premium and tenor premium. Since
transparency in the pricing of loans is a key objective, banks are required
to exhibit the information on their Base Rate at all branches and also on
their websites. Changes in the Base Rate should also be conveyed to the
general public from time to time through appropriate channels. Apart from
transparency, banks should ensure that interest rates charged to customers
in the above arrangement are non-discriminatory in nature.
Guidelines on Fair Practices Code for Lender
RBI has been encouraging banks to introduce a fair practices code
for bank loans. Loan application forms in respect of all categories of loans
irrespective of the amount of loan sought by the borrower should be
comprehensive. It should include information about the fees/ charges, if
any, payable for processing the loan, the amount of such fees refundable
in the case of non-acceptance of application, prepayment options and any
other matter which affects the interest f the borrower, so that a meaningful
comparison with the fees charged by other banks can be made and
informed decision can be taken by the borrower. Further, the banks must
inform ‘all-in-cost’ to the customer to enable him to compare the rates
charged with other sources of finance.
Regulations Relating to Providing Loans
The provisions of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (BR Act) govern
the making of loans by banks in India. RBI issues directions covering the
loan activities of banks. Some of the major guidelines of RBI, which are
now in effect, are as follows:
71Notes
Advances Against Banks Own Shares
A bank cannot grant any loans and advances against the security of
its own shares.
Advances to Bank’s Directors
The BR Act lays down the restrictions on loans and advances to the
directors and the firms in which they hold substantial interest.
Restrictions on Holding Shares in Companies
In terms of Section 19(2) of the BR Act, banks should not hold
shares in any company except as provided in sub-section (1) whether as
pledge, mortgagee or absolute owner, of an amount exceeding 30%of the
paid-up share capital of that company or 30% of its own paid-up share
capital and reserves, whichever is less.
Basics of Loan Appraisal, Credit Decision-Making and Review
Credit Approval Authorities
The Bank’s Board of Directors also has to approve the delegation
structure of the various credit approval authorities. Banks establish multi-
tier credit approval authorities for corporate banking activities, small
enterprises, retail credit, agricultural credit, etc.
Concurrently, each bank should set up a Credit Risk Management
Department (CMRD), being independent of the CPC. The CRMD should
enforce and monitor compliance of the risk parameters and prudential
limits set up by the CPC.
Credit Appraisal and Credit Decision-Making
When a loan proposal comes to the bank, the banker has to decide
how much funds the proposal really requires for it to be a viable project and
what are the credentials of those who are seeking the project. In checking
the credentials of the potential borrowers, Credit Information Bureaus
play an important role. Credit information bureaus are thus repositories
72Notes
of information, which contains the credit history of commercial and
individual borrowers. They provide this information to their Members in
the form of credit information reports. To get a complete picture of the
payment history of a credit applicant, credit grantors must be able to gain
access to the applicant’s complete credit record that may be spread over
different institutions. Credit information bureaus collect commercial and
consumer credit-related data and collate such data to create credit reports,
which they distribute to their Members. A Credit Information Report
(CIR) is a factual record of a borrower’s credit payment history compiled
from information received from different credit grantors. Its purpose is
to help credit grantors make informed lending decisions - quickly and
objectively. As of today, bureaus provide history of credit card holders and
SMEs.
Monitoring and Review of Loan Portfolio
It is not only important for banks to follow due processes at the time
of sanctioning and disbursing loans, it is equally important to monitor
the loan portfolio on a continuous basis. Banks need to constantly keep a
check on the overall quality of the portfolio. They have to ensure that the
borrower utilizes the funds for the purpose for which it is sanctioned and
complies with the terms and conditions of sanction. Further, they monitor
individual borrows accounts and check to see whether borrowers in
different industrial sectors are facing difficulty in making loan repayment.
Information technology has become an important tool for efficient
handling of the above functions including decision support systems and
data bases.
Such a surveillance and monitoring approach helps to mitigate
credit risk of the portfolio. Banks have set up Loan Review Departments
or Credit Audit Departments in order to ensure compliance with extant
sanction and post-sanction processes and procedures laid down by the
Bank from time to time. This is especially applicable for the larger advances.
The Loan Review Department helps a bank to improve the quality of the
credit portfolio by detecting early warning signals, suggesting remedial
measures and providing the top management with information on credit
administration, including the credit sanction process, risk evaluation and
post-sanction follow up.
73Notes
Types of Loans &Advances
Advances can be broadly classified into: fund-based lending
and non-fund based lending. Fund based lending: This is a direct form
of lending in which a loan with an actual cash outflow is given to the
borrower by the Bank. In most cases, such a loan is backed by primary
and/or collateral security. The loan can be to provide for financing capital
goods and/or working capital requirements. Let us discuss some important
types of fund-based lending.
Working Capital Finance
Working capital finance is utilized for operating purposes, resulting
in creation of current assets (such as inventories and receivables). This is
in contrast to term loans which are utilized for establishing or expanding
a manufacturing unit by the acquisition of fixed assets. Banks carry out a
detailed analysis of borrowers’ working capital requirements. Credit limits
are established in accordance with the process approved by the board of
directors. The limits on Working capital facilities are primarily secured
by inventories and receivables (chargeable current assets).Working capital
finance consists mainly of cash credit facilities, short term loan and bill
discounting. Under the cash credit facility, a line of credit is provided up
to a pre-established amount based on the borrower’s projected level of
sales inventories, receivables and cash deficits. Up to this pre-established
amount, disbursements are made based on the actual level of inventories
and receivables. Here the borrower is expected to buy inventory on
payments and, thereafter, seek reimbursement from the Bank. In reality,
this may not happen. The facility is generally given for a period of up to 12
months and is extended after a review of the credit limit.
Project Finance
Project finance business consists mainly of extending medium-term
and long-term rupee and foreign currency loans to the manufacturing and
infrastructure sectors. Banks also provide financing by way of investment
in marketable instruments such as fixed rate and floating rate debentures.
Lending banks usually insist on having a first charge on the fixed assets
of the borrower. During the recent years, the larger banks are increasingly
becoming involved in financing large projects, including infrastructure
74Notes
projects. Given the large amounts of financing involved, banks need to
have a strong framework for project appraisal. The adopted framework
will need to emphasize proper identification of projects, optimal allocation
and mitigation of risks. The project finance approval process entails a
detailed evaluation of technical, commercial, financial and management
factors and the project sponsor’s financial strength and experience. As part
of the appraisal process, a risk matrix is generated, which identifies each of
the project risks, mitigating factors and risk allocation.
Loans to Small and Medium Enterprises
A substantial quantum of loans is granted by banks to small and
medium enterprises (SMEs).While granting credit facilities to smaller
units, banks often use a cluster-based approach, which encourages
financing of small enterprises that have a homogeneous profile such as
leather manufacturing units, chemical units, or even export oriented
units. For assessing the credit risk of individual units, banks use the credit
scoring models. As per RBI guidelines, banks should use simplified credit
appraisal methods for assessment of bank finance for the smaller units.
Further, banks have also been advised that they should not insist on
collateral security for loans up to `10 lakh for the micro enterprises.
Rural and Agricultural Loan: The rural and agricultural loan
portfolio of banks comprises loans to farmers, small and medium
enterprises in rural areas, dealers and vendors linked to these entities and
even corporate. For farmers, banks extend term loans for equipments used
in farming, including tractors, pump sets, etc. Banks also extend crop loan
facility to farmers. In agricultural financing, banks prefer an ‘area based’
approach; for example, by financing farmers in an adopted village. The
regional rural banks (RRBs) have a special place in ensuring adequate
credit flow to agriculture and the rural sector.
Directed Lending
The RBI requires banks to deploy a certain minimum amount of
their credit in certain identified sectors of the economy. This is called
directed lending. Such directed lending comprises priority sector lending
and export credit.
75Notes
a) Priority sector lending: The objective of priority sector lending
program is to ensure that adequate credit flows into some of the
vulnerable sectors of the economy, which may not be attractive
for the banks from the point of view of profitability. These sectors
include agriculture, small scale enterprises, retail trade, etc. Small
housing loans, loans to individuals for pursuing education, loans
to weaker sections of the society etc also qualify as priority sector
loans. To ensure banks channelize a part of their credit to these
sectors, the RBI has set guidelines defining targets for lending to
priority sector as whole and in certain cases, sub-targets for lend-
ing to individual priority sectors. The RBI guidelines require banks
to lend at least 40% of Adjusted Net Bank Credit (ANBC) or cred-
it equivalent amount of Off-Balance Sheet Exposure (CEOBSE),
whichever is higher. In case of foreign banks, the target for priority
sector advances is 32% of ANBC or CEOBSE, whichever is higher.
In addition to these limits for overall priority sector lending, the
RBI sets sub-limits for certain sub-sectors within the priority sector
such as agriculture. Banks are required to comply with the prior-
ity sector lending requirements at the end of each financial year. A
bank having shortfall in lending to priority sector lending target or
sub-target shall be required to make contribution to the Rural In-
frastructure Development Fund (RIDF) established with NABARD
or funds with other financial institutions as specified by the RBI.
b) Export Credit: As part of directed lending, RBI requires banks to
make loans to exporters at concessional rates of interest. Export
credit is provided for pre-shipment and post-shipment requirements
of exporter borrowers in rupees and foreign currencies. At the end
of any fiscal year, 12.0% of a bank’s credit is required to be in the
form of export credit. This requirement is in addition to the priority
sector lending requirement but credits extended to exporters that
are small scale industries or small businesses may also meet part of
the priority sector lending requirement.
Retail Loan
Banks, today, offer a range of retail asset products, including home
loans, automobile loans, personal loans (for marriage, medical expenses
etc), credit cards, consumer loans (such as TV sets, personal computers
76Notes
etc) and, loans against time deposits and loans against shares. Banks also
may fund dealers who sell automobiles, two wheelers, consumer durables
and commercial vehicles. Customers for retail loans are typically middle
and high-income, salaried or self-employed individuals, and, in some
cases, proprietorship and partnership firms. Except for personal loans and
credit through credit cards, banks stipulate that
(a) 
A certain percentage of the cost of the asset (such as a home or
a TV set) sought to be financed by the loan, to be borne by the
borrower and
(b) 
That the loans are secured by the asset financed. In making credit
decisions, banks draw upon reports from agencies such as the Credit
Information Bureau (India) Limited (CIBIL) about borrowers.
Some private sector banks use direct marketing associates as well
as their own branch network and employees for marketing retail
credit products. However, credit approval authority lies only with
the bank’s credit officers. Two important categories of retail loans
are home finance and personal loans.
Home Finance: Banks extend home finance loans, either directly
or through home finance subsidiaries. Such long term housing loans are
provided to individuals and corporations and also given as construction
finance to builders. The loans are secured by a mortgage of the property
financed. These loans are extended for maturities generally ranging from
five to fifteen years and a large proportion of these loans are at floating
rates of interest. This reduces the interest rate risk that banks assume, since
a bank’s sources of finance are generally of shorter maturity. However,
fixed rate loans may also be provided; usually with banks keeping a higher
margin over benchmark rates in order to compensate for higher interest
rate risk. Equated monthly installments are fixed for repayment of loans
depending upon the income and age of the borrower(s).
Personal Loans: These are often unsecured loans provided
to customers who use these funds for various purposes such as higher
education, medical expenses, social events and holidays. Sometimes
collateral security in the form of physical and financial assets may be
available for securing the personal loan. Portfolio of personal loans also
includes micro-banking loans, which are relatively small value loans
extended to lower income customers in urban and rural areas.
77Notes
International Loans Extended by Banks
Indian corporate raise foreign currency loans from banks based
in India as well as abroad as per guidelines issued by RBI/ Government
of India. Banks raise funds abroad for on-lending to Indian corporate.
Further, banks based in India have an access to deposits placed by Non-
Resident Indians (NRIs) in the form of FCNR (B) deposits, which can be
used by banks in India for on-lending to Indian customers.
Non-Fund Based Lending
In this type of facility, the Bank makes no funds outlay. However,
such arrangements may be converted to fund-based advances if the client
fails to fulfill the terms of his contract with the counterparty. Such facilities
are known as contingent liabilities of the bank. Facilities such as ‘letters of
credit’ and ‘guarantees’ fall under the category of non-fund based credit.
Management of Non Performing Assets
An asset of a bank (such as a loan given by the bank) turns into a
non-performing asset (NPA) when it ceases to generate regular income
such as interest etc for the bank. In other words, when a bank which lends
a loan does not get back its principal and interest on time, the loan is
said to have turned into an NPA. While NPAs are a natural fall-out of
undertaking banking business and hence cannot be completely avoided,
high levels of NPAs can severely erode the bank’s profits, its capital
and ultimately its ability to lend further funds to potential borrowers.
Similarly, at the macro level, a high level of non-performing assets means
choking off credit to potential borrowers, thus lowering capital formation
and economic activity. So the challenge is to keep the growth of NPAs
under control. Clearly, it is important to have a robust appraisal of loans,
which can reduce the chances of loan turning into an NPA. Also, once a
loan starts facing difficulties, it is important for the bank to take remedial
action.
According to the RBI guidelines, banks must classify their assets
on an on-going basis into the following four categories such as standard
assets, sub-standard assets, doubtful assets and loss assets.
78Notes
Once a borrower faces difficulty in repaying loans or paying
interest, the bank should initially address the problem by trying to verify
whether the financed company is viable in the long run. If the company/
project is viable, then rehabilitation is possible by restructuring the credit
facilities. In a restructuring exercise, the bank can change the repayment
or interest payment schedule to improve the chances of recovery or even
make some sacrifices in terms of waiving interest etc.RBI has separate
guidelines for restructured loans. To create an institutional mechanism
for the restructuring of corporate debt, RBI has devised a Corporate Debt
Restructuring (CDR) system. The objective of this framework is to ensure
a timely and transparent mechanism for the restructuring of corporate
debts of viable entities facing problems.
Banks utilize the Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial
Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 (SARFAESI) as an
effective tool for NPA recovery. It is possible where non-performing assets
are backed by securities charged to the Bank by way of hypothecation or
mortgage or assignment. Upon loan default, banks can seize the securities
(except agricultural land) without intervention of the court. SARFAESI
is effective only for secured loans where bank can enforce the underlying
security e.g. hypothecation, pledge and mortgages. In such cases, court
intervention is not necessary, unless the security is invalid or fraudulent.
However, if the asset in question is an unsecured asset, the bank would
have to move the court to file civil case against the defaulters.
The SARFAESI Act, 2002 gives powers of “seize and desist” to
banks. Banks can give a notice in writing to the defaulting borrower
requiring it to discharge its liabilities within 60 days. If the borrower fails
to comply with the notice, the Bank may take recourse to one or more of
the following measures: Take possession of the security for the loan; Sale
or lease or assign the right over the security; and manage the same or
appoint any person to manage the same. The SARFAESI Act also provides
for the establishment of asset reconstruction companies regulated by RBI
to acquire assets from banks and financial institutions. The Act provides
for sale of financial assets by banks and financial institutions to asset
reconstruction companies (ARCs). RBI has issued guidelines to banks on
the process to be followed for sales of financial assets to ARCs.
79Notes
Balance Sheet of a Bank
Banks are a key intermediary in the financial sector. Being
companies, they are covered by the Companies Act, 1956. The Act,
through Schedule VI has specified a format for financial statements of
companies. The Accounting Standards Board of the Institute of Chartered
Accountants of India (ICAI) formulates accounting standards, with a
view to harmonize the accounting policies and practices. The Schedule
VI was revised by Ministry of Corporate Affairs on March 3, 2011. The
revised Schedule VI has been framed as per the existing non-converged
Indian Accounting Standards notified under the Companies (Accounting
Standards), Rules, 2006 and has no connection with the converged Indian
Accounting Standards. Important changes in the revised Schedule VI
include
a) 
Only vertical form is allowed;
b) 
Unit of measurement should be uniform;
c) 
“sources of funds” has been replaced with “Equity & Liabilities”;
Liabilities will be classified as current and non-current liabilities;
Schedules are eliminated and additional information are to be
provided in the Notes to Accounts.
RBI, on its part, wishes to align Indian banking system with global
standards. Further, since banking companies are different from normal
manufacturing companies, direct application of the ICAI standards to
banking companies created issues. With a view to eliminating gaps in
compliance with accounting standards by banks, a Working Group was
created. The recommendations of the Working Group were accepted by
RBI. Accordingly, RBI has issued guidelines to be followed by banks.
Balance Sheet of a Bank
Balance sheet of a bank brings out its financial operations for that
particular period and one can find out the extent of operating profits
earned by a bank compared to its previous year. In addition to this, the
balance sheet also depicts the financial soundness of the bank. This can be
found from the funds that are owned and borrowed by the bank and the
way they are developed.
80Notes
The liability side of the balance sheet has owned funds in the form
of capital and reserves, followed by borrowed funds, consisting of deposits
and other borrowings. The asset side of the balance sheet is on the basis of
descending order of liquidity and ascending order of profitability. That is,
cash being highly liquid asset, finds its first place followed by money at
call and short notice, investments and advances. From the point of view
of profitability, we find that cash comes as the last item on the ascending
order as cash on hand does not bring any return to the bank.
The following summarized balance sheet of a bank gives an idea of
the nature of items that feature in a bank’s balance sheet.

Now, let us analyze the items of balance sheet.
Capital and Liabilities
Capital: Every bank will have an authorized capital. This is the
maximum capital that a bank is allowed to raise by issue of shares. In the
case of public sector banks, this may be completely contributed by the
81Notes
government. But in the case of private sector banks, different types of
shareholders contribute this. As per the Banking Regulation Act, issued
capital should not be less than 50% of authorized capital and the subscribed
capital should not be less than 50% of the issued capital.
Paid up capital should not be less than 50% of subscribed capital.
This shows that from the authorized capital, a bank should issue shares with
a minimum of not less than 50%, which is called issued capital. Subscribed
capital is that which the public have agreed to subscribe and this should
not be less than 50% of the issued capital. Paid up capital is what actually
paid by the shareholders which should not be less than 50% of subscribed
capital. For example, if an amount of ` 10 crores is authorized capital, ` 5
crores will be issued capital. ` 2.5 crores, which is 50% of issued capital,
will be subscribed capital. ` 1.25 crores will be the paid up capital. These
are all the minimum requirements as per the law; it can be more than this
also. As per the International Banking Convention (BASLE), every bank
must have core capital, which should be minimum 4% of its deposits and
another 4% of capital based on risk-weighted asset structure.
Reserves and Surplus: As per Section 17 of the Banking Regulation
Act, every bank must compulsorily allocate 20% of its profit towards
reserve fund. A bank cannot declare any dividend until it has built-up
reserve fund, equivalent to its paid-up capital. Hence, all the banks will
allocate entire profit towards reserve fund until it become equivalent to
‘paid up capital’. Surplus here represents the surplus earning left over after
distributing dividends and other statutory provisions. Share premiums
will also come under surplus.
Deposits: This is the biggest utility of any bank. It is based on the
confidence created by the bank on public minds, banks mobilize deposits.
The deposits so mobilized can be broadly classified into- Demand deposit
and Time deposit.
Borrowings: A bank borrows from RBI to meet its current
requirements, as the interest rate charged by RBI called the Bank rate will
be less than market rate. In addition to this, banks will also go for inter
bank borrowings to meet the customers’ obligations. There will also be
borrowings by commercial banks from foreign banks in terms of foreign
exchange. Thus, bank borrowings will be from within India as well as
82Notes
outside India. Banks also discount their first class bills when they happened
to be Scheduled banks. In order to meet short term requirements, they
borrow from money market. There is also money market mutual funds
promoted by banks for the purpose of raising short-term loans.
Other Liabilities and Provisions: Bills payable will form part
of other liabilities. Drafts, telegraphic transfers, mail transfers, electronic
clearance etc., will form a part of this. Interest due on deposits and
borrowings will also be included in this. Outstanding charges like rent,
conveyance, tax deducted at source, etc., will be included in this schedule.
Assets
Cash and Balance with RBI: Every bank should maintain certain
amount of deposits as cash on hand to meet the demands of customers.
This includes apart from domestic currency, foreign currencies also. The
factors which decide the balance include statutory requirements, business
conditions, banking habit of the people, well Developed Banking System,
clearing house facilities, and seasonal stringency
Balance with banks and money at call and short notice: Next
to cash on hand, the most liquid asset is the balance with other banks
and money at call and short notice. Banks maintain balances with other
commercial banks towards inter-bank loans. These loans are called Call
loans as they can be obtained within 24 hours notice from other banks.
During the busy season, banks will go for inert-bank loans, as they are not
only cheaper but also safe. A bank instead of keeping cash idle would like
to lend to its counterparts (i.e, the other banks) for some nominal interest.
Money at call and short notice represents loan given by banks to either bill
market brokers or to stock market brokers for a very short period. These
loans can be called back even within 24 hours notice. But in India, money
at call and short notice represents inter-bank call loans.
Investment: A bank has a moral responsibility towards its
depositors in not only providing proper interest but also safeguarding their
interests. A bank has a commercial obligation towards its shareholders and
has to provide them attractive dividend. As a compromise, to protect the
interest of both-the depositors and shareholders, a bank will have to go in for
such an investment, which will provide better returns while maintaining the
83Notes
safety and security of the assets at the same time. The investment policy of
a bank consists of three basic principles of safety, liquidity and profitability.
In addition to this, national interest and statutory requirements have to be
fulfilled also.
Advances: Loans and advances form a part of bank asset. Loans are
different from advances. In loans, the banker will insist on security and
based on its market value, the loan amount will be decided. The purpose
of the loan will not be the concern of the bank. Thus, pledge, mortgage,
assignment are some of the loans granted by banks. In advances, the bank
will give advances for a specific purpose and such an amount cannot
be spent for any other purpose other than specified one. Examples for
advances are working capital or fixed capital.
Fixed assets: Land, building, furniture and fittings etc., will come
under this category. The bank will provide necessary depreciation.
Other assets: This represents non-banking assets acquired by banks
by way of claims from the customers. The assets might have been given as
security for loans and due to default the bank will recover the asset as a
part of claim.
Contingent liabilities: Here, the bank will show guarantees given
in India and outside India for loans extended to customers. There may
also be outstanding rent, electricity, telephone charges, etc., which will be
shown under this item.
Bills for Collection: Customers hand over to the bank, both
domestic and foreign bills for collection. For this, the bank will charge
service charges. With the help of its branches, these bills are collected and
credited to the respective customers’ account.
CAMELS Framework
‘CAMELS’ is a framework for composite evaluation of
banks (and financial intermediaries, in general). The acronym stands for:
84Notes
Capital Adequacy: This is a measure of financial strength, in
particular its ability to cushion operational and abnormal losses. It is
calculated based on the asset structure of the bank, and the risk weights
that have been assigned by the regulator for each asset class.
Asset Quality: This depends on factors such as concentration of
loans in the portfolio, related party exposure and provisions made for loan
loss.
Management: Management of the bank obviously influences the
other parameters. Operating cost per unit of money lent and earnings per
employee are parameters used.
Earnings: This can be measured through ratios like return on
assets, return on equity and interest spread.
Liquidity: In order to meet obligations as they come, the bank
needs an effective asset-liability management system that balances gaps in
the maturity profile of assets and liabilities. However, if the bank provides
too much liquidity, then it will suffer in terms of profitability. This can be
measured by the Loans to Deposit ratio, separately for short term, medium
term and long term.
Sensitivity to Market Risk: Longer the maturity of debt investments,
more prone it is to valuation losses, if interest rates go up. More sensitive
the portfolio is to market risk, the more risky the bank is.
Assets and Liabilities Management of Bank
Banks are always aiming at maximizing profitability at the same
time trying to ensure sufficient liquidity to repose confidence in the minds
of the depositors on their ability in servicing the deposits by making timely
payment of interest/returning them on due dates and meeting all other
liability commitments as agreed upon. To achieve these objectives, it is
essential that banks have to monitor, maintain and manage their assets
and liabilities portfolios in a systematic manner taking into account the
various risks involved in these areas. This concept has gained importance
in Indian conditions in the wake of the ongoing financial sector reforms,
particularly reforms relating to interest rate deregulation. The technique
85Notes
of managing both assets and liabilities together has come into being as a
strategic response of banks to inflationary pressure, volatility in interest
rates and severe recessionary trends which marked the global economy in
the seventies and eighties.
Assets and Liabilities Management (ALM) is a dynamic process
of planning, organizing, coordinating and controlling the assets and
liabilities – their mixes, volumes, maturities, yields and costs in order to
achieve a specified Net Interest Income (NII). The NII is the difference
between interest income and interest expenses and the basic source of
banks profitability. The easing of controls on interest rates has led to
higher interest rate volatility in India. Hence, there is a need to measure
and monitor the interest rate exposure of Indian banks. ALM is a system
of matching cash inflows and outflows, and thus of liquidity management.
The ALM system rests on three pillars, i.e.,
a) 
ALM Information system (MIS)
b) 
ALM organization (Structure and responsibilities)
c) 
ALM Process (Risk parameters, identifying, measuring, managing
risks and setting risk policies and tolerance levels).
Adopting an asset/liability management philosophy is an important
first step in drafting ALM policy. The philosophy should set out the broad
goals and objectives of the bank’s asset/liability portfolio, as established by
the board of directors, who represent the membership at large. The ALM
philosophy should always address the following principles:
➢ ➢ 
The bank will manage its asset cash flows in relation to its liability
cash flows in a manner that contributes adequately to earnings and
limits the risk to the financial margin.
➢ ➢ 
Product terms, pricing and balance sheet mix must balance product
demands with the need to protect the equity of the bank.
➢ ➢ 
Financial derivatives instruments must only be used to limit interest
rate risk and must never be used for speculative or investment
purposes.
86Notes
Balance Sheet Risk
Balance sheet risk can be categorized into two major types of
significant risks, which are liquidity risk and interest rate risk. Interest rate
risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from movement of interest
rates. It arises from differences between the timing of rate changes and
the timing of cash flows (re-pricing risk); from changing rate relationships
among yield curves that affect bank activities (basis risk);from changing
rate relationships across the spectrum of maturities (yield curve risk);and
from interest-rate-related options embedded in bank products (option
risk). The value of a bank’s assets, liabilities, and interest-rate-related, off-
balance-sheet contracts is affected by a change in rates because the present
value of future cash flows, and in some cases the cash flows themselves, is
changed. For measuring interest rate risk, banks use a variety of method
such as gap analysis, the duration gap method, the basis point value (BPV)
method, and simulation methods.
Matching Maturities
Policy should require that, as much as possible, liability maturities
and cash flows correlate to asset maturities and cash flows. “Matching”
refers to the process of structuring the balance sheet so that maturities of
interest rate sensitive assets correspond closely to the maturities of interest
rate sensitive liabilities. If the balance sheet is well-matched, a change in
interest rates will have little or no impact on margin, because assets and
liabilities re-price at the same time. The periodic measurement of interest
rate risk exposure will quantify the extent of balance sheet mismatch.
Balance sheet mismatches can be corrected through the use of traditional
portfolio manipulation techniques. Alternatively, financial derivative
instruments can be put into place to hedge against cash flow mismatches.
Conclusion
The commercial banks have emerged as one of the major financial
intermediaries in the country to mobilize the community’s financial
savings. Sustained efforts have been made by commercial banks to induce
people to keep a part of their savings as bank deposits. Deposits mobilized
by the banks are utilized for:
87Notes
(i)
Loans and advances,
(ii) Investments in government and other approved securities in
fulfillment of the liquidity stipulations,
(iii) Investment in commercial papers, shares, debentures, etc. up to a
stipulated ceiling. Reserve Bank of India has instructed the banks
to adopt the realized system of accounting and not the accrued
system. It means that when a loan is sanctioned, it has to be repaid
in time along with interest. In case of failure, it becomes a non
performing asset (NPA) and the bank will have to make provisions
from out of its profit for such NPAs. Since the balance sheet is based
on realized system, banks cannot resort to window dressing of their
balance sheet. Thus, we find that the new format of balance sheet
has changed the attitude of banks towards their asset portfolio.

Introduction
A negotiable instrument is used as a medium of payment in all
business transactions. The Negotiable Instruments Act was enacted, in
India, in 1881.Prior to its enactment, the provision of the English Negotiable
Instrument Act were applicable in India, and the present Act is also based
on the English Act with certain modifications. It extends to the whole of
India except the State of Jammu and Kashmir. The Act operates subject
to the provisions of Sections 31 and 32 of the Reserve Bank of India Act,
1934.Section 31 of the Reserve Bank of India Act provides that no person
in India other than the Bank or as expressly authorized by this Act, the
Central Government shall draw, accept, make or issue any bill of exchange,
hundi, promissory note or engagement for the payment of money payable
to bearer on demand. This Section further provides that no one except
the RBI or the Central Government can make or issue a promissory note
expressed to be payable or demand or after a certain time. Section 32 of
the Reserve Bank of India Act makes issue of such bills or notes punishable
with fine which may extend to the amount of the instrument. The effect or
the consequences of these provisions are:
a) A promissory note cannot be made payable to the bearer, no matter
whether it is payable on demand or after a certain time.
b) A bill of exchange cannot be made payable to the bearer on demand
though it can be made payable to the bearer after a certain time.
89Notes
c) But a cheque {though a bill of exchange} payable to bearer or
demand can be drawn on a person’s account with a banker.
Meaning of Negotiable Instruments
According to Section 13 (a) of the Act, “Negotiable instrument
means a promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque payable either to
order or to bearer, whether the word “order” or “ bearer” appear on the
instrument or not.”In the words of Justice, Willis, “A negotiable instrument
is one, the property in which is acquired by anyone who takes it bona
fide and for value notwithstanding any defects of the title in the person
from whom he took it”. Thus, the term, negotiable instrument means a
written document which creates a right in favour of some person and
which is freely transferable. Although the Act mentions only these three
instruments
(Such as a promissory note, a bill of exchange and cheque), it does
not exclude the possibility of adding any other instrument which satisfies
the following two conditions of negotiability:
a) The instrument should be freely transferable (by delivery or by
endorsement and delivery) by the custom of the trade; and
b) The person who obtains it in good faith and for value should get
it free from all defects, and be entitled to recover the money of the
instrument in his own name.
As such, documents like share warrants payable to bearer, debentures
payable to bearer and dividend warrants are negotiable instruments. But
the money orders and postal orders, deposit receipts, share certificates,
bill of lading, dock warrant, etc. are not negotiable instruments. Although
they are transferable by delivery and endorsements, yet they are not able
to give better title to the bona fide transferee for value than what the
transferor has.
90Notes
Features of a Negotiable Instrument
A negotiable instrument has the following characteristics:
1) Property: The possessor of the negotiable instrument is presumed
to be the owner of the property contained therein. A negotiable
instrument does not merely give possession of the instrument but
right to property also. The property in a negotiable instrument
can be transferred without any formality. In the case of bearer
instrument, the property passes by mere delivery to the transferee.
In the case of an order instrument, endorsement and delivery are
required for the transfer of property.
2. Title: The transferee of a negotiable instrument is known as ‘holder
in due course’. A bona fide transferee for value is not affected by any
defect of title on the part of the transferor or of any of the previous
holders of the instrument.
3. Rights: The transferee of the negotiable instrument can sue in his
own name, in case of dishonour. A negotiable instrument can be
transferred any number of times till it is at maturity. The holder of
the instrument need not give notice of transfer to the party who is
liable to pay on that instrument.
4. Presumptions: Certain presumptions apply to all negotiable
instruments e.g., a presumption that consideration has been paid
under it. It is not necessary to write in a promissory note the words
‘for value received’ or similar expressions because the payment of
consideration is presumed. The words are usually included to create
additional evidence of consideration.
5. Prompt payment: A negotiable instrument enables the holder to
expect prompt payment because a dishonour means the ruin of the
credit of all persons who are parties to the instrument.
Presumptions as to Negotiable Instrument
Sections 118 and 119 of the Negotiable Instrument Act lay down
certain presumptions which the court presumes in regard to negotiable
instruments. In other words, these presumptions need not be proved
as they are presumed to exist in every negotiable instrument. Until the
91Notes
contrary is proved the following presumptions shall be made in case of all
negotiable instruments:
1. Consideration: It shall be presumed that every negotiable instru-
ment was made drawn, accepted or endorsed for consideration. It is
presumed that, consideration is present in every negotiable instru-
ment until the contrary is presumed. The presumption of consid-
eration, however may be rebutted by proof that the instrument had
been obtained from, its lawful owner by means of fraud or undue
influence.
2. Date: Where a negotiable instrument is dated, the presumption is
that it has been made or drawn on such date, unless the contrary is
proved.
3. Time of acceptance: Unless the contrary is proved, every accepted bill
of exchange is presumed to have been accepted within a reasonable
time after its issue and before its maturity. This presumption only
applies when the acceptance is not dated; if the acceptance bears a
date, it will prima facie be taken as evidence of the date on which it
was made.
4. Time of transfer: Unless the contrary is proved it shall be presumed
that every transfer of a negotiable instrument was made before its
maturity.
5. Order of endorsement: Until the contrary is proved it shall be
presumed that the endorsements appearing upon a negotiable
instrument were made in the order in which they appear thereon.
6. Stamp: Unless the contrary is proved, it shall be presumed that a
lost promissory note, bill of exchange or cheque was duly stamped.
7. Holder in due course: Until the contrary is proved, it shall be
presumed that the holder of a negotiable instrument is the holder
in due course. Every holder of a negotiable instrument is presumed
to have paid consideration for it and to have taken it in good faith.
But if the instrument was obtained from its lawful owner by means
of an offence or fraud, the holder has to prove that he is a holder in
due course.
8. Proof of protest: Section 119 lays down that in a suit upon an
instrument which has been dishonoured, the court shall on proof
92Notes
of the protest, presume the fact of dishonour, unless and until such
fact is disproved.
Types of Negotiable Instrument
Section 13, of the ‘Negotiable Instruments Act’ states that a
negotiable instrument is a promissory note, bill of exchange or a cheque
payable either to order or to bearer.
Negotiable instruments ecognized by statute are:
a. Promissory notes
b. Bills of exchange
c. Cheques
Negotiable instruments recognized by usage or custom are Hundis,
Bankers draft, Share warrants, Dividend warrants, Circular notes, Bearer
debentures, Debentures of Bombay Port Trust, Railway receipts and
Delivery orders.
This list of negotiable instrument is not a closed chapter. With the
growth of commerce, new kinds of securities may claim recognition as
negotiable instruments. Let us see the meaning of promissory note, bill of
exchange, cheque and hundi.
1. Promissory notes: Section 4 of the Act defines, “A promissory note
is an instrument in writing (note being a bank-note or a currency
note) containing an unconditional undertaking, signed by the
maker, to pay a certain sum of money to or to the order of a certain
person, or to the bearer of the instruments.” The essential elements
of promissory notes include
a) It must be in writing;
b) It must certainly an express promise or clear understanding to
pay;
c) Promise to pay must be unconditional;
d) It should be signed by the maker;
e) The maker must be certain;
93Notes
f) The payee must be certain;
g) The promise should be to pay money and money only;
h) The amount should be certain; and
i) Other formalities regarding number, place, date, consideration
etc. though usually found given in the promissory notes but are
not essential in law.
2. Bill of exchange: Section 5 of the Act defines, “A bill of exchange
is an instrument in writing containing an unconditional order,
signed by the maker, directing a certain person to pay a certain
sum of money only to, or to the order of a certain person or to the
bearer of the instrument”. A bill of exchange, therefore, is a written
acknowledgement of the debt, written by the creditor and accepted
by the debtor. There are usually three parties to a bill of exchange
drawer, acceptor or drawee and payee. Drawer himself may be the
payee. For example: If A sells goods to B on credit basis for ` 1000
and draws a bill on B. If B accepts the bill, then it becomes the
liability for B to pay the agreed sum within the stipulated time. The
essential conditions of a bill of exchange include
a) It must be in writing;
b) It must be signed by the drawer;
c) The drawer, drawee and payee must be certain;
d) The sum payable must also be certain;
e) It should be properly stamped;
f) It must contain an express order to pay money and money alone;
g) The order must be unconditional.
3. Cheques: Section 6 of the Act defines “A cheque is a bill of exchange
drawn on a specified banker, and not expressed to be payable
otherwise than on demand”. A cheque is bill of exchange with two
more qualifications, namely, (i) it is always drawn on a specified
banker, and (ii) it is always payable on demand. Consequently, all
cheques are bill of exchange, but all bills are not cheque. A cheque
must satisfy all the requirements of a bill of exchange; that is, it
must be signed by the drawer, and must contain an unconditional
order on a specified banker to pay a certain sum of money to or to
the order of a certain person or to the bearer of the cheque. It does
not require acceptance.
94Notes
4. Hundis: A “Hundi” is a negotiable instrument written in an oriental
language. The term hundi includes all indigenous negotiable
instrument whether they be in the form of notes or bills. The
word ‘hundi’ is said to be derived from the Sanskrit word ‘hundi’,
which means “to collect”. They are quite popular among the Indian
merchants from very old days. They are used to finance trade and
commerce and served as easy and sound medium of currency and
credit. Hundis are governed by the custom and usage of the locality
in which they are intended to be used and not by the provision of
the Negotiable Instruments Act. In case there is no customary rule
known as to a certain point, the court may apply the provisions
of the Negotiable Instruments Act. It is also open to the parties to
expressly exclude the applicability of any custom relating to hundis
by agreement.
5. Bankers draft: A draft payable by a bank in cash on presentation.
6. Share warrant: A certificate, usually issued along with a bond or
preferred stock, entitling the holder to buy a specific amount of
securities at a specific price, usually above the current market price
at the time of issuance, for an extended period, anywhere from a
few years to forever. In the case that the price of the security rises to
above that of the warrant’s exercise price, then the investor can buy
the security at the warrant’s exercise price and resell it for a profit.
Otherwise, the warrant will simply expire or remain unused.
7. Dividend warrant: A cheque which makes payment of a dividend.
8. Circular notes: Similar instruments to “letters of credit.” They
are drawn by resident bankers upon their foreign correspondents,
in favor of persons traveling abroad. The correspondents must
be satisfied of the identity of the applicant, before payment; and
the requisite proof of such identity is usually furnished, upon the
applicant’s producing a letter with his signature, by a comparison of
the signatures.
9. Bearer debentures: Bearer debentures do not show the name of the
owner on the debenture. The holders of the bearer debenture are
entitled to receive interest payment on the due dates.
95Notes
Cheque
According to Section 6 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, a cheque
is defined (see the definition given in the last section). A cheque is a
negotiable instrument which is supplied by a banker to the customer who
opens a savings or current account in a bank.
Parties to a Cheque: The customer who draws the cheque on the
bank is called capital drawer. The bank on whom the cheque is drawn
is called the drawee. The person who receives payment on the cheque is
called the payee. Thus, there are three parties to a cheque.
1. Drawer. He is the person who draws the cheque, i.e., the depositor
of money in the bank.
2. Drawee. It is the drawer’s banker on whom the cheque has been
drawn.
3. Payee. He is the person who is entitled to receive the payment of
the cheque.
A savings account holder may have an account with cheque or
without cheque facility. But all the current account holders will be provided
a cheque book. A cheque is a printed leaf supplied by the banker and it
consists of a book of 10 or 20 printed leaves. In the modern days, in all the
metropolitan cities the cheques supplied by the bank to the customer are
called MICR Cheques i.e., Magnetic Ink Character Recognition.
This means that cheque contains a white patch at the bottom
in which numbers are given in magnetic form which represents not
only the number of the cheque but also the code number of branch and
bank. To facilitate mechanical sorting the code line contains the following
numbers:
➢ ➢ 
The first 6 numbers signify the cheque number.
➢ ➢ 
The second 3 numbers signify the city code.
➢ ➢ 
The third 3 numbers signify the bank code.
➢ ➢ 
The fourth 3 numbers signify the branch code of the bank.
96Notes
Features of a Cheque
Following are the features of a cheque:
1. It is an instrument in writing.
2. A cheque is to be drawn only on the branch in which the customer
is maintaining an account.
3. Before drawing a cheque, the customer must have sufficient funds
in his account or else, the cheque will be dishonoured.
4. A cheque is an order by the customer on the bank and so the cheque
must be very clear in the instructions given to the banker.
5. As the cheque is meant for payment of money, the amount mentioned
in the cheque should be specific and it should be written both in
words and figures. If there is any difference in the amount written
in words and figures, the cheque will be dishonoured.
6. A cheque is payable to a specific person. This may be an individual
or a firm or a body corporate that have an account in the bank.
At the same time, to receive payment on cheque, an individual on
whom the cheque is drawn need not have an account. But when the
cheque is given to an individual is crossed, he must have an account
in the bank or else he cannot receive payment.
7. A cheque is payable either to order or bearer. An order cheque is
one which is payable only to a specific person or to whom so ever
he orders. An order cheque is one which is drawn in the following
manner:
Specimen of a Cheque

Rupees .......................................................
`
S. B. A/c No.
“202460” 6000530 17’: 10
97Notes
In the above cheque format the word or bearer will be struck in
the case of an order cheque. For example, ‘Pay to Y’ or bearer, when the
word or bearer is struck, it becomes an order cheque payable only to Y or
whom so ever he orders. When Y wants to transfer, he will have to endorse
the cheque by signing on the back side of the cheque and deliver it to the
transferee. But when it is a bearer cheque, Y can simply hand over the
cheque to any party to whom he wants to transfer. In the case of a bearer
cheque, the word or bearer will not be cancelled.
Whether a cheque is a bearer cheque or order cheque, it depends
on the intention of the drawer of a cheque. If it is a bearer cheque, it will
remain a bearer cheque once for all. On the other hand, when a cheque is
converted into order cheque by cancelling the order or bearer, the cheque
will permanently remain as an order cheque. Here again once an order
cheque will remain an order cheque forever.
8. Signature is an important aspect in a cheque. A cheque should be
signed by the customer and the signature in the cheque should be as
per the specimen signature given by the account holder at the time
of opening the account. In case, a customer adopts a different style
of signature, he must furnish to the bank, a set of fresh specimen
signatures and cancel the old specimen signature.
9. Date appearing on the cheque is a date on which the cheque is
said to have been issued. A banker will make payment on a cheque
either on the date of the cheque or subsequently but not before the
date. A post-dated cheque will never be honoured by the bank. Date
also decides the valid period of the cheque, which is normally six
months.
10. The number appearing on the cheque at the bottom represents the
cheque number and code number of the bank. When the cheque is
presented in the clearing house the computer decodes the cheque
and by this the name of the bank, the branch and the cheque number
with the amount is available which will be prepared in a statement,
when banks take the cheque to the clearing house for realization.
11. Endorsements are done when an order cheque is transferred and the
endorsements appearing on the cheque mention clearly the manner
in which the cheque is transferred from one person to another.
98Notes
According to Sections 118 and 119 of the Negotiable Instruments
Act, endorsement should appear in the same sequence in which the
cheque is transferred from one person to another. This enables the
banker to find out as to who is liable in case of dishonour.
Crossing of a Cheque
Definition of Crossing
Section 123 to 131 (A) of the Negotiable Instruments Act deal about
crossing of a cheque. There are two types of crossing. They are (1) General
crossing and (2) Special crossing. Section 123 defines general crossing of
cheque while Section 124 defines special crossing.
General Crossing: According to Section 123 “where a cheque bears
across its face an addition of the words ‘And Company’ or any abbreviation
thereof, between two parallel transverse lines, or two parallel transverse
lines simply, either with or without the words “Not Negotiable” that
addition shall be deemed a crossing, and the cheque shall be deemed to be
crossed generally”.
Special Crossing: According to Section 124 “where a cheque bears
across in face an addition of the name of the banker, either with or without
the words ‘Not Negotiable’, that addition shall be deemed a crossing and
the cheque shall be deemed to be crossed specially and to be crossed to
that banker”.
Introduction of Crossing
Crossing of cheques is introduced in the beginning of 20 th century
as banks in England were experiencing pilferage of cheques when they
were being taken in coaches to the Central Bank for clearance. To prevent
such pilferage, cheques were crossed after which the missing cheques could
be easily traced as the crossed cheques could be encashed only through an
account. Thus, the introduction of crossing had not only prevented stealing
of cheques but had also enabled the bank to find out which account holder
had received the cheque and received a payment.
99Notes
Who can Cross a Cheque?
A cheque can be crossed by four persons:
1. Drawer: When a drawer issues a cheque to a party, he will cross the
cheque either generally or specially.
2. Holder: When a cheque is given to the holder by the drawer without
crossing, the holder can cross the cheque. But, if the cheque is
already crossed and crossed generally, the holder can convert it
into special crossing. But, a cheque crossed specially cannot be
converted into general crossing.
3. Holder in due course: A holder in due course can also cross the
cheque provided the cheque is not crossed or crossed generally.
When a holder in due course receives an open cheque, he can cross
the cheque generally, it can be converted into special crossing. But
he cannot convert special crossing onto general crossing.
4. Banker: A banker can cross a cheque when he receives it for
collection. A collecting banker normally accepts a crossed cheque
on behalf of the customer for the purpose of collection. But when
the collecting banker receives an open cheque without any crossing,
the banker himself will cross the cheque before sending it for
collection.
What Constitutes Crossing of a Cheque?
When a cheque is crossed across the face with two transverse
parallel lines, it is said to be crossed. In between the two parallel lines, the
cheque will contain words such as ‘And Company’ or an abbreviation as ‘&
Co.’, such cheque is said to be crossed generally.
When a cheque is crossed it implies two things:
(1) Payment will not be made across the counter by a bank when a
crossed cheque is presented.
(2) The crossed cheque will have to be presented in an account through
a pay-in-slip.
100Notes
If a banker makes the payment of a crossed cheque across the
counter, it is a gross violation of payment in due course. When a cheque
goes to an account, it will be credited and the amount can be withdrawn
only by a separate cheque. In General crossing, the cheque will bear across
the two parallel transverse lines, 2 types of words. These are:
(1) Not Negotiable
(2) Account Payee.
(1)  Not Negotiable crossing: When a cheque bears across its face
two transverse parallel lines with the words not negotiable, it is a
clear indication to the banker that the bank has to be very careful
while making the payment on the cheque. Not negotiable takes
away the character of negotiability on a cheque. It means that if
there is any defect in the cheque, it will affect the transferee, even
if the transferee is a holder in due course. Thus, not negotiable
crossing is a forewarning given to all the transferees of the cheque
that they should be careful while receiving the cheque even if they
happened to be a holder in due course. In real life we come across
‘Not Negotiable’ crossing when companies are sending dividend
warrants to their shareholders. When lakhs of shareholders
are receiving cheques, it can be altered, or the payees’ names
can be changed without the knowledge of the bank. If a banker,
overlooking this alteration, credits the account of the customer, it
is the bank that will be liable and not the drawer company. Hence,
a ‘Not Negotiable’ crossing gives caution to the banker and the
bank has to take utmost precaution while making payment on the
cheque containing not negotiable crossing. Otherwise, the banker
will be held liable for negligence. A bank cannot claim protection
even as a holder in due course.
(2) 
Account Payee crossing: Though Not Negotiable crossing
is mentioned nowhere in the Section 130 of the Negotiable
Instruments Act, account payee crossing is mentioned. This means
that account payee crossing is not legally permitted under the
Negotiable Instruments Act. The reason is that when a cheque
is crossed account payee only, payment should be credited by the
bank only to the account of the payee. An example is given below:
101Notes
Pay to X
This means that the bank has to credit the account of X only and
the cheque is not transferable to any other person. This goes against
the principle of negotiability and transferability. Hence, the Negotiable
Instruments Act has not recognized the account payee crossing but by
custom a banker allows the account payee crossing and so the courts have
agreed such crossing by custom and not by statute.
The following diagrams show general crossing and special crossing
Special Crossing: Section 124 defines special crossing wherein
the cheque will contain the name of another bank in the crossing. Special
crossing does not require two parallel transverse lines. It may or may not
exist.

“202460” 6000530 17’: 10
This cheque is said to be crossed specially. In this cheque, State
Bank of India is the paying banker and Indian Bank is the collecting
banker. When the cheque is presented in the clearing house, State Bank of
India should pay on this cheque only to Indian Bank which presents it. If
any other bank presents this cheque, State Bank of India should not pay.
Thus, a clear instruction is given by the drawer of the cheque or any other
holder that payment should be made through Indian Bank.
The above cheque can also be drawn with the name of Indian Bank
appearing along with words Account Payee only. In such a case, State Bank
of India will pay to the Indian Bank which will be crediting account of the
payee in whose name the cheque is drawn. The cheque is not transferable
to any other person. Similarly, along with the Indian Bank name in the
special crossing, there may be words such as ‘not negotiable’. This again is
an indication that the paying banker State Bank of India should be careful
so also the collecting banker, Indian Bank. It should take more precautions
while crediting the account of the customer. Unless the customer presenting
the cheque is a genuine person, the cheque with the words not negotiable
cannot be credited.
Double Special Crossing or Double Crossing: Normally in a
special crossing, the paying banker will pay only to that bank whose name
is appearing in that crossing. But sometimes, the bank whose name is
appearing in the crossing may not find a branch in the place where the
payee is to present the cheque. For example, a cheque belonging to Indian
Bank with a crossing of Bank of Tamil Nadu is sent to a person in Punjab.
Since, the Bank of Tamil Nadu does not have a branch in Punjab, Indian
Bank at Punjab will find it difficult to pay on the cheque. Hence, Bank of
Tamil Nadu will appoint Punjab National Bank as its agent for collection.
Now the crossing will appear as below:
103Notes
Bank of Tamil Nadu
to
Punjab National Bank
as agent for collection
If in this crossing, the word as agent for collection is not there,
Indian Bank which is a paying banker will refuse to pay on the cheque
according to Section 127 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. Thus, a paying
banker will have to be careful and the collecting banker also must write
the words as agent for collection, failing which he cannot receive payment
of the cheque.
Liability of a Paying Banker on a Crossed Cheque
A paying banker has to be careful while making payment on a
crossed cheque. Especially, when the crossing contains certain special
instructions such as account payee or not negotiable. Under Section 126
of the Negotiable Instruments Act, the paying banker has to pay only
to that banker whose name is appearing in the crossing of the cheque.
Otherwise, the paying banker will be liable.
According to Section
124, the paying banker has to strictly observe the crossing on the cheque
as per the instructions given in the crossing. A paying banker is liable to
two parties when he fails to observe the crossing.
(1) Liable to true owner: When a cheque is drawn in the name of X
and crossed account payee only, it is the duty of the paying banker
to pay or credit the account of X failing which the owner of the
cheque can sue the paying banker. The paying banker should also
be careful when the cheque contains crossing as not negotiable. If
due care is not taken, the paying banker commits the mistake of
negligence. Now the paying banker will be liable to the true owner
not only for the amount of the cheque but also for any damages for
refusal to pay.
(2) To the Drawer: The paying banker is liable to the drawer for not
complying with instruction as given in the cheque. It is not only
making payment to an account but payment as per the instructions
in the crossing is also a must. So, when there is a violation and when
the paying banker has not observed the instruction given in the
104Notes
crossing, the drawer will make the paying banker liable and can also
claim damages. The paying banker also looses statutory protection.
Lifting of crossing or Opening of Crossing: A cheque containing
a crossing is called a crossed cheque. But when the crossing in the cheque
is cancelled by the drawer by himself with his full signature at the place of
cancellation in the cheque, then the cheque becomes an open cheque, in
which case, the banker can make payment across the counter. Other than
drawer, no other person is authorized to lift the crossing.
Obliterating of crossing: When the crossing in the cheque is erased
deliberately by persons other than the drawer to defraud the drawer or the
drawee, and the banker without looking at such erasing of crossing makes
payments on the cheque, the banker is set to have committed the mistake
of violating Section 10 i.e., payment in due course. The paying banker can
claim protection in the case of obliterating of crossing provided he has
made payment but strictly adhering to payment in due course. In other
words, the banker could not find out the obliterating of crossing even after
a careful scrutiny of the cheque.
Endorsement of Cheque
Transfer of negotiable instruments: Negotiable instruments are
those which can be transferred from one person to another either by mere
delivery, if it is a bearer instrument or by endorsement and delivery if it is
an order instrument. By such a transfer, the transferee becomes the owner
of the instrument according to Section 14 of the negotiable instrument act.
In the normal day to day life, we normally do not come across endorsement,
as most of us have only savings account.
Endorsement is applicable only to an order instrument and is
accepted only in current account. In savings account, only cheques drawn
in the name of the account holder are accepted and no third party cheques
will be accepted by the bank. Whereas in the current account, third party
cheques are accepted and an order cheque drawn in the name of a third
party can be deposited when the third party endorses the cheque in favor
of the account holder and delivers the same.
105Notes
An order cheque is written by cancelling the words “or bearer” in
the cheque by the drawer at the time of issuing it. If a cheque is drawn in
the name of Mr. X, and as an order cheque, Mr. X will have to endorse if he
wants to transfer it to Y. This means X will have to sign on the reverse side
of the cheque and handover the same to Y. This is called blank endorsement.
Mr. X can also write on the reverse side as ‘Pay to Y’ and sign. This is full
endorsement. Mr. X, who endorses the cheque, is called the endorser and
Mr. Y to whom the cheque is endorsed is the endorsee. Thus, there are two
parties to an endorsement – endorser and endorsee. Endorse is the one
who transfers. Endorsee is the transferee.
Thus, an endorsement is a process by which an order instrument
is transferred. An endorsement is said to be complete only when the
instrument is delivered by the endorser to the endorsee. The transfer
may be physical or constructive. When an endorser after endorsing the
negotiable instrument, hands over to the endorsee, it is called physical
transfer. If the endorser after endorsing the instrument, informs the
endorsee either by phone or through any person and asks the endorsee to
collect the instrument it is called constructive delivery.
Endorsement is defined under Section 15 of the Negotiable
Instrument Act as “When the maker or holder of a negotiable instrument
signs the same, otherwise than as such maker, for the purpose of negotiation,
on the back or face thereof or on a slip of paper annexed thereto or so
signs for the same purpose a stamped paper intended to be completed as a
negotiable instrument, he is said to have endorsed the same and is called
the endorser”.
Legal Effects of the Transfer by Endorsement
(a) Transfer of ownership: When a negotiable instrument is endorsed
and delivered, the endorsee not only becomes absolute owner but
also has the right to further transfer the instrument by endorsement.
Even if the legal relationship existing prior to endorsement gets
terminated, it will not affect the transfer of ownership under
endorsement. If the relationship between a principal and agent
gets terminated after the principal endorsing the instrument to the
agent, the effects of endorsement remain, by the agent becoming
the owner of the instrument. The termination of legal relationship
106Notes
will not affect the transfer and so the drawee of the instrument is
liable to the agent and cannot escape the liability. If the principal
dies, the agent will have the right on the instrument and the agent
can further endorse the instrument or encash the instrument by
presenting it on the due date with the drawee.
(b) Presumption under Section 118: The order or sequence in which
the instrument is transferred, in the same order, the endorsement
should appear on the reverse side of the instrument. Thus, when the
instrument is dishonoured by the drawee it is easy for the endorsee
to know his previous endorser and can fix the liability. Section 118
presumes that the instrument is transferred in the same order in
which the endorsement is appearing on the instrument.
(c) Joint endorsement: When an instrument is held jointly, all the
joint owners have to endorse the instrument. Similarly, when an
instrument is endorsed in favour of more than one person, all the
endorsees will sign when they further endorse the instrument.
(d) Endorsement for full amount: When an instrument is endorsed
in favour of an endorsee, the entire amount in the instrument is
transferred in the favour of the endorsee. Part endorsement in favour
of different parties is not allowed. The legal effect of endorsement
completely transfers the ownership in favour of endorsee and not
partly in favour of endorsee.
(e) Endorsement within stipulate time: The endorsement of a
negotiable instrument must be done and received by the endorsee
within the time limit or maturity of the instrument. A cheque must
be endorsed and delivered within six months from the date of the
cheque or else the endorsement will become ineffective.
(f) Endorsement to be followed by delivery: An endorsement is said
to be complete only when it is followed by delivery. The endorser
after the endorsement may physically deliver the instrument to the
endorsee or he may inform the endorsee to collect the instrument
endorsed in his favour, which is constructive delivery. If an endorser
after the endorsement and before delivery dies, the endorsement
is not complete and the endorsee cannot claim the ownership.
Even the legal heirs of the deceased cannot deliver in favour of the
endorsee.
107Notes
Rules Pertaining to Endorsement
(1) Allonge: When an instrument is endorsed, if there is no more
space for further endorsement, a paper will be attached with the
instrument for further endorsement. This paper is called allonge.
When an allonge is attached, the last endorsement appearing on
the instrument will once again appear as the first endorsement in
the allonge. This procedure is adopted for avoiding any mix up of
allonges with various other instruments.
(2) Signature: An endorsement is complete only when it is endorsed by
the owner of the instrument or any of his authorized agents, who is
allowed to endorse on his behalf. If there are more than one person
owning, all of them have to endorse and only then the endorsement
is said to be complete.
(3) Correct initial and Name: The endorser should be sign the
instrument in the same spelling and initial and then give the correct
name and initial. For example, if a cheque is endorsed for Ramoo
and then given below his correct spelling as Ramu. The same applies
to wrong initial also.
(4) Endorsement by
(a) 
Married Woman: When a cheque is drawn in favour of Mrs.
Kannan. Now when MTrs. Kannan endorses, she will have to
sign as Lata Kannan and the endorsement will appear as
Sindhu Ramesh
(Wife of Mr. Ramesh)
That is, the christened name will appear first followed by her
husband’s name.
In the case of unmarried woman, if a cheque is drawn in favour
of Miss. Raman, she will endorse in her christened name followed by her
father’s name.
Gayathri Sarvesh
(daughter of Mr. Sarvesh)
108Notes
(b) 
Illiterate person: When a cheque is drawn in favour of
illiterate person, and when he wants to endorse, his thumb
impression will have to be affixed and it should be followed by
the signature and address of the witness.
(c) 
Partnership firm: When a partnership firm is endorsing a
cheque, it should be signed by the partner who is authorized
by the firm to endorse.
M/s. Hanshika Sarvesh & Sons
Sadhanaa
Partner
(d) 
Company: When a company is endorsing a cheque, it should
be done by persons who are authorized to do so as per the
resolutions of the board of directors of the company. The
endorsements will appear as
For HANSHIKA COMPANY LIMITED
SARVESH
(Director)
(e) 
Institution: In the case of institution, the endorsement will
appear as
For AKSHAJ TECHNOLOGICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE
RISHIK
(Chairman)
(f) 
Liquidator: When a company is in the process of winding
up, a liquidator will be appointed and he alone has the power
to endorse the cheques belonging to the company. The
endorsement will appear as
For JAIPUR COMPANY LIMITED in liquidation
KARUN
(Liquidator)
(g) 
E xecutor or Administrator: An executor is one who is
appointed by a will and on the death of the person who has
written the will, the executor has to implement the will. For
this purpose the executor will have to probate the will through
109Notes
the court. After this, any cheque belonging to the deceased
will be endorsed as
ANBU
(Executor of Late Ranganathan)
Administrator is one who is appointed by the court in the absence
of executor and he will endorse as
DAMAL SINGH
(Administrator of Late Sitalakshmi)
(h) 
Trustee: When a cheque is endorsed by a trustee, he will
sign as
HIMESH
(Trustee of Krishna Temple)
(i) 
Power of Attorney: This is like an agent and when the power of
attorney endorses a cheque drawn in the name of his principal,
he will endorse as
For (or on behalf of or perpro) Prabhakar
Mukesh
(Power of Attorney)
(5) Prefix and Suffix: A cheque may be drawn with a prefix Mr. or Mrs.
And may also have suffix with qualifications. Example: Pay to Mr.
Raja, M.Com., B.Ed., Mr is a prefix and M.Com.,. B.Ed. is suffix and
when endorsement is made by Raja, only his name alone should be
there without any prefix and suffix.
(6) Defence personnel: When cheques are drawn in the name of persons
working in army, navy or air force, the cheque will be drawn along
with their rank. Example: Pay to Major Vijay. Now this cheque will
be endorsed by Major Vijay as
Vijay
Maj.
110Notes
Kinds of Endorsements
(1) Blank endorsement: When an endorsement is made on the reverse
side of the instrument with a mere signature of the endorser without
any name or any other remark, it is called blank endorsement.
(2) Full endorsement: When the endorser writes the name of the
endorsee on the reverse side of the instrument such as: Pay to Raju
or order *(Sd) Krish. Here, the endorser is Krish and the endorsee
is Raju. Thus, the full endorsement is complete in all respects.
(3) Conditional Endorsement: Where an endorsement is made with a
specific condition to be fulfilled by the endorsee for acquiring the
ownership right on the instrument, it is conditional endorsement.
Example: Pay to Raju on delivery of bill of lading. (Sd) Krish. Raju
will be given instrument or the amount on the instrument only
when he delivers bill of lading.
(4) Restrictive endorsement: Here, the endorser takes away the right of
the endorsee for further endorsement of the instrument. Example:
Pay to Raju only. (Sd)Krishnan. Now this type of endorsement
restricts further transfer of the instrument. This takes away the
fundamental character of negotiable instrument, which is one of
transferability.
(5) Sans-recourse endorsement: When the endorser informs the
endorsee that in case of the dishonour of the instrument, the
endorsee cannot make the endorser liable, the endorsee can only
catch hold of any other party on the instrument but not the endorser.
Example: Pay to Raju Sans-recourse. (Sd) Krishnan. Here, in case of
dishonour of the instrument, Krish cannot be held liable as he has
endorsed the instrument Sans-recourse is stop taking action.
(6) Sans-frais endorsement: When the endorser informs the endorsee
that any expenses incurred in receiving payment on the instrument
should not be debited to the account of the endorser.
(7) Facultative endorsement: When the endorser excuses the endorsee
from performing any duty in the case of dishonour. Example: Pay
to Raju. Notice of dishonour waived.
(Sd) Krishnan. From
this endorsement, the endorser does not escape his liability in case
of dishonour of the instrument.

Developments in Collection and Payment of Cheques - Cheque
Truncation System (CTS)
Cheque Truncation
Truncation is the process of stopping the flow of the physical cheque
issued by a drawer to the drawee branch. The physical instrument will be
truncated at some point en-route to the drawee branch and an electronic
image of the cheque would be sent to the drawee branch along with the
relevant information like the MICR fields, date of presentation, presenting
banks etc. Thus, with the implementation of cheque truncation, the need
to move the physical instruments across branches would not be required,
except in exceptional circumstances. This would effectively reduce the
time required for payment of cheques, the associated cost of transit and
delay in processing, etc., thus speeding up the process of collection or
realization of the cheques.
Need for Cheque Truncation in India
Cheque Truncation speeds up collection of cheques and therefore
enhances customer service, reduces the scope for clearing related frauds,
minimizes cost of collection of cheques, reduces reconciliation problems,
eliminates logistics problems etc. With the other major product offering
in the form of RTGS, the Reserve Bank created the capability to enable
inter-bank payments online real time and facilitate corporate customer
payments. The other product, National Electronic Funds Transfer, is an
electronic credit transfer system.
However, to wish away cheques is simply not possible and that is the
reason why the Bank decided to focus on improving the efficiency of the
Cheque Clearing Cycle. Cheque Truncation is the alternative. Moreover
contrary to perceptions, Cheque Truncation is a more secure system than
the current exchange of physical documents in which the cheque moves
from one point to another, thus, not only creating delays but inconvenience
to the customer in case the instrument is lost in transit or manipulated
during the clearing cycle. In addition to operational efficiency, Cheque
Truncation has several benefits to the banks and customers which includes
introduction of new products, re-engineering the total receipts and
payments mechanism of the customers, human resource rationalization,
112Notes
cost effectiveness, etc. Cheque Truncation, thus, is an important efficiency
enhancement initiative in the Payments Systems area, undertaken by RBI.
Uniqueness of the Cheque to be Imparted to the Image
The images captured at the presenting bank level would be
transmitted to the Clearing House and then to the drawee branches with
digital signatures of the presenting bank. Thus, each image would carry the
digital signature, apart from the physical endorsement of the presenting
bank, in a prescribed manner. In order to ensure only images of requisite
quality reach the drawee branches, there will be a quality check process at
the level of the Capture Systems and the Clearing House Interface. This
would ensure only images of requisite quality secured with the digital
signatures of the presenting banks reach the drawee branches. In addition,
drawers could consider using holograms, barcoding or such other features,
which would add to the uniqueness of the images.
Implementation of Cheque Truncation Method Proposed by RBI
Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is proposing to implement the project
on a PILOT basis in the National Capital Region (NCR), New Delhi. Based
on the experienced gathered, it would consider extending the coverage to
other centres. In the process of implementation, banks have been given
the freedom to decide the point of truncation. RBI would be installing
an interface with its system (Clearing House Interface - CHI) at the ser-
vice branches of banks, who are members of New-Delhi Bankers Clearing
House. Banks have to decide the point of truncation and have to ensure
that the images are digitally signed after their capture. It would flow there-
after to the interface (CHI) provided by RBI, from where the images would
flow to the clearing House with the digital signatures of the banks. These
digitally signed images would reach the service branches of the drawee
branches clearing house interface. The service branches have to ensure that
these images are moved across their branches to ensure their processing.
Support from RBI to Facilitate Cheque Truncation
RBI’s services include system development and installation at
the clearing house, interfaces at the bank’s end, network, handholding,
awareness propagation and training.
113Notes
Entire Process Flow Envisaged in the CTS
The CTS project envisages a safe, secured, faster and effective sys-
tem for clearing of the cheques. In the CTS, the presenting bank will cap-
ture the data & images of the cheques using their Capture System which
is internal to them. They have to meet the specifications and standards
prescribed for data and images. To ensure security, safety and non-repudi-
ation the PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) is being implemented across the
system. The banks will send the captured images and data to the central
clearing house for onward transmission to the payee/drawee banks. For
that purpose RBI will be providing the banks software called the Clearing
House Interface (CHI) that will enable them to connect and transmit data
in a secure way and with non-repudiation to the Clearing House (CH). The
Clearing House will process the data and arrive at the settlement figure for
the banks and send the required data to payee/drawee banks for processing
at their end. The drawee/payee banks will use the same CHI mentioned
earlier for receiving the data and images from the Clearing House. It will
be the responsibility of the drawee bank Capture System to process the in-
ward data and images and generate the return file for unpaid instruments.
Participants in the Cheque Truncation System
The criteria for banks participating in the Cheque truncation
system are:
(a) Membership of the clearing house in the NCR.
(b) Membership of the Indian Financial Network (INFINET)
Participation by Non-INFINET Member Banks
In respect of banks who are not members of the INFINET, the
following alternatives are available.
(a) 
They may become the sub-members of the direct members
(b) Such banks may use the infrastructure of the other banks having
INFINET membership without being the INFINET members
themselves and their clearing settlement can be done either directly
or through the member through whom they are participating.
114Notes
Infrastructure Requirements for Banks
The infrastructure required for CTS from bank’s end are connec-
tivity from the bank gateway to the clearing house, hardware and software
for the CTS applications. RBI shall be providing member banks with the
CHI and the banks have to procure other hardware and system software
for the CHI and the application software for their capture systems on their
own. The hardware requirement is based on the volume of the cheques
processed by the banks. Based on the volume the CHI is categorized into
four types and the hardware requirement is different for each category.
The band width requirement for each bank is calculated based a number
of factors like the peak inward and outward volume of the bank, average
size of an image, efficiency factor of the network etc. In addition to that,
future requirement have been taken into consideration for calculating the
band with requirement.
Image Specifications in the CTS
Imaging of cheques can be based on various technology options.
The cheque images can be black and white, Grey Scale or coloured. Black
and White images do not reveal all the subtle features that are there in
the cheques. Coloured Images increase storage and network bandwidth
requirements. So it was decided that the electronic images of truncated
cheques will be in gray scale technology. There will be three images of the
cheques i.e. front grey, front black & white and back black & white which
will be made available to member banks.
Ensuring Quality of the Images
As the payments will be made on the basis of the images, it is es-
sential to ensure the quality of the images. For that purpose the solution
proposes Image Quality Audit (IQA) at different level. RBI will be speci-
fying the image standards to the member banks. The presenting bank is
required to perform the quality audit during the capture itself. Further
quality audit will be done at the gateway before onward transmission to
clearing house. Further, the drawee bank can ask for the physical instru-
ment if it is not satisfied that the image quality is not good enough for
payment processing.
115Notes
Security of Image and Data Transmitted Over the Network
The security, integrity, non-repudiation and authenticity of the
data and image transmitted from the paying bank to payee bank will be
ensured using the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). The CTS is compliant
to the requirement of the IT Act, 2000. It has been made mandatory for
the presenting bank to sign the image & data from the point of origin
itself. The image and data are secured using the PKI throughout the entire
cycle covering capture system, the presenting bank, the clearing house
and the drawee bank. The PKI standards used are in accordance with the
appropriate Indian acts and practices of IDRBT which is the certifying
authority for banks & financial institutions in India.
Type of Cheques that can be Presented in the CTS
All the local cheques can be presented in the CTS. Banks may also
present cheques on banks situated outside the NCR, but such banks have
branches in the NCR region. The CTS also supports the intercity clearing
and specialized clearing like high value clearing etc.
Precautions Required to be Taken by the
Bank Customers to Avoid Frauds
Bank customers should use image friendly cheques. They should
preferably use dark coloured ink while drawing the instruments. Care
should be exercised in the use of rubber stamp, so that it would not interfere
with the material portions of the cheque. The date of the cheque, payees
name, amount and signature are the basic features which are essential
in a cheque. The use of rubber stamps, etc, should not overshadow the
clear appearance of these basic features in image. In order to ensure that
all essential elements of a cheque are captured in an image during the
scanning process, bank customers have to exercise appropriate care in this
regard.
Change in the Process for the Customers
There will be no change in the clearing process. Customers would
continue to use cheques as at present, except in the use of image friendly
coloured ink for making the instruments. Of course, such of those
116Notes
customers, who used to receive the paid instruments, like Government
Departments, would only receive cheque images instead of the physical
instruments. This will also facilitate in better processing at their end, as
they will be able to access online images in addition to the data.
As the images are going to be moved across, the time taken for the
receipt of paid instruments at their end could be reduced so that better
and timely control could be exercised over payments. This will also give an
early opportunity to the drawers or issuers of cheques to detect frauds or
alterations in their cheques. It is also possible for cheque issuers to consider
newer techniques such as embedded verifiable features such as bar-codes
or logos or watermarks, encrypted codes, holograms, etc., which would
facilitate early interception of altered/forged instruments.
Benefit of Cheque Truncation to Customers of Banks
Before we answer this question, we have to understand the present
system of cheque clearance. The cheques presented by customers, today,
are sent to the clearing house at the drawee centres by the beneficiaries’
bank. The cheques at the bigger cities, in view of the large volume of paper
instruments, are subjected encoding and then to mechanical sorting and
thereafter reach the drawee branches.
As per the existing banking practice, these instruments received
at the counters of the drawee branches are paid or returned by them. The
returned instruments are passed on to the presenting customers through
the process of a return clearing. Only after the return clearing process
gets over, banks release the credit to the customers. The beneficiaries’
account gets credited on the same day on which the drawees’ account gets
debited; however, the beneficiary is permitted to use the proceeds only
after the return clearing process. With the introduction of the imaging
and truncation, the physical movement of instruments would be stopped
and the electronic movement of images of cheques would speed up the
process of settlements and ultimately alter the clearing cycles. The clearing
cycle could be shortened and it would be possible for customers to realize
the proceeds of cheques early. Thus, cheque truncation would reduce
effectively the time of float, i.e. time from the point of issue of cheque
to the point of time the actual debit takes place. In case such clearing is
introduced across the cities, it would ensure the realization of inter-city
117Notes
instruments faster thus ensuring early availability of funds to beneficiaries.
Thus the benefits could be summarized as:
a) 
Faster clearing cycle;
b) 
B etter reconciliation/verification process
c) 
B etter Customer Service and Enhanced Customer Window
d) 
T+0 for Local Clearing and T + 1 for inter-city clearing.
e) 
Elimination of Float and Incentive to shift to Credit Push payments.
f) 
The jurisdiction of Clearing House can be extended to the entire
country.
h) 
No Geographical Dependence
g) 
Operational Efficiency will benefit the bottom lines of banks and
Local Clearing activity is a high cost no revenue activity.
h) 
Minimizes Transaction Costs.
i) 
Reduces operational risk by securing the transmission route.
What is an Image Replacement Document (IRD)?
Under CTS, after the capture of the image, the physical cheque
would be warehoused with the presenting bank. In case the beneficiary
or any other connected persons require the instrument, the payee bank
could issue a copy of the image, under its authentication, which is called
Image Replacement document. It is a legally recognized replacement of
the original cheque for re-presentment. The provisions of Negotiable
Instruments Act [Section 81(3)of the NI Act as amended] also permit the
usage of such IRD. The physical instruments are required to be stored for a
statutory period. It would be obligatory for presenting bank to warehouse
the physical instruments for that statutory period. In case a customer
desires to get a paper instrument back, the instrument can be sourced
from the presenting bank through the drawee bank.
Conclusion
Cheque is a negotiable instrument used as a medium of payment
in all business transactions. There is lot of developments that took place
in the banking services due to the advances in telecommunication and
information technology. Cheque truncation service is one such example.

Evolution of Central Banking System
Global Evolution of Central Banking
Evolution of central banking is essentially a twentieth century
phenomenon as there were only about a dozen central banks in the world
at the turn of the twentieth century. In contrast, at present there are nearly
160 central banks. This is not surprising since the need for central banks
obviously emerged, as banking became more complex, while becoming
an increasingly important part of the economy over time. Many problems
experienced by banks and their depositors inevitably led to cries for their
regulation. Second, central banks are essentially a nation’s phenomenon.
Third, it is useful to recall some of the reasons for the origin of central
banks: to issue currency; to be a banker and lender to the government: to
regulate and supervise the banks and financial entities: and to serve as a
lender-of-last-resort.
The new objective function assigned to the central bank is to focus
on price stability, with financial stability as an additional objective in
some cases. Two pertinent questions recently being raised relating to the
independence of the central bank include: First, why is it so obvious that
central banks should abandon their ‘parents’, the sovereign government?
One quick explanation could be that the central banks have ‘come-of-age’
in recent years. But then, some instances like the case of two currencies
in Iraq in the 1990s and that of the Bank of Japan in recent years provide
a contrary view to the ‘come-of-age’ hypothesis. Second, is it really the
case that supervision and regulation of banks by the central bank leads to
conflict of interest? In consideration of this conflict, the Financial Services
Authority was established in the UK in 2000, and a number of countries
have followed suit. In India, we have Financial Stability and Development
Council.
The Genesis of Central Banking in India
In 1926, the Royal Commission on Indian Currency and Finance
(Hilton Young Commission) recommended that dichotomy of functions
and division of responsibilities for control of currency and credit should be
ended. The Commission suggested the establishment of a central bank to be
called the Reserve Bank of India, whose separate existence was considered
necessary for augmenting banking facilities throughout the country. The
124Notes
Bill to establish the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) was introduced in January
1927 in the Legislative Assembly, but it was dropped due to differences
in views regarding ownership, constitution and composition of its Board
of Directors. The White Paper on Indian Constitutional Reforms (1933)
proposed the setting up of the RBI free from political influences. The
Indian Central Banking Enquiry Committee (1931) had also strongly
recommended the establishment of a Reserve Bank. These events led to
the introduction of a fresh Bill in 1933. The Bill was passed in 1934 and
the RBI Act came into force on January 1, 1935. The Reserve Bank was
inaugurated on April 1, 1935.
Central banks occupy a pivotal position in the institutional fabric
of an economy. The functions of a modern central bank are vastly different
from what was expected from the early central banks founded in Europe
in the seventeenth century. The evolution of central banking in the Indian
context has its own specificity. The RBI, while discharging its statutory
responsibilities, has played a crucial role in the nation building process,
particularly in the development of the financial sector. In fact, institution
building constitutes a distinguishing feature of central banking in India.
This following section describes the evolution of central banking in
India over the period of seventy years since the inception of the Reserve
Bank in 1935. For analytical convenience, the entire period 1935-2005
is sub-divided into three broad phases: foundation phase (1935-1950),
development phase (1951-1990) and reform phase (1991 onwards).
a) 
Foundation Phase (1935-50): During most of the formation phase
it was a private bank, though formed under a statute and overseen
by the then colonial government. The functions of the Bank during
this phase were confined essentially to traditional central banking,
i.e., note issue authority and banker to the Government. During
the war and post war years, its major preoccupation was facilitation
of war finance, repatriation of sterling debt and planning and
administration of exchange control. Upon the nationalization of
the Bank in 1949 in terms of the Reserve Bank of India (Transfer
to Public Ownership) Act, 1948 and the enactment of the Banking
Regulation Act, 1949, regulation and supervision of banks received
the focus. On the initiative of the Reserve Bank, the Government
appointed the Rural Banking Enquiry Committee in1949 to consider
important policy issues relating to the extension of banking facilities
in the country.
125Notes
b) 
Development Phase (1951-1990): With the launching of five-year
plans, the Bank’s functions became more diversified in terms of Plan
financing and establishment of specialized institutions to promote
savings and investment in the Indian economy and meet the
credit requirements of the priority sectors. Two important events
during the 1960s – the devaluation of the rupee in June 1966 and
nationalization of 14 private commercial banks in July 1969 – greatly
influenced the functions of the Reserve Bank in the subsequent
years. Externally, the uncertainties in the global economy following
the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system of stable exchange
rates and the emergence of the floating regimes exacerbated by
the oil shock of 1973-74 presented serious challenges for exchange
rate management and gave rise to balance of payments difficulties
in India as in many other developing countries. The Government
re-focused on the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA), 1947
for conserving foreign exchange rather than regulating the entry
of foreign capital. The FERA, 1973 was drafted incorporating the
changes necessary for effective implementation of the Government
policy and removing the difficulties in the working of the existing
legislation. The major responsibilities devolving on the Reserve
Bank during the 1970s related to regulation and management of
the country’s scarce foreign exchange reserves and expansion in the
volume and scope of its refinance facilities for agriculture and rural
development. During the 1980s, monetary policy assumed a new
focus. On the whole, the development phase was characterized by a
plethora of controls and regulations in the Indian economy.
c) 
Reform Phase (1991 Onwards): The process of liberalization and
globalization the Indian economy initiated since 1991 added several
new dimensions to the responsibilities of the Reserve Bank. Along
with financial sector reforms, the monetary policy framework has
been fine-tuned and the conventional central banking functions
including those of currency management and payment and
settlement systems have been revamped in tandem with the global
trends and domestic expediency. The reform measures in the
financial sector and the initiatives taken by the Reserve Bank for
developing financial markets to ensure efficient transmission of
monetary policy impulses, constituted the hallmark of this phase.
The first phase of reforms, guided by the recommendations of the
126Notes
Committee on Financial System (Narasimham Committee I), aimed
at enhancing the operational flexibility and functional autonomy of
the financial sector with a view to fostering efficiency, productivity
and profitability. The second phase, based on the recommendations
of the Committee on Banking Sector Reforms (Narasimham
Committee II), focused on strengthening the foundations of the
banking system and bringing about structural improvements.
Organization, Management and Structure of RBI

Functions of RBI
The Reserve Bank is the umbrella network for numerous activities,
all related to the nation’s financial sector, encompassing and extending
beyond the functions of a typical central bank. This section provides an
overview of primary activities of RBI as given below:
1) Monetary Authority
2) Issuer of Currency
3) Banker and Debt Manager to Government
4) Banker to Banks
5) Regulator of the Banking System
6) Manager of Foreign Exchange
7) Regulator and Supervisor of the Payment and Settlement Systems
8) Developmental Role
1) Monetary Authority
Monetary policy refers to the use of instruments under the control
of the central bank to regulate the availability, cost and use of money
and credit. The goal of monetary policy is to achieve specific economic
objectives such as low and stable inflation and promoting growth. The
main objectives of monetary policy in India are:
129Notes
a) 
Maintaining price stability;
b) 
Ensuring adequate flow of credit to the productive sectors of the
economy to support economic growth
c) 
Financial stability.
The relative emphasis among the objectives varies from time to
time, depending on evolving macro economic developments. The operating
framework is based on a multiple indicator approach. This means that RBI
monitors and analyses the movement of a number of indicators including
interest rates, inflation rate, money supply, credit, exchange rate, trade,
capital flows and fiscal position, along with trends in output as it develops
its policy perspectives.
The Reserve Bank’s Monetary Policy Department (MPD) formulates
monetary policy. The Financial Markets Department (FMD) handles day-
to-day liquidity management operations. There are several direct and
indirect instruments that are used in the formulation and implementation
of monetary policy.
Direct Instruments
a) Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR): CRR is the share of net demand and
time liabilities that banks must maintain as cash balance with the
Reserve Bank. This to ensure that banks have sufficient cash to cover
customer withdrawals. This ratio will be adjusted on occasion, as an
instrument of monetary policy, depending on prevailing conditions.
RBI’s centralized and computerized system allows for efficient and
accurate monitoring of the balances maintained by banks with it.
b) Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR): The share of net demand and
time liabilities that banks must maintain in safe and liquid assets,
such as, government securities, cash and gold.
c) Refinance facilities: Sector-specific refinance facilities (e.g., against
lending to export sector) provided to banks.
Indirect Instruments
➢ ➢ 
Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF): Consists of daily infusion
or absorption of liquidity on purchase basis, through repo
130Notes
(liquidity injection) and reverse repo (liquidity absorption) auction
operations, using government securities as collateral.
➢ ➢ 
Open Market Operations (OMO): Outright sales/purchases of
government securities, in addition to LAF, as a tool to determine
the level of liquidity over the medium term.
➢ ➢ 
Market Stabilization Scheme (MSS): This instrument for monetary
management was introduced in 2004. Liquidity of a more enduring
nature arising from large capital flows is absorbed through sale of
short-dated government securities and treasury bills. The mobilized
cash is held in a separate government account with the Reserve
Bank.
➢ ➢ 
Repo/reverse repo rate: These rates under the Liquidity Adjustment
Facility (LAF) determine the corridor for short-term money market
interest rates. In turn, this is expected to trigger movement in other
segments of the financial market and the real economy.
➢ ➢ 
Bank rate: It is the rate at which the Reserve Bank is ready to buy
or rediscount bills of exchange or other commercial papers. It also
signals the medium-term stance of monetary policy.
Open and Transparent Monetary Policy-Making
The Reserve Bank explains the relative importance of its objectives
in a given context in a transparent manner, emphasizes a consultative
approach in policy formulation as well as autonomy in policy operations
and harmony with other elements of macroeconomic policies. The
monetary policy formulation is aided by advice and input from:
➢ ➢ 
Technical Advisory Committee on Monetary Policy
➢ ➢ 
Pre-policy consultations with bankers, economists, market partici-
pants, chambers of commerce and industry and other stakeholders
➢ ➢ 
Regular discussions with credit heads of banks
➢ ➢ 
Feedback from banks and financial institutions
➢ ➢ 
Internal analysis
The RBI’s Annual Policy Statements, announced in April, are
followed by three quarterly reviews, in July, October and January. A
detailed background report — Review of Macro Economic and Monetary
131Notes
Developments — is released the day before the policy review. Faced
with multiple tasks and a complex mandate, the RBI emphasizes clear
and structured communication for effective functioning. Improving
transparency in decisions and actions is a constant endeavor of RBI. The
RBI looks at both short term and longer term issues related to liquidity
management. In the longer term, RBI monitor the developments in
global financial markets, capital flows, the government’s fiscal position
and inflationary pressures, with an eye toward encouraging strong and
sustainable economic growth.
2) Issuer of Currency
The RBI is the nation’s sole note issuing authority. Along with the
Government of India, RBI is responsible for the design and production and
overall management of the nation’s currency, with the goal of ensuring an
adequate supply of clean and genuine notes. The Reserve Bank also makes
sure there is an adequate supply of coins, produced by the government.
In consultation with the government, RBI routinely addresses security
issues and targets ways to enhance security features to reduce the risk of
counterfeiting or forgery.
The Department of Currency Management in Mumbai, in
cooperation with the Issue Departments in the Reserve Bank’s regional
offices, oversees the production and manages the distribution of currency.
Currency chests at more than 4,000 bank branches—typically commercial
banks—contain adequate quantity of notes and coins so that currency is
accessible to the public in all parts of the country. The Reserve Bank has
the authority to issue notes up to value of Rupees Ten Thousand.
Four printing presses actively print notes: Dewas in Madhya
Pradesh, Nasik in Maharashtra, Mysore in Karnataka, and Salboni in West
Bengal. The presses in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra are owned by the
Security Printing and Minting Corporation of India (SPMCIL), a wholly
owned company of the Government of India. The presses in Karnataka
and West Bengal are set up by BRBNMPL, a wholly owned subsidiary of
the Reserve Bank. Coins are minted by the Government of India. RBI is
the agent of the Government for distribution, issue and handling of coins.
Four mints are in operation: Mumbai, Noida in Uttar Pradesh, Kolkata,
and Hyderabad.
132Notes
RBI’s Anti-counterfeiting Measures
➢ ➢ 
Continual upgrades of bank note security features.
➢ ➢ 
Public awareness campaigns to educate citizens to help prevent
circulation of forged or counterfeit notes.
➢ ➢ 
Installation of note sorting machines.
RBI’s Clean Note Policy
➢ ➢ 
Education campaign on preferred way to handle notes: no stapling,
writing, excessive folding and the like.
➢ ➢ 
Timely removal of soiled notes: use of currency verification and
processing systems and sorting machines.
➢ ➢ 
Exchange facility for torn, mutilated or defective notes: at currency
chests of commercial banks and in Reserve Bank issue offices.
Focus continues on ensuring availability of clean notes and on
strengthening the security features of bank notes. Given the volumes
involved and costs incurred in the printing, transport, storage and removal
of unfit/soiled notes, the RBI is evaluating ways to extend the life of bank
notes—particularly in the lower denominations.
For example, RBI is considering issues of `10 banknotes in polymer.
3) Banker and Debt Manager to Government
Managing the government’s banking transactions is a key RBI role.
Like individuals, businesses and banks, governments need a banker to
carry out their financial transactions in an efficient and effective manner,
including the raising of resources from the public. As a banker to the
central government, the Reserve Bank maintains its accounts, receives
money into and makes payments out of these accounts and facilitates the
transfer of government funds. RBI also acts as the banker to those state
governments that have entered into an agreement with it.
The role as banker and debt manager to government includes
several distinct functions:
➢ ➢ 
Undertaking banking transactions for the central and state
133Notes
governments to facilitate receipts and payments and maintaining
their accounts.
➢ ➢ 
Managing the governments’ domestic debt with the objective of
raising the required amount of public debt in a cost-effective and
timely manner.
➢ ➢ 
Developing the market for government securities to enable the
government to raise debt at a reasonable cost, provide benchmarks
for raising resources by other entities and facilitate transmission of
monetary policy actions.
At the end of each day, our electronic system automatically
consolidates all of the government’s transactions to determine the net
final position. If the balance in the government’s account shows a negative
position, RBI extends a short-term, interest-bearing advance, called a
Ways and Means Advance - WMA – the limit or amount for which is set at
the beginning of each financial year in April.
The RBI’s Government Finance Operating Structure
The RBI’s Department of Government and Bank Accounts oversees
governments’ banking related activities. This department encompasses:
➢ ➢ 
Public accounts departments: manage the day-to-day aspects
of our Government’s banking operations. The Reserve Bank also
appoints commercial banks as its agents and uses their branches for
greater access to the government’s customers.
➢ ➢ 
Public debt offices: provide depository services for government
securities for institutions and service government loans.
➢ ➢ 
Central Accounts Section at Nagpur: consolidates the government’s
banking transactions.
The Internal Debt Management Department based in Mumbai
raises the government’s domestic debt and regulates and develops the
government securities market. RBI plans to enhance efficient and user-
friendly conduct of banking transactions for central and state governments
while ensuring cost-effective cash and debt management by deepening
and widening of the market for government securities.
134Notes
RBI as the Governments’ Debt Manager
In this role, RBI sets policies, in consultation with the government
and determine the operational aspects of raising money to help the
government finance its requirements:
➢ ➢ 
Determine the size, tenure and nature (fixed or floating rate) of the
loan.
➢ ➢ 
Define the issuing process including holding of auctions.
➢ ➢ 
Inform the public and potential investors about upcoming
government loan auctions
The Reserve Bank also undertakes market development efforts, in-
cluding enhanced secondary market trading and settlement mechanisms,
authorization of primary dealers and improved transparency of issuing
process to increase investor confidence, with the objective of broadening
and deepening the government securities market.
4) Banker to Banks
Like individual consumers, businesses and organizations of all
kinds, banks need their own mechanism to transfer funds and settle inter-
bank transactions - such as borrowing from and lending to other banks
– and customer transactions.
As the banker to banks, the Reserve Bank fulfills this role. In effect,
all banks operating in the country have accounts with the Reserve Bank,
just as individuals and businesses have accounts with their banks.
As the banker to banks, RBI focuses on:
➢ ➢ 
Enabling smooth, swift and seamless clearing and settlement of
inter-bank obligations.
➢ ➢ 
Providing an efficient means of funds transfer for banks.
➢ ➢ 
Enabling banks to maintain their accounts with us for purpose of
statutory reserve requirements and maintain transaction balances.
➢ ➢ 
Acting as lender of the last resort.
135Notes
The RBI provides similar products and services for the nation’s
banks to what banks offer their own customers. Here’s a look at how RBI
helps:
➢ ➢ 
Non-interest earning current accounts: Banks hold accounts
with the RBI based on certain terms and conditions, such as
maintenance of minimum balances. They can hold accounts at each
of our regional offices. Banks draw on these accounts to settle their
obligations arising from inter-bank settlement systems. Banks can
electronically transfer payments to other banks from this account,
using the Real Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS).
➢ ➢ 
Deposit Account Department: This department’s computerized
central monitoring system helps banks manage their funds position
in real time to maintain the optimum balance between surplus and
deficit centres.
➢ ➢ 
Remittance facilities: Banks and government departments can use
these facilities to transfer funds.
➢ ➢ 
Lender of the last resort: The Reserve Bank provides liquidity to
banks unable to raise short-term liquid resources from the inter-
bank market. Like other central banks, the Reserve Bank considers
this a critical function because it protects the interests of depositors,
which in turn, has a stabilizing impact on the financial system and
on the economy as a whole.
➢ ➢ 
Loans and advances: The Reserve Bank provides short-term loans
and advances to banks / financial institutions, when necessary, to
facilitate lending for specified purposes.
RBI is planning to implement core banking solutions for its
customers to enhance the safety and efficiency of the payments and
settlement services in the country.
5) Regulator of the Banking System
Banks are fundamental to the nation’s financial system. The central
bank has a critical role to play in ensuring the safety and soundness of
the banking system—and in maintaining financial stability and public
confidence in this system. As the regulator and supervisor of the banking
136Notes
system, the RBI protects the interests of depositors, ensures a framework
for orderly development and conduct of banking operations conducive
to customer interests and maintains overall financial stability through
preventive and corrective measures.
The Reserve Bank regulates and supervises the nation’s financial
system. Different departments of the Reserve Bank oversee the various
entities that comprise India’s financial infrastructure. RBI oversees:
➢ ➢ 
Commercial banks and all-India development financial
institutions: Regulated by the Department of Banking Operations
and Development, supervised by the Department of Banking
Supervision
➢ ➢ 
Urban co-operative banks: Regulated and supervised by the Urban
Banks Department
➢ ➢ 
Regional Rural Banks (RRB), District Central Cooperative Banks
and State Co-operative Bank: Regulated by the Rural Planning and
Credit Department and supervised by NABARD.
➢ ➢ 
Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFC): Regulated and
supervised by the Department of Non-Banking Supervision.
The Reserve Bank makes use of several supervisory tools such as
on-site inspections; Off-site surveillance, making use of required reporting
by the regulated entities; and thematic inspections, scrutiny and periodic
meetings. The Board for Financial Supervision oversees the Reserve Bank’s
regulatory and supervisory responsibilities.
The RBI’s Regulatory Role
As the nation’s financial regulator, the Reserve Bank handles a
range of activities, including
➢ ➢ 
Licensing
➢ ➢ 
Prescribing capital requirements
➢ ➢ 
Monitoring governance
➢ ➢ 
Setting prudential regulations to ensure solvency and liquidity of
the banks
137Notes
➢ ➢ 
Prescribing lending to certain priority sectors of the economy
➢ ➢ 
Regulating interest rates in specific areas
➢ ➢ 
Setting appropriate regulatory norms related to income recognition,
asset classification, provisioning, investment valuation, exposure
limits and the like
➢ ➢ 
Initiating new regulation
In the regulatory and supervisory arena, there are several challenges
going forward.
a) For commercial banks: Focus is on implementing Basel II norms,
which will require improved capital planning and risk management
skills.
b) For urban cooperative banks: Focus is on profitability, professional
management and technology enhancement.
c) For NBFCs: Focus is on identifying the interconnections and the
roles these institutions should play as the financial system deepens.
d) For regional rural banks: Focus is on enhancing capability through
IT and HR for serving the rural areas.
e) For rural cooperative banks: Focus is on ensuring that they meet
minimum prudential standards.
6) Manager of Foreign Exchange
With the transition to a market-based system for determining
the external value of the Indian rupee, the foreign exchange market in
India gained importance in the early reform period. In recent years, with
increasing integration of the Indian economy with the global economy
arising from greater trade and capital flows, the foreign exchange market
has evolved as a key segment of the Indian financial market.
The Reserve Bank plays a key role in the regulation and development
of the foreign exchange market and assumes three broad roles relating to
foreign exchange:
➢ ➢ 
Regulating transactions related to the external sector and facilitating
the development of the foreign exchange market.
138Notes
➢ ➢ 
Ensuring smooth conduct and orderly conditions in the domestic
foreign exchange market.
➢ ➢ 
Managing the foreign currency assets and gold reserves of the
country.
The Reserve Bank is responsible for administration of the Foreign
Exchange Management Act, 1999 and regulates the market by issuing
licences to banks and other select institutions to act as Authorized
Dealers in foreign exchange. The Foreign Exchange Department (FED) is
responsible for the regulation and development of the market. On a given
day, the foreign exchange rate reflects the demand for and supply of foreign
exchange arising from trade and capital transactions. The RBI’s Financial
Markets Department (FMD) participates in the foreign exchange market
by undertaking sales / purchases of foreign currency to ease volatility in
periods of excess demand for/supply of foreign currency.
The Department of External Investments and Operations (DEIO)
invests the country’s foreign exchange reserves built up by purchase of
foreign currency from the market. In investing its foreign assets, the
Reserve Bank is guided by three principles: safety, liquidity and return.
The challenge for RBI is to liberalize and develop the foreign
exchange market, with an eye toward ushering in greater market efficiency
while ensuring financial stability in an increasingly global financial market
environment. With current account convertibility achieved in 1994, the
key focus is now on capital account management.
7) Regulator and Supervisor of Payment and Settlement Systems
Payment and settlement systems play an important role in improving
overall economic efficiency. They consist of all the diverse arrangements
that we use to systematically transfer money - currency, paper instruments
such as cheques, and various electronic channels.
The Payment and Settlement Systems Act of 2007 (PSS Act) gives
the Reserve Bank oversight authority, including regulation and supervision,
for the payment and settlement systems in the country. In this role, RBI
focuses on the development and functioning of safe, secure and efficient
payment and settlement mechanisms.
139Notes
The Reserve Bank has a two-tiered structure. The first tier provides
the basic framework for our payment systems. The second tier focuses
on supervision of this framework. As part of the basic framework, the
RBI’s network of secure systems handles various types of payment and
settlement activities.
Most operate on the security platform of the Indian Financial
Network (INFINET), using digital signatures for further security of
transactions. Here is an overview of the various systems used:
a) Retail payment systems: Facilitating cheques clearing, electronic
funds transfer, through National Electronic Funds Transfer
(NEFT), settlement of card payments and bulk payments, such as
electronic clearing services. Operated through local clearing houses
throughout the country.
b) Large value systems: Facilitating settlement of inter-bank
transactions from financial markets. These include:
➢ ➢ 
Real Time Gross Settlement System (RTGS): for funds transfers
➢ ➢ 
Securities Settlement System: for the government securities
market
➢ ➢ 
Foreign Exchange Clearing: for transactions involving foreign
currency
c) Department of Payment and Settlement Systems: The Reserve
Bank’s payment and settlement systems regulatory arm.
d) Department of Information Technology: Tech support for the
payment systems and for the Reserve Bank’s internal IT systems.
RBI is proactively identifying and addressing issues that help
mitigate the risks for large value systems. Efforts on the retail payment
system side will focus on operational efficiencies, cost effectiveness,
innovation and risk management.
8) Developmental Role
This role is, perhaps, the most unheralded aspect of our activities,
yet it remains among the most critical. This includes ensuring that credit is
available to the productive sectors of the economy, establishing institutions
designed to build the country’s financial infrastructure, expanding access
140Notes
to affordable financial services and promoting financial education and
literacy.
Over the years, the Reserve Bank has added new institutions as
the economy has evolved. Some of the institutions established by the RBI
include:
➢ ➢ 
Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (1962), to
provide protection to bank depositors and guarantee cover to credit
facilities extended to certain categories of small borrowers.
➢ ➢ 
Unit Trust of India (1964), the first mutual fund of the country.
➢ ➢ 
Industrial Development Bank of India (1964), a development
finance institution for industry.
➢ ➢ 
National Bank of Agriculture and Rural Development (1982), for
promoting rural and agricultural credit.
➢ ➢ 
Discount and Finance House of India (1988), a money market
intermediary and a primary dealer in government securities.
➢ ➢ 
National Housing Bank (1989), an apex financial institution for
promoting and regulating housing finance.
➢ ➢ 
Securities and Trading Corporation of India (1994), a primary
dealer.
The Reserve Bank continues its developmental role, while
specifically focusing on financial inclusion. Key tools in this on-going
effort include:
a) Directed credit for lending to priority sector and weaker sections:
The goal here is to facilitate/enhance credit flow to employment
intensive sectors such as agriculture, micro and small enterprises
(MSE), as well as for affordable housing and education loans.
b) Lead Bank Scheme: A commercial bank is designated as a lead
bank in each district in the country and this bank is responsible for
ensuring banking development in the district through coordinated
efforts between banks and government officials. The Reserve Bank
has assigned a Lead District Manager for each district who acts
141Notes
as a catalytic force for promoting financial inclusion and smooth
working between government and banks.
c) Sector specific refinance: The Reserve Bank makes available
refinance to banks against their credit to the export sector. In
exceptional circumstances, it can provide refinance against lending
to other sectors.
d) Strengthening and supporting small local banks: This includes
regional rural banks and cooperative banks
e) Financial inclusion: Expanding access to finance and promoting
financial literacy are a part of our outreach efforts.
The development role of the Reserve Bank will continue to evolve,
along with the Indian economy. Through the outreach efforts and emphasis
on customer service, the Reserve Bank will continue to make efforts to fill
the gaps to promote inclusive economic growth and stability.
Financial Inclusion and Literacy:
Expanding Access & Encouraging Education
Expanding access to and knowledge about finance is a fundamental
aspect of the Reserve Bank’s operations. These efforts are critical to
ensuring that the benefits of a growing and healthy economy reach all
segments of the population. RBI’s work here includes:
➢ ➢ 
Encouraging provision of affordable financial services like zero-

Lesson 2.2 - Objectives of Monetary Policy, Methods of Credit
Control and Autonomy of Central Banks
Learning Objectives
➢ ➢ To understand the objectives of monetary policy.
➢ ➢ To understand the methods of quantitative and qualitative credit
controls.
➢ ➢ To give an insight into the autonomy of central bank systems
Monetary Policy in India
Objectives and Framework of Monetary Policy
In India, the objectives of monetary policy evolved for maintaining
price stability and ensuring adequate flow of credit to the productive
sectors of the economy. With progressive liberalization and increasing
globalization of the economy, maintaining orderly conditions in the
financial markets emerged as an additional policy objective. Thus,
monetary policy in India endeavours to maintain a judicious balance
between:
➢ ➢ 
Price stability
➢ ➢ 
Economic growth
➢ ➢ 
Financial stability.
The case of price stability as the prime objective of monetary policy
rests on the assumption that volatility in prices creates uncertainty in
economic decision making. Rising prices affect savings adversely while
they make speculative investments more attractive. The most important
contribution of the financial system to an economy is its ability to augment
savings and allocate resources more efficiently. A regime of rising prices,
thus, clearly affects the atmosphere for promotion of savings and allocation
of investment. Furthermore, the domestic inflation rate also has a bearing
on the exchange rate of the currency.
144Notes
Operating Procedures of Monetary Policy in India
Operating procedure refer to the day to day management of
monetary conditions consistent with the overall stance of monetary policy.
It is in essence the ‘nuts and bolts’ of monetary policy. It involves four
activities, viz.,
➢ ➢ 
The choice of the operational target;
➢ ➢ 
The nature, extent and the frequency of different money market
operations by the central bank;
➢ ➢ 
The use and width of the corridor for very short-term market
interest rates; and
➢ ➢ 
The manner of signaling policy intentions.
The operating procedure is explained in detail below:
1) Issues and Options: The liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) has
emerged as the key element of the present operating procedure
of monetary policy. It has generally helped in steering the desired
trajectory of interest rates in response to evolving market conditions.
2) Monetary Transmission: At the heart of the operating framework
is the nature of monetary transmission. The pertinent question
is whether the interest rate channel of monetary transmission is
working. Monetary transmission is substantially more effective in a
deficit liquidity situation than in a surplus liquidity situation.
3) Policy Rate: The present LAF framework is such that the operating
policy rate alternates between the repo rate and the reverse repo
rate, depending on the prevailing liquidity condition. In a surplus
liquidity condition, the reverse repo rate becomes the operating
policy rate. In a deficit liquidity situation, the repo rate becomes
the policy rate. Going by international best practices, it is
unconventional to have two policy rates.
4) Bank Rate: The RBI in its tool kit has the Bank Rate which is
essentially a discount rate. Under Section 49 of the RBI of India Act,
the Bank Rate has been defined as “the standard rate at which it [the
Reserve Bank] is prepared to buy or re-discount bills of exchange or
other commercial paper eligible for purchase under this Act”. While
145Notes
the Bank Rate was an important instrument of monetary control,
its importance declined once the LAF system was instituted and
progressively refinance facilities were provided at the repo rate. It is
now used for calculating penalty on default in the cash reserve ratio
(CRR) and the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) as required by the RBI
Act and BR Act.
5) Constituents of the Corridor: The prescription of the Bank Rate by
itself will not make it active unless there is liquidity facilities linked
to the Bank Rate. It is recommended to have the institution of a
collateralized Exceptional Standing Facility (ESF) at the Bank Rate
up to one per cent of the Net Demand and Time Liabilities (NDTL)
of banks carved out of their required SLR portfolio. This facility is
not entirely new. In the recent episode of liquidity tightness, the
RBI has been providing additional liquidity up to 1 to 2 per cent
of NDTL but on an ad hoc basis at the repo rate. The advantages
of this facility are four-fold. First, it will provide an upper bound
to the policy rate corridor. Second, it will provide a safety valve
against unanticipated liquidity shocks. Third, it will help stabilize
the overnight interest rate around the repo rate in a liquidity deficit
situation. Fourth, it will enhance the liquidity attribute of the SLR
portfolio without compromising its prudential nature.
6) Width of the Corridor: First, it should not be so wide as to induce
volatility in short-term money market rates. Second, it should not be
so narrow that it retards the development of the short-term money
market by taking away the incentive from market participants to
deal among themselves before approaching the central bank.
7) Operating Target: The overnight call money rate has been the
operating target of monetary policy as the monetary transmission
is the fastest to this segment. However, in the past few years, the
turnover in the uncollateralized (inter-bank money market) segment
has declined sharply, while that in the overnight collateralized
market segment, viz., the Collateralized Borrowing and Lending
Obligations (CBLO) and market repo, has increased. The prudential
limits as prescribed by the RBI have not constrained the growth
of the call money market; rather it has increased the stability of
the money market with an increasing share of the collateralized
segment.
146Notes
8) Timing and Frequency of LAF: The RBI is currently conducting
LAF twice a day. This has provided flexibility to market participants
and has helped contain volatility in the overnight market.
9) Instruments for Liquidity Management: In order to keep the
liquidity in the LAF window at the optimal level of (+)/(-) one per
cent of NDTL for effective monetary transmission, the RBI needs
to have instruments at its disposal to manage excessive liquidity
deficit/surplus conditions. The role of the LAF window is to deal
with frictional liquidity deficit/surplus. Liquidity of a more durable
nature needs to be managed with other instruments.
10) Collateral: The RBI holds Special Bonds (oil bonds), apart from
government securities, in its portfolio. Oil bonds are treated as
non-SLR securities. With effect from July 27, 2010, government
securities obtained under reverse repo are not reckoned for the
purpose of SLR of banks.
11) Liquidity Forecast: To ensure that the operating target does not
deviate from the policy rate, liquidity forecast plays a crucial
role. Liquidity forecast in the RBI is made on a weekly basis up to
four weeks ahead. A quick back-testing analysis of these liquidity
forecasts shows that the liquidity projections during the past two
years have been satisfactory. The one-week-ahead forecasts show a
relatively lower margin of error compared with the forecasts for the
subsequent weeks. However, the discrepancy in liquidity forecast
has increased, reflecting large swings in government cash balances.
12) Dissemination of Liquidity Forecast: Several central banks
disseminate liquidity forecasts, such as the ECB (weekly), Bank of
England (daily), Bank of Japan (daily and monthly), Bank of Canada
(daily) and Reserve Bank of Australia (daily). The dissemination of
forecasts is intended primarily to facilitate the liquidity management
of banks. However, following the global financial crisis, some
advanced countries have stopped disseminating information on
liquidity forecasts, such as the US Federal Reserve, Bank of England
(suspended since August2009), and Swiss National Bank and among
EMEs, Brazil and the Bank of Korea. While the dissemination of
forecasts helps market participants to make better assessments on
the factors affecting liquidity and on the possible direction and
147Notes
quantum of central bank intervention, any inaccurate assessments
may increase uncertainty in financial markets. At present, the RBI
publishes the information on banks’ cash balances with the RBI
with a lag of three days.
13) Maintenance of the CRR: An area of uncertainty in liquidity forecast
is the pattern of CRR maintenance by banks. At present, banks, on
average, are required to maintain 100 per cent of the required CRR
during the fortnight with a daily minimum maintenance of 70 per
cent. However, banks frontload their CRR balances with the RBI
in the first week of the reporting Friday, the front loading being
higher in deficit liquidity situations. This accentuates the liquidity
stress. But at the system level, banks tend to maintain over 80 per
cent of their required balance throughout the maintenance period.
14) Seamless Movements of Funds and Securities: Interest rate in the
uncollateralized segment is expected to be higher than that in the
collateralized segment due to the credit risk involved in the former.
However, interest rates in the overnight inter-bank call money
market deviate from the operating policy rate significantly even if
the interest rate in the collateralized segments, i.e., the CBLO and
market repo, remains close to the operating policy rate. There are
two reasons for this:
a) Difficulty in providing sufficient collateral by some banks
b) S ettlement of securities and funds under different segments
occurring at different times, necessitating the use of intra-day
liquidity or the need for additional securities.
Changes in Operating Procedure of Monetary Policy in India
Consistent with the objectives and policy framework, the operating
procedure of monetary policy in India has also witnessed significant
changes. The choice of targets, instruments and operating procedure was
circumscribed to a large extent by the nature of the financial markets and
the institutional arrangements.
➢ ➢ 
During the monetary targeting period (1985-1998), while M3
growth provided the nominal anchor, reserve money was used as
148Notes
the operating target and cash reserve ratio (CRR) was used as the
principal operating instrument.
➢ ➢ 
Besides CRR, in the pre-reform period prior to 1991, given the
command and control nature of the economy, the Reserve Bank
had to resort to direct instruments like interest rate regulations and
selective credit control. These instruments were used intermittently
to neutralize the expansionary impact of large fiscal deficits which
were partly monetized.
➢ ➢ 
The administered interest rate regime kept the yield rate of the
government securities artificially low. The demand for them was
created through periodic hikes in the Statutory Liquidity Ratio
(SLR) for banks. The year 1992-93 was a landmark in the sense
that the market borrowing programme of the government was
put through the auction process. This was supported by a phased
deregulation of lending rates in the credit market.
➢ ➢ 
The Reserve Bank also brought down the SLR and CRR drastically.
All these developments resulted in a decline in pre-emption of
resources from the banking.
➢ ➢ 
The Narsimham Committee (1998), however, noted that the
money market continued to remain lopsided, thin and volatile and
the Reserve Bank also had no effective presence in the market.
Therefore, it reiterated the need to transform the call money market
into a pure inter-bank market and recommended the Reserve Bank’s
operations to be market-based.
➢ ➢ 
Following these recommendations, the Reserve Bank introduced
the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) in June 2000 to manage
market liquidity on a daily basis and also to transmit interest rate
signals to the market. Under the LAF, the Reserve Bank’s policy
reverse repo and repo rates set the corridor for overnight market
interest rates. Thus, Open Market Operations (OMSs) including
LAF emerged as the dominant instrument of monetary policy,
though CRR continued to be used as an additional instrument of
policy.
➢ ➢ 
The call money market was transformed into a pure inter-bank
market by August 2005 in a phased manner.
149Notes
➢ ➢ 
Concomitantly, to enable a smooth exit of non-banks, new
instruments such as the CBLO were introduced in January 2003.
➢ ➢ 
With the introduction of prudential limits on borrowing and lending
by banks in the call money market, the collateralized money market
segments developed rapidly.
➢ ➢ 
Maturities of other money market instruments such as commercial
papers (CPs) and certificates of deposits (CDs) were gradually
shortened to seven days in order to align the maturity structure.
➢ ➢ 
Managing large and persistent capital inflows in excess of the
absorptive capacity of the economy added another dimension to
the liquidity management operations during the 2000s. Although,
initially the liquidity impact of large capital inflows were sterilized
through OMOs and LAF operations, given the finite stock of
government securities in the Reserve Bank’s portfolio and the legal
restrictions on issuance of its own paper, additional instruments
were needed to contain liquidity of a more enduring nature.
➢ ➢ 
This led to the introduction of the Market Stabilization Scheme
(MSS) in April 2004. Under this scheme, short-term government
securities were issued but the amount remained impounded in the
Reserve Bank’s balance sheet for sterilization purposes.
➢ ➢ 
Interestingly, in the face of reversal of capital flows during the
recent crisis, unwinding of such sterilized liquidity under the MSS
helped to ease liquidity conditions.
➢ ➢ 
In response to the measures taken to develop the money market,
over the years the turnover in various market segments increased
significantly.
➢ ➢ 
All these reforms have also led to improvement in liquidity
management operations by the Reserve Bank as evident from the
stability in call money rates, which also helped improve integration of
various money market segments and thereby effective transmission
of policy signals.
➢ ➢ 
The rule-based fiscal policy pursued under the Fiscal Responsibility
and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, by easing fiscal dominance,
contributed to overall improvement in monetary management.
150Notes
➢ ➢ 
Notwithstanding such improvements at the short-end of the
financial market spectrum, the transmission of the policy signals
to banks’ lending rates has been rather slow given the rigidities
in the system, particularly the preference for fixed interest rate
on term deposits. Against the backdrop of ample liquidity in the
system more recently, as banks have reduced their deposit rates, the
effective lending rates would have shown further moderation.
Monetary Policy Formulation Processes
The process of monetary policy in India had traditionally been
largely internal with only the end product of actions being made public.
The process includes a wide range of inputs involving the internal staff,
market participants, academics, financial market experts and the Bank’s
Board. At the apex of the policy process is the Governor, assisted closely by
Deputy Governors and guided by deliberations of the Board of Directors.
A Committee of the Board meets every week to review the monetary,
economic and financial conditions and renders advice on policy. There
are several other standing and ad hoc committees or groups which play a
critical role with regard to policy advice. An interdepartmental Financial
Markets Committee focuses on day-to-day market operations and tactics
while periodic monetary policy strategy meetings analyze strategies on an
ongoing basis.
Methods of Credit Controls
Since the 1970s, the Reserve Bank faced the twin problems of
making provisions for financing economic growth and ensuring price
stability in the wake of a sharp increase in money supply emanating from
the rapid expansion in credit. The increased public expenditure and the
coincident rise in banks deposits began to place a greater pressure on
the effectiveness of monetary policy. The Reserve Bank had to adopt a
balancing approach to handle this knife-edged problem and resorted to
the policy of a ‘controlled expansion’ of credit to meet the twin objectives
of making provision of credit for attaining faster rate of economic growth
and ensuring price stability.
151Notes
Quantitative Methods of Credit Control
The Quantitative measures of credit control include the following:
Bank Rate Policy
The bank rate is the official interest rate at which RBI rediscounts
the approved bills held by commercial banks. For controlling the credit,
inflation and money supply, RBI will increase the Bank Rate. If the bank
rate is increased, the commercial banks will have to pay a higher rate of
interest for their borrowings from RBI. In turn, commercial banks will
charge higher interest rate when they grant loans to their customers. Thus,
the borrowers will be discouraged to borrow. The trading and business
activities will be reduced. The reduced money supply and price level in
turn is brought down.
Open Market Operations
OMO-The Open Market Operations refer to direct sales and
purchase of securities and bills in the open market by RBI. The aim is to
control volume of credit. By selling in the money market, the RBI tries to
absorb the excess money supply with the commercial banks, insurance
companies and financial institutions. During inflation, the sale of security
by RBI will encourage commercial banks to buy. In this process, the surplus
cash with the commercial banks are left with fewer amounts of funds, they
cannot lend more and so borrowers will find it difficult to obtain loan.
This will bring down the economic activities and there by the income.
Variable Reserve Ratios and Rate
a. Cash Reserve ratio: Cash Reserve ratio refers to that portion of total
deposits in commercial banks which it has to keep with RBI as cash
reserves. If CRR is reduced, the banks will be able to give more loans.
Increased lending by banks will lead to more economic activities.
During inflation, the CRR will be increased and this will leave the
bank to lend only less.
b. Statutory Liquidity Ratio: It refers to that portion of deposits
with the banks which it has to keep with itself as liquid assets (old,
152Notes
approved government securities, etc). This ratio helps the RBI to
control money supply with the banks.
c. Repo rate: Repo rate is a rate at which banks borrow rupees from
RBI against approved securities to fulfill short term gap.
d. Reverse Repo rate: Reverse Repo rate is rate at which RBI would
borrow money from banks.
If RBI wishes to control credit and discourage credit it would
increase CRR & SLR.
Qualitative Methods of Credit Control
Qualitative credit control is used by the RBI for selective purposes.
Some of them are
1. Margin requirements: This refers to difference between the
securities offered and amount borrowed by the banks. The RBI will
prescribe the percentage of margin a bank should maintain while
granting loan. During the inflation, the RBI will increase the margin
leaving lesser amount of cash at the disposal of the borrower. This
will affect their borrowing capacity and there by demand for other
goods. During depression, the margin will be reduced.
2. Consumer Credit Regulations: This refers to issuing rules
regarding down payments and maximum maturities of installment
credit for purchase of goods. Based on the scenario (inflation or
depression), the RBI will increase or decrease the down payment or
any other rules.
3. Control of Bank Advances: The RBI may instruct the banks not to
lend for undesirable and unproductive purposes and direct credit
only for productive purposes. By this way, the RBI controls bank
advances.
4. RBI Guidelines: RBI issues oral, written statements, appeals,
guidelines, warnings, etc. to the banks.
5. Rationing of credit: The RBI controls the credit granted/allocated
by commercial banks. Credit rationing is a method by which the
distribution of credit is done according to the conditions of the
153Notes
national economy. If there is more demand in one sector (say
agriculture), then the RBI may fix certain percentage of loanable
funds for that sector individually and in relation to total advances.
6. Moral Suasion: It refers to psychological means and informal
means of selective credit control. A request will be made by RBI
to banks to cooperate with its policies. For this method, the RBI
should have a cordial relationship with banks.
7. Direct Action: This step is taken by the RBI against banks that
do not fulfill conditions and requirements. RBI may refuse to
rediscount their papers or may give excess credits or charge a penal
rate of interest over and above the Bank rate, for credit demanded
beyond a limit.
Autonomy of Central Bank Systems
Areas of Central Bank Independence
Central bank independence generally relates to three areas,viz.,
personnel matters; financial aspects; and conduct of policy.
(i) Personnel independence refers to the extent to which the
Government distances itself from appointment, term of office and
dismissal procedures of top central bank officials and the governing
board. It also includes the extent and nature of representation of
the Government in the governing body of the central bank.
(ii) Financial independence relates to the freedom of the central bank
to decide the extent to which Government expenditure is either
directly or indirectly financed via central bank credits. Direct or
automatic access of Government to central bank credits would
naturally imply that monetary policy is subordinated to fiscal
policy.
(iii) Policy independence is related to the flexibility given to the
central bank in the formulation and execution of monetary policy.
Recent literature has stressed the difference between goal
independence and instrument independence.
154Notes
(iv) Goal independence refers to a situation where the central bank
itself can choose the policy priorities of stabilizing output or prices
at any given point of time, thus setting the goal of monetary policy.
(v)
Instrument independence implies that the central bank is only
free to choose the means to achieve the objective set by the
Government.
Evolving Relationship with the Government and RBI - A Review
Rangarajan (Then RBI Governor) defined the independence of central
banks as “the institutional arrangements for the conduct of monetary policy”
and condemned the practice of automatic monetization of the Government’s
fiscal deficit through the issue of ad hoc treasury bills as the principal factor
impinging on the effective conduct of monetary policy in the Indian context.
The evolving relationship between the Government and the RBI
can be broadly divided in to four distinct phases.
First Phase
During this phase, which may be called infancy and uncertainty,
the RBI was virtually subservient to the dictates of the Government and
measures were taken to curb its capacity for independent actions. The
fact that the rate of inflation was modest compared to other developing
countries during this period is indicative of the success of macro-
policy management and facilitated the task of the RBI in pursuing other
developmental activities.
Second Phase
During this period, the RBI was vigorously involved in promoting
the institutionalization of credit to agriculture and industry in pursuant to
the overall objectives of the respective Five-Year Plans. Another important
objective of the RBI was the promotion and mobilization of savings by
reinforcing the foundations of the banking system. This, however, does
not mean that differences between the RBI and the Government over
economic policies were totally absent. For example, the RBI did not approve
of the substitution of financial planning by a kind of ‘physical planning’.
155Notes
Another major area of discord between the RBI and the Government in
the late 1950s related to the financing of the cooperatives and the pattern
of organization of the lending agencies. Interestingly, during the early
1960s, Governor Iyengar identified four areas of potential conflict
between the Bank and the central government. These were interest rate
policy, deficit financing, cooperative credit policies and management
of substandard banks. This phase, from nationalization of the RBI in 1948
till nationalization of major commercial banks in 1969, may be considered
as maturing of the RBI into a full-fledged professionally managed central
bank, perhaps one of the foremost in developing countries.
Third Phase
The third phase that changed the contour of this relationship
started with the nationalization of major banks in 1969. In this regard,
the nationalization of banks and transfer of ownership to Government
provided a captive market for the government. Simultaneously, recourse
to the RBI credit was also high, leading to high levels of monetization.
This phase was characterized by several features to indicate considerable
influence or dominance of Government over the RBI.
Fourth Phase
During this phase, the relationship between the central bank
and the Government took a new turn through a welcome development
in the supplemental agreement between the Government and the RBI
in September 1994 on the abolition of the ad hoc treasury bills to be
made effective from April 1997. The measure eliminated the automatic
monetization of Government deficits and resulted in considerable
moderation of the monetized deficit in the latter half of the Nineties.
Significant achievements in financial reforms including strengthening
of the banking supervision capabilities of the RBI have enhanced its
credibility and instrument independence.
Conclusion
The efficacy of the emerging operating procedures of monetary
policy remains a matter of debate. There is very little doubt that the Reserve
Bank is now able to set an informal corridor through two-way day-to-day
156Notes
liquidity management. The pass-through to the credit market, however,
does not appear very effective because of a variety of factors such as the
overhang of high cost deposits, large non-performing assets and high non-
operating expenses in the banking system. As a result, real interest rates
continue to remain high. This underscores the need to further strengthen
structural measures to impart the necessary flexibility to the interest
rate structure in the credit markets. The phasing out of ad hoc Treasury
Bills and the enactment of Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management
(FRBM) legislation are two important milestones in providing safeguards
to monetary policy from the consequences of fiscal expansion and ensuring
better monetary-fiscal co-ordination.

Lesson 2.3 - Indian Money Market, Capital Market And Banking
Legislations
Learning Objectives
➢ ➢ To understand the features and components of Indian money
market
➢ ➢ To understand the features and components of Indian capital market
➢ ➢ To understand the banking legislations in India
Money Market
Money market means market where money or its equivalent can be
traded. Money is synonym of liquidity. Money market consists of financial
institutions and dealers in money or credit who wish to generate liquidity.
It is better known as a place where large institutions and government
manage their short term cash needs. For generation of liquidity, short
term borrowing and lending is done by these financial institutions and
dealers. Money Market is part of financial market where instruments with
high liquidity and very short term maturities are traded. Due to highly
liquid nature of securities and their short term maturities, money market
is treated as a safe place. Hence, money market is a market where short
term obligations such as treasury bills, commercial papers and bankers
acceptances are bought and sold.
The money market is a key component of the financial system as it
is the fulcrum of monetary operations conducted by the central bank in its
pursuit of monetary policy objectives. It is a market for short-term funds
with maturity ranging from overnight to one year and includes financial
instruments that are deemed to be close substitutes of money.
Structure of Money Market
The structure of money market can be divided into two
parts, viz., organized and unorganized. Organized structure includes
158Notes
➢ ➢ 
Reserve bank of India.
➢ ➢ 
DFHI (discount and finance house of India).
➢ ➢ 
Commercial banks (Public sector banks, SBI & its associates,
Cooperative banks, Private sector banks and Foreign banks)
➢ ➢ 
Development bank IDBI, IFCI, ICICI, NABARD, LIC, GIC,
UTI etc.
The unorganized structure include:
➢ ➢ 
Indigenous banks
➢ ➢ 
Money lenders
➢ ➢ 
Chits &Nidhis
➢ ➢ 
Co-operative Sector (State and central cooperative banks, Primary
urban banks, Primary Agri. credit societies, State, Central and
Primary Land development banks)
Functions of Money Market
The money market performs three broad functions.
1) It provides an equilibrating mechanism for demand and supply of
short-term funds.
2) It enables borrowers and lenders of short term funds to fulfill their
borrowing and investment requirements at an efficient market
clearing price.
3) It provides an avenue for central bank intervention in influencing
both quantum and cost of liquidity in the financial system, thereby
transmitting monetary policy impulses to the real economy.
The objective of monetary management by the central bank is to
align money market rates with the key policy rate. As excessive money
market volatility could deliver confusing signals about the stance of
monetary policy, it is critical to ensure orderly market behaviour, from
the point of view of both monetary and financial stability. Thus, efficient
functioning of the money market is important for the effectiveness of
monetary policy.
159Notes
Features of Money Market in India
1) It is a market purely for short-term funds or financial assets called
near money.
2) It deals with financial assets having a maturity period less than one
year only.
3) In Money Market, transaction transactions can be done through oral
communication, relevant document and written communication.
4) Transactions have to be conducted without the help of brokers.
5) It is not single homogeneous market, it comprises of several sub
market like call money market, acceptance bill market.
6) The players in the money market include commercial banks,
acceptance houses and NBFC (Non-Banking Financial Companies).
Importance of Money Market
1) Development of trade and industry.
2) Development of capital market.
3) Smooth functioning of commercial banks.
4) Effective central bank control.
5) Formulation of suitable monetary policy.
6) Non-inflationary source of finance to government.
Composition of Money Market
Money Market consists of a number of sub-markets which
collectively constitute the money market. They are Call Money Market,
Commercial Bills Market, Acceptance Market, and Treasury bill Market.
Money Market Instruments
Investment in money market is done through money market
instruments. Money market instrument meets short term requirements
of the borrowers and provides liquidity to the lenders. Common Money
Market Instruments are as follows:
160Notes
a. Treasury Bills (T-Bills)
b. Central Government Securities (Gilt-edged Securities)
c. State Government and Public Sector Instruments
d. Municipal Bonds
e. Commercial Papers
f. Certificates of deposits
g. Bills Rediscounting
h. Call/Notice Money Market
i. Repurchase Agreements (Repos)
j. Inter Bank Participation
k. Bank deposits
l. Term Money
m. Corporate Debentures and Bonds
n. Bankers Acceptance
o. Commercial Bills
p. Fringe Market
Let us understand important money market instruments in detail.
a). Treasury Bills (T-Bills)
Treasury Bills, one of the safest money market instruments, are
short-term borrowing instruments of the Central Government of the
Country issued through the Central Bank (RBI in India). They are zero risk
instruments, and hence the returns are not so attractive. It is available both
in primary market as well as secondary market. It is a promise to pay a said
sum after a specified period. T-bills are short-term securities that mature
in one year or less from their issue date. They are issued with three-month,
six-month and one-year maturity periods. The Central Government issues
T- Bills at a price less than their face value (par value). They are issued
with a promise to pay full face value on maturity. So, when the T-Bills
mature, the government pays the holder its face value. The difference
between the purchase price and the maturity value is the interest income
earned by the purchaser of the instrument. T-Bills are issued through a
bidding process at auctions. The bid can be prepared either competitively
or non-competitively. In the second type of bidding, return required is not
specified and the one determined at the auction is received on maturity.
161Notes
Whereas, in case of competitive bidding, the return required on
maturity is specified in the bid. In case the return specified is too high then
the T-Bill might not be issued to the bidder. At present, the Government
of India issues three types of treasury bills through auctions, namely,
91-day, 182-day and 364-day. There are no treasury bills issued by State
Governments. Treasury bills are available for a minimum amount of `25K
and in its multiples. While 91-day T-bills are auctioned every week on
Wednesdays, 182-day and 364- day T-bills are auctioned every alternate
week on Wednesdays.
The Reserve Bank of India issues a quarterly calendar of T-bill
auctions which is available at the Banks’ website. It also announces the
exact dates of auction, the amount to be auctioned and payment dates
by issuing press releases prior to every auction. Payment by allottees at
the auction is required to be made by debit to their/ custodian’s current
account. T-bills auctions are held on the Negotiated Dealing System
(NDS) and the members electronically submit their bids on the system.
NDS is an electronic platform for facilitating dealing in Government
Securities and Money Market Instruments. RBI issues these instruments
to absorb liquidity from the market by contracting the money supply. In
banking terms, this is called Reverse Repurchase (Reverse Repo). On the
other hand, when RBI purchases back these instruments at a specified date
mentioned at the time of transaction, liquidity is infused in the market.
This is called Repo (Repurchase) transaction.
b) Repurchase Agreements
Repurchase transactions, called Repo or Reverse Repo are
transactions or short term loans in which two parties agree to sell and
repurchase the same security. They are usually used for overnight
borrowing. Repo/Reverse Repo transactions can be done only between the
parties approved by RBI and in RBI approved securities viz. GOI and State
Government Securities, T-Bills, PSU Bonds, FI Bonds, Corporate Bonds
etc. Under repurchase agreement the seller sells specified securities with
an agreement to repurchase the same at a mutually decided future date
and price. Similarly, the buyer purchases the securities with an agreement
to resell the same to the seller on an agreed date at a predetermined price.
Such a transaction is called a Repo when viewed from the perspective of the
seller of the securities and Reverse Repo when viewed from the perspective
162Notes
of the buyer of the securities. Thus, whether a given agreement is termed as
a Repo or Reverse Repo depends on which party initiated the transaction.
The lender or buyer in a Repo is entitled to receive compensation for use
of funds provided to the counterparty. Effectively the seller of the security
borrows money for a period of time (Repo period) at a particular rate of
interest mutually agreed with the buyer of the security who has lent the
funds to the seller. The rate of interest agreed upon is called the Repo
rate. The Repo rate is negotiated by the counterparties independently of
the coupon rate or rates of the underlying securities and is influenced by
overall money market conditions.
c) Commercial Papers
Commercial paper is a low-cost alternative to bank loans. It is a
short term unsecured promissory note issued by corporate and financial
institutions at a discounted value on face value. They are usually issued
with fixed maturity between 1 to 270 days and for financing of accounts
receivables, inventories and meeting short term liabilities. Say, for example,
a company has receivables of ` 1 lakh with credit period 6 months. It will
not be able to liquidate its receivables before 6 months. The company
is in need of funds. It can issue commercial papers. They yield higher
returns as compared to T-Bills as they are less secure in comparison to
these bills; however chances of default are almost negligible but are not
zero risk instruments. Commercial paper being an instrument not backed
by any collateral, only firms with high quality credit ratings will find
buyers easily without offering any substantial discounts. They are issued
by corporate to impart flexibility in raising working capital resources at
market determined rates. Commercial Papers are actively traded in the
secondary market since they are issued in the form of promissory notes
and are freely transferable in demat form.
d) Certificate of Deposit
It is a short term borrowing more like a bank term deposit account.
It is a promissory note issued by a bank in form of a certificate entitling the
bearer to receive interest. The certificate bears the maturity date, the fixed
rate of interest and the value. It can be issued in any denomination. They
are stamped and transferred by endorsement. Its term generally ranges
from three months to five years and restricts the holders to withdraw
163Notes
funds on demand. However, on payment of certain penalty the money can
be withdrawn on demand also. The returns on certificate of deposits are
higher than T-Bills because it assumes higher level of risk. While buying
Certificate of Deposit, return method should be seen. Returns can be based
on Annual Percentage Yield (APY) or Annual Percentage Rate (APR).
In APY, interest earned is based on compounded interest calculation.
However, in APR method, simple interest calculation is done to generate
the return. Accordingly, if the interest is paid annually, equal return is
generated by both APY and APR methods. However, if interest is paid
more than once in a year, it is beneficial to opt APY over APR.
e) Bankers Acceptance
It is a short term credit investment created by a non financial
firm and guaranteed by a bank to make payment. It is simply a bill of
exchange drawn by a person and accepted by a bank. It is a buyer’s promise
to pay to the seller a certain specified amount at certain date. The same
is guaranteed by the banker of the buyer in exchange for a claim on the
goods as collateral. The person drawing the bill must have a good credit
rating otherwise the Banker’s Acceptance will not be tradable. The most
common term for these instruments is 90 days. However, they can vary
from 30 days to180 days. For corporations, it acts as a negotiable time
draft for financing imports, exports and other transactions in goods and
is highly useful when the credit worthiness of the foreign trade party is
unknown. The seller need not hold it until maturity and can sell off the
same in secondary market at discount from the face value to liquidate its
receivables.
f) Commercial Bills
Purchase and discounting of commercial bills is a way by which
banks provide funds for working capital required by commerce, trade and
industry. The financial instrument trading in the bills market is the bill
of exchange. It is a written instrument containing unconditional order
signed by the maker, directing to pay a certain amount of money to a
particular person, or to the bearer of the instrument. It is a negotiable self-
liquidating instrument with low degree of risk. Its liquidity is exceeded
only by T-bills, call loans and cash, in that order. The spread between the
face value of the bill and ready cash paid is the discount rate. Till the bill
164Notes
matures, the banks can use the same process of discounting to get ready
cash. The eligibility criterion is that the bill should arise out of a genuine
trade transaction and the maturity period should fall within 90 days from
the date of discounting.
g) Term Money
RBI has permitted some of the Financial Institutions like IDBI,
ICICI, IFCI, HBI, SIDBI, NABARD, EXIM-Bank etc. to borrow from the
market for a period of 3 months and up to a period of not more than 6
months within the stipulated limits. The rate of interest on the term money
is determined between the parties by mutual negotiation. The investment
in term money is unsecured and the limits are fixed by RBI. The term
money is accepted by their institutions at a discounted value. On the due
date the payment will be equal to the face value of the instrument, which
for all purpose consists of term deposit receipt.
h) Bank Deposits
The banks are permitted to keep deposits with other banks for a
period of 15 days and above. The rate of interest of such deposits is freely
determined by the two banks between themselves through negotiations.
These deposits are not reckoned for the purpose of cash reserve ratio (CRR)
requirements. Like the call/notice money transactions, the transactions
relating to the bank deposit is evidenced by way of deposit receipt. These
deposits are not transferable, but they could be prematurely closed at the
discretion of the lender.
i) Bankers Acceptance
A banker’s acceptance is a draft against a bank ordering the bank
to pay some specified amount at a future date. The banker’s acceptance is
very safe security and is used as a money market instrument.
j) Fringe Market
The fringe market is a disorganized money market, deemed to
include everything that is outside the scope of the money market (i.e.,
the institutional money market). The fringe market includes activities like
165Notes
the Inter-Corporate Deposit (ICD) market, small scale trade financing,
financing of investments in the stock market, discounting and lending
against lOUs or promissory notes, etc. The ICDs market is the most visible
feature of the fringe market. As its name indicates it essentially involves
short-term borrowing and lending of funds amongst the corporations.
Generally the fringe market exist, wherever the main borrowers and lenders
of the funds are based, i.e., at the location of the industrial, corporate and
trading establishments. The interest rates at which the funds can be lent in
the fringe market are generally higher than those operating in the money
market. The risk level of the fringe market is higher because the people
who borrow at exorbitant rates are the ones who are most likely to default.
k) Call Money Market
Call money refers to that transaction which is received or delivered
by the participants in the call money market and where the funds are
returnable next day. The call money transactions are also referred to as
overnight funds. Notice money on the other hand is a transaction where
the participants will take time to receive or deliver for more than two
days but generally for a maximum of fourteen days. In both the cases the
transaction is unsecured. Therefore, as a prudential measure, a counter-
party exposure limits are listed according to which the lender lends money.
In short, resorting to the call/notice money transactions reflect
temporary mismatch of funds during the short period of one to fourteen
days. The participants, who have surplus, lend their money to shed the
mismatch for the relative period. The participants, who are short of funds,
would borrow funds for the relative period. The rate at which the funds
will be deployed or borrowed will be determined on the basis of the market
conditions at a given point of time. When the market is highly liquid,
the funds would be easily available where as the funds will be difficult to
obtain in a tight money market conditions.
The rates are low in an easy money or liquid market and the rates
would be high in a tight money market. A liquid market may fluctuate
even overnight due to sudden changes in the financial environment,
change in policy of the central monetary authority or the Government
or even due to any other external factor which has an implication on
the financial market. The document by which the call/notice money are
166Notes
carried out is the call/ notice money receipt which is exchanged against
Banker’s Cheque/Reserve Bank Cheque. The following day or on a day
fixed according to the notice, the reversal takes place by repayment from
the borrower to the lender against return of the call/notice money receipt
duly discharged by the lender.
Capital Market
Definition of Capital Market
It is a place where people buy and sell financial instruments be it
equity or debt. It is a mechanism to facilitate the exchange of financial assets.
The capital market includes primary and secondary markets. Examples of
secondary markets in India include BSE& NSE which constitute majority
of the capital market transactions. At international level, we have NYSE,
LSE & TSE, which are the major Stock Exchanges. More details about
primary and secondary markets are covered in Unit IV.
Significance of Capital Markets
A well-functioning stock market may help the development process
in an economy through the following channels:
➢ ➢ 
Growth of savings.
➢ ➢ 
Efficient allocation of investment resources.
➢ ➢ 
Better utilization of the existing resources.
In market economy like India, financial market institutions provide
the avenue by which long-term savings are mobilized and channeled into
investments. Confidence of the investors in the market is imperative for the
growth and development of the market. For any stock market, the market
Indices is the barometer of its performance and reflects the prevailing
sentiments of the entire economy. Stock index is created to provide
investors with the information regarding the average share price in the
stock market. The ups and downs in the index represent the movement of
the equity market. These indices need to represent the return obtained by
typical portfolios in the country. Generally, the stock price of any company
is vulnerable to three types of news such as Company specific, Industry
specific and Economy specific. An all-share index includes stocks from all
167Notes
the sectors of the economy and thus cancels out the stock and sector specific
news and events that affect stock prices (law of portfolio diversification)
and reflect the overall performance of the company/equity market and the
news affecting it.
The most important use of an equity market index is as a benchmark
for a portfolio of stocks. All diversified portfolios, belonging either to retail
investors or mutual funds, use the common stock index as a yardstick
for their returns. Indices are useful in modern financial application of
derivatives.
Capital Market Instruments and Participants
The capital market is a place where long term funds are
borrowed and lent. Capital Market Instruments include Equity, Preference
shares, Debenture/ Bonds, ADRs/ GDRs and Derivatives. In the equity
segment: we have equity shares, preference shares, convertible preference
shares, non-convertible preference shares, etc. In the debt segment: we
have debentures, zero coupon bonds, deep discount bonds, etc. Section
85 of the Companies Act, 1956 permits public limited companies (having
share capital) to have two kinds of shares namely - equity and preference.
Apart from the traditional securities, we have lot of innovative (eg. Sweat
equity shares) and hybrid instruments which are coming up in the market.
More details about the equity and debt instruments are covered in Unit IV.
The foreign capital by way of issue of American Depository Receipts and
Global Depository Receipts are covered in Unit V.
Another market we have is a derivative market. A derivative
is a financial instrument, whose value depends on the values of basic
underlying variable. In the sense, derivatives is a financial instrument
that offers return based on the return of some other underlying asset, i.e
the return is derived from another instrument. For example, derivatives
that can be structured around any uncertainty. Stock prices are uncertain
- Lot of forwards, options or futures contracts are based on movements
in prices of individual stocks or groups of stocks; Prices of commodities
are uncertain - There are forwards, futures and options on commodities;
Interest rates are uncertain - There are interest rate swaps and futures;
Foreign exchange rates are uncertain - There are exchange rate derivatives;
and Weather is uncertain - There are weather derivatives, and so on.
168Notes
Financial derivatives are financial instruments whose prices are
derived from the prices of other financial instruments. Although financial
derivatives have existed for a considerable period of time, they have become
a major force in financial markets only since the early 1970s. In the class
of equity derivatives, futures and options on stock indices have gained
more popularity than on individual stocks, especially among institutional
investors, who are major users of index-linked derivatives. Even small
investors find these useful due to high correlation of the popular indices
with various portfolios and ease of use. Derivative contracts have several
variants. Depending upon the market in which they are traded, derivatives
are classified as 1) exchange traded and 2) over the counter. The most
common variants are forwards, futures, options and swaps.
Securities market in India has grown exponentially as measured in
terms of amount raised from the market, number of stock exchanges and
other intermediaries, the number of listed stocks, market capitalization,
trading volumes and turnover on stock exchanges and investor population.
Along with this, the profiles of the investors, issuers and intermediaries have
changed significantly. The market has witnessed fundamental institutional
changes resulting in drastic reduction in transaction costs and significant
improvements in efficiency, transparency and safety. Indian market is now
comparable to many developed markets.
History of Indian Capital Market
The history of the capital market in India dates back to the
eighteenth century when East India Company securities were traded in
the country. Until the end of the nineteenth century, securities trading
were unorganized and the main trading centres were Bombay (now
Mumbai) and Calcutta (now Kolkata). Of the two, Bombay was the chief
trading centre wherein bank shares were the major trading stock. During
the American Civil War (1860-61), Bombay was an important source of
supply for cotton. Hence, trading activities flourished during the period,
resulting in a boom in share prices. This boom, the first in the history of
the Indian capital market, lasted for a half a decade. The first joint stock
company was established on 1850. The bubble burst on July 1, 1865, when
there was tremendous slump in share prices. Trading was at that time
limited to a dozen brokers, their trading place was under a banyan tree
in front of the Town Hall in Bombay. These stockbrokers organized an
169Notes
informal association in 1875-Native Shares and Stock Brokers Association,
Bombay. The stock exchanges in Calcutta and Ahmadabad, also industrial
and trading centres came up later. The Bombay Stock Exchange was
recognized in May 1927 under the Bombay Securities Contracts Control
Act, 1925. The capital market was not well organized and developed during
the British rule because the British government was not interested in the
economic growth of the country. As a result, many foreign companies
depended on the London capital market for funds rather than on the
Indian capital market.
In the post-independence period also, the size of the capital
market remained small. During the first and second five-year plans, the
government‘s emphasis was on the development of the agricultural sector
and public sector undertakings. The public sector undertakings were
healthier than the private undertakings in terms of paid-up capital but
their shares were not listed on the stock exchanges. Moreover, the then
Controller of Capital Issues (CCI) closely supervised and controlled the
timing composition, interest rates, pricing, allotment, and floatation costs
of new issues. These strict regulations de-motivated many companies from
going public for almost four and a half decades.
In the 1950s, Century Textiles, Tata Steel, Bombay Dyeing, National
Rayon, and Kohinoor Mills were the favourite scripts of speculators.
As speculation became rampant, the stock market came to be known as
Satta Bazaar‘. Despite speculation, non-payment or defaults were not very
frequent. The government enacted the Securities Contracts (Regulation)
Act in 1956.It was also characterized by the establishment of a network for
the development of financial institutions and state financial corporations.
The 1960s was characterized by wars and droughts in the country which
led to bearish trends. These trends were aggravated by the ban in 1969 on
forward trading and badla, technically called contracts for clearing. ‘Badla’
provided a mechanism for carrying forward positions as well as borrowing
funds.
Financial institutions such as LIC and GIC helped to revive the
sentiment by emerging as the most important group of investors. The first
mutual fund of India, the Unit Trust of India (UTI) came into existence in
1964. In the 1970s, badla trading was resumed under the disguised from of
hand-delivery contracts-A group. This revived the market. However, the
170Notes
capital market received another severe setback on July 6, 1974 when the
government promulgated the Dividend Restriction Ordinance, restricting
the payment of dividend by companies. This led to a slump in market
capitalization at the BSE by about 20 per cent overnight and the stock
market did not open for nearly a fortnight.
Later the buoyancy in the stock markets when the multinational
companies (MNCs) were forced to dilute their majority stocks in their
Indian ventures in favour of the Indian public under FERA, 1973. Several
MNCs opted out of India. One under and twenty-three MNCs offered
shares were lower than their intrinsic worth. Hence, for the first time, the
FERA dilution created an equity cult in India. It was the spate of FERA
issues that gave a real fillip to the Indian stock markets. For the first time,
many investors got an opportunity to invest in the stocks of such MNCs
as Colgate, and Hindustan Liver Limited. Then, in 1977, a little – known
entrepreneur, Dhirubhai Ambani, tapped the capital market. The scrip,
reliance textiles, is still a hot favourite and dominates trading at all stock
exchanges.
The 1980s witnessed an explosive growth of the securities market
in India with millions of investors suddenly discovering lucrative
opportunities. Many investors jumped into the stock markets for the first
time. The government’s liberalisation process initiated during the mid-
1980s, spurred this growth. Participation by small investors, speculation,
defaults ban on badla, and resumption of badla continued. Convertible
debentures emerged as a popular instrument of resource mobilization
in the primary market. The introduction of public sector bonds and the
successful mega issues of Reliance Petrochemicals and Larsen and Toubro
gave a new lease of life to the primary market. This, in turn, enlarged
volumes in the secondary market. The decade of the 1980s was characterized
by an increase in the number of stock exchanges, listed companies, paid
up-capital, and market capitalization.
The 1990s will go down as the most important decade in the
history of the capital market of India. Liberalisation and globalization
were the new terms coined and marketed during the decade. The Capital
Issues (Control) Act, 1947 was repealed in May 1992. The decade was
characterized by a new industrial policy, emergence of SEBI as a regulator
of capital market, advent of foreign institutional investors, euro-issues, free
171Notes
pricing, new trading practices, new stock exchanges, entry of new players
such as private sector mutual funds and private sector banks, and primary
market boom and bust.12 Major capital market scams took place in the
1990s. These shook the capital market and drove away small investors
from the market. The securities scam of March, 1992 involving brokers as
well as bankers was one of the biggest scams in the history of the capital
market. In the subsequent years owing to free pricing, many unscrupulous
promoters, who raised money from the capital market, proved to be fly-
by-night operators. This led to erosion in the investors’ confidence. The M
S Shoes case, one such scam which took place in March 1995, put a break
on new issue activity.
The 1991-1992 securities scam revealed the inadequacies’ of and
inefficiencies in the financial system. It was the scam, which prompted
a reform of the equity market. The Indian stock market witnessed a sea
change in terms of technology and market prices. Technology brought
radical changes in the trading mechanism. The Bombay Stock Exchange
was subject to nationwide competition by two new stock exchanges-the
National Stock Exchange, set up in 1994, and Over the Counter Exchange
of India, set up in 1992. The National Securities Clearing Corporation
(NSCC) and National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL) were set up
in April 1995 and November 1996 respectively from improved clearing
and settlement and dematerialized trading. The Securities Contracts
(Regulation) Act, 1956 was amended in 1995-96 for introduction of
options trading. Moreover, rolling settlement was introduced in January
1998 for the dematerialized segment of all companies. With automation
and geographical spread, stock market participation increased.
In the late 1990s, the Information Technology (IT) scrips were
dominant on the Indian bourses. These scrips included Infosys, Wipro,
and Satyam. They were a part of the favourite scrips of the period, also
known as New Economy scrips, along with telecommunications and media
scrips. The new economy companies are knowledge intensive unlike the
old economy companies that were asset intensive. The Indian capital
market entered the twenty-first century with the Ketan Parekh scam. As
a result of this scam, Badla was discontinued from July 2001 and rolling
settlement was introduced in all scrips. Trading of futures commenced
from June 2000, and Internet trading was permitted in February 2000. On
July 2, 2001, the Unit Trust of India announced suspension of the sale and
172Notes
repurchase of its flagship US-64 scheme due to heavy redemption leading
to panic on the bourses. The government‘s decision to privatize oil PSUs
in 2003 fuelled stock prices. One big divestment of international telephony
major VSNL took place in early February 2002.
Foreign institutional investors have emerged as major players on
the Indian bourses. NSE has an upper hand over its reveal BSE in terms
of volumes not only in the equity markets but also in the derivatives
market. It has been a long journey for the Indian capital market. Now
the capital market is organized, fairly integrated, mature, more global
and modernized. The Indian equity market is one of the best in the world
in terms of technology. Advances in computer and communications
technology coming together on Internet are shattering geographic
boundaries and enlarging the investor class. Internet trading has become a
global phenomenon. The Indian stock markets are now getting integrated
with global markets.
Banking Legislations in India
Evolution of Legislative Regulation of Banking in India
In the very early phase of commercial banking in India, the
regulatory framework was somewhat diffused and the Presidency
Banks were regulated and governed by their Royal Charter, the East
India Company and the Government of India of that time. Though the
Company law was introduced in India way back in 1850, it did not apply
to the banking companies. The banking crisis of 1913, however, had
revealed several weaknesses in the Indian banking system, such as the low
proportion of liquid assets of the banks and connected lending practices,
resulting in large-scale bank failures.
The recommendations of the Indian Central Banking Enquiry
Committee (1929-31), which looked into the issue of bank failures, paved
the way for legislation for banking regulation in the country. Though
the RBI, as part of its monetary management mandate, had, from the
very beginning, been vested with the powers, under the RBI Act, 1934,
to regulate the volume and cost of bank credit in the economy through
the instruments of general credit control, it was not until 1949 that a
comprehensive enactment, applicable only to the banking sector, came into
173Notes
existence. Prior to 1949, the banking companies, in common with other
companies, were governed by the Indian Companies Act, 1913, which
itself was a comprehensive re-enactment of the earlier company law of
1850. This Act, however, contained a few provisions especially applicable
to banks.
There were also a few ad hoc enactments, such as the Banking
Companies (Inspection) Ordinance, 1946, and the Banking Companies
(Restriction of Branches) Act, 1946, covering specific regulatory aspects.
In this backdrop, in March 1949, a special legislation, called the Banking
Companies Act, 1949, applicable exclusively to the banking companies,
was passed; this Act was renamed as the Banking Regulation Act from
March 1966. The Act vested in the Reserve Bank the responsibility relating
to licensing of banks, branch expansion, and liquidity of their assets,
management and methods of working, amalgamation, reconstruction and
liquidation. Important changes in several provisions of the Act were made
from time to time, designed to enlarge or amplify the responsibilities of
the RBI or to impart flexibility to the relative provisions, commensurate
with the imperatives of the banking sector developments.
It is interesting to note that till March 1966, the Reserve Bank had
practically no role in relation to the functioning of the urban co-operative
banks. However, by the enactment of the Banking Laws (Application
to Co-operative Societies) Act, 1965, certain provisions of the Banking
Regulation Act, regarding the matters relating to banking business, were
extended to the urban co-operative banks also. Thus, for the first time
in 1966, the urban co-operative banks too came within the regulatory
purview of the RBI.

Regulation and Supervision
Regulation and supervision of the financial system has received
renewed focus in recent years in the context of the phenomenal expansion
of the financial sector, technology-enabled innovations in financial
products and deepening of global integration. The strategic importance of
the banks in the financial system make it imperative for the central bank
–historically, the lender of the last resort and the supervisor of the banking
system - to pursue financial stability as an important macroeconomic
objective, although, in India, there are separate institutions (viz., the SEBI
and the IRDA) to oversee the functioning of individual segments of the
financial system.
A number of initiatives have been taken by the Reserve Bank in
reorienting the supervisory and regulatory framework and aligning it
175Notes
with the international best practices, while providing sufficient flexibility
to the financial institutions to respond to the growing competition and
taking advantage of the business opportunities unfolded by technological
advancements.
➢ ➢ 
Narasimham Committee II made a range of recommendations for
improving the vigour of the banking system (capital adequacy, asset
quality, nonperforming assets, etc.) as also for strengthening the
supervisory systems.
➢ ➢ 
The Committee observed that the issue of ‘autonomous status’ for
the Board for Financial Supervision (BFS) of the Reserve Bank
should be considered to segregate the regulatory and supervisory
functions of the apex bank. The Committee made specific
recommendations to restructure the BFS and to set up a separate
Board for Financial Regulation and Supervision (BFRS).
➢ ➢ 
The committee also highlighted the need for a review of banking
sector laws, such as, the RBI Act, the Banking Regulation Act,
the Nationalization Act and the State Bank of India Act. The
recommendations made by the Committee are being progressively
implemented.
➢ ➢ 
Following the recommendations of the Narasimham Committee II
and more recently in the context of the Basel II Accord, the Reserve
Bank has taken several measures to strengthen its regulatory and
supervisory framework with a view to ensuring a sound, efficient
and vibrant financial system in the country.
➢ ➢ 
The measures to contain the level of nonperforming assets
(NPAs) include the setting up of Debt Recovery Tribunals for
expeditious adjudication and recovery of debts due to banks and
financial institutions, LokAdalats (people’s courts) and Asset
Reconstruction Companies and Corporate Debt Restructuring
(CDR) mechanisms.
➢ ➢ 
In order to ensure the functioning of institutions and markets on the
basis of informed decisions, the Reserve Bank has issued guidelines
to banks to enhance the level of transparency and disclosures with
regard to their financial position.
176Notes
➢ ➢ 
Bank regulation is increasingly getting risk based with the
realization that the traditional supervisory practices were out of
step with the sophisticated risk management techniques.
➢ ➢ 
The International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital
Standards: A Revised Framework (popularly known as Basel II) has
brought regulation and risk management to the center stage.
➢ ➢ 
Basel II rests on three pillars: minimum capital requirements,
supervisory review process and market discipline. India has
decided that all the commercial banks would have to be Basel II
compliant by adopting, at a minimum, the Standardized Approach
for credit risk and Basic Indicator Approach for operational risk
under Pillar 1. As regards the supervisory review process (Pillar
2), the role of supervisors is to evaluate whether or not the banks
are assessing their capital requirements properly in relation to their
risks and if necessary the supervisors may intervene to mandate a
higher capital requirement. As regards Pillar 3, the Reserve Bank
has been advising banks to make disclosures in order to enhance
market discipline.
➢ ➢ 
A view has been expressed in certain quarters that the Indian
regulatory framework should migrate to principles-based regulation
from the current rules-based approach.
➢ ➢ 
The Basel III framework introduces a paradigm shift in capital
and liquidity standards, which was constructed and agreed to in
relatively record time. Basel III proposals have two main objectives:
➢ ➢ 
To strengthen global capital and liquidity regulations with the
goal of promoting and a more resilient banking sector.
➢ ➢ 
To improve the banking sector ability to absorb shocks arising
from financial and economic stress, this, in turn, would reduce
the risk of a spillover from the financial sector to the real
economy.
➢ ➢ 
To achieve these objectives the Basel III proposals are broken down
into three parts on the basis of the main areas they address: Capital
reform (including quality and quantity of capital, complete risk
coverage, leverage ratio and the introduction of capital conservation
buffers, and a counter cyclical capital buffer); Liquidity reform
177Notes
(short term and long term ratios); and other elements relating to
general improvements to the stability of the financial system)
Conclusion
The Indian regulatory regime for the banking sector has come a
long way over the past six decades. The current regulatory dispensation is
ownership neutral, nondiscriminatory and provides a level playing field
for the market participants. There is considerable scope for improvements
in the regulatory systems in India and we have been pursuing a policy
of constant improvements through a participative and consultative
approach with market participants. The policy outcomes so far, in terms

CASE STUDY
Commercial Papers – An Innovative Money Market Instrument
Commercial Paper (CP) is a short-term negotiable money market
instrument used by Financial Institutions and Corporations to source
funds from the public. The base rate system which came into force on July 1,
2010, in India brought about drastic changes in the Commercial Paper(CP)
market in the country. Under this system, banks were not supposed to lend
below the base rate. Market analysts noted, "The introduction of the so-
called base rate, below which no bank could lend since July 2010, would
give a leg up to the commercial paper market in India. Corporations and
Non-Banking Finance Companies (NBFCs) would prefer to utilize the
CP for short-term funding needs". Under base rate system, the cost of
commercial paper worked out to be cheaper than the bank borrowing rate
as the borrowers were no longer in a position to negotiate on the lending
rate with banks. The banking system had earlier been using the Prime
Lending Rate (PLR) for the best rated customers. Borrowers often took
undue advantage of the system and took loans for short-term periods at
a minimal rate of interest. This led to a situation where the banks were
forced to quote competitive, lower rates of interest to retain customers.
This posed a serious threat to the profitability of the banks. Subsequently,
RBI introduced the “Benchmark Prime Lending Rate System” (BPLR)
in place of PLR. It made banks quote BPLR, based on its affordability of
179Notes
credit. The BPLR was arrived at after taking into account four important
components like average cost of deposits, operating expenses, probable
loan losses, and a profit margin. Despite these guidelines, the bargaining
power of the well-rated borrower forced banks to quote sub-PLR/BPLR
rates, to withstand the competition. About 70% of loans to well-rated
companies were estimated to have been sanctioned at below PLR/BPLR
rates. These practices were cutting into the profit of the banks. Keeping
this in view, RBI advised the banks to quote a base rate and to not finance
any borrower below this rate. From the month of July 2010, the banks were
not allowed to lend below the base rate. Since July 2010, the base rates
quoted by the banks were in the range 8.5% to 9.5%. Hence, companies
found it difficult to raise credit facilities at a lower rate of interest through
the banking system. Commercial Paper appeared to be a better alternate
source of finance.
Question
1. Is commercial paper a better alternate source of finance? Analyse.

Introduction
Development Banks or Development Financial Institutions (DFIs)
were established mainly to provide long-term capital for industry and
agriculture. It had been found that commercial banks, by the short-term
nature of their deposits which they mobilize, were in a position to grant
only short-term credit to industry and agriculture to meet their working
capital requirements. An attempt was made, initially in Germany, to start
industrial banks or mixed banks as they were commonly called to give
long term credit to industry and these banks had a fair amount of success
in the industrialization of Germany.
But in developing countries like India it was not possible to have
mixed banking, even though there was a great demand for such institutions
to finance economic growth. The basic reason for this was that banking
182Notes
habit has not fully developed and that commercial banks could not take
heavy risks by freezing short-term depositor’s money in long-term and
medium-term loans to industry and agriculture.
It was in this context that the Government of India established a
number of institutions since independence to provide long-term finance to
industry, trade and agriculture. The Government of India along with RBI
and the banking system set up IFCI, SFCs, ICICI, IDBI, IRBI, Unit Trust of
India, LIC and GIC. All these institutions provide finance for industries.
Then we have Export-Import Bank (EXIM Bank) which specializes
in international trade, the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural
Development (NABARD), the Shipping Credit and Investment Company
Ltd to finance shipping and fishing industries, etc. These institutions were
called development banks or public sector financial institutions. They are
now referred to as development finance institutions (DFIs).
Structure of Industrial and Agricultural Banking System in India
The Indian agricultural and industrial banking system has travelled
a lot and many changes have happened in tune with the requirements of
the industry, trade, agriculture and other specialized sectors. The financial
institutions which help industry, agriculture and other sectors in India
can be classified into five categories and they consist of the following
institutions.

Role of Industrial Finance Corporation of India (IFCI)
Genesis of IFCI
At the time of independence in 1947, India’s capital market was
relatively under-developed. Although there was significant demand
for new capital, there was a dearth of providers. Merchant bankers and
underwriting firms were almost non-existent and commercial banks were
not equipped to provide long-term industrial finance in any significant
manner. It is against this backdrop that the government established The
Industrial Finance Corporation of India (IFCI) on July 1, 1948, as the first
Development Financial Institution (DFI) in the country to cater to the
long-term finance needs of the industrial sector. The newly-established
DFI was provided access to low-cost funds through the central bank’s
Statutory Liquidity Ratio or SLR which in turn enabled it to provide loans
and advances to corporate borrowers at concessional rates.
Liberalization - Conversion into Company in 1993
By the early 1990s, it was recognized that there was need for greater
flexibility to respond to the changing financial system. It was also felt that
IFCI should directly access the capital markets for its funds needs. It is
with this objective that the constitution of IFCI was changed in 1993 from
a statutory corporation to a company under the Indian Companies Act,
1956. Subsequently, the name of the company was also changed to “IFCI
Limited” with effect from October 1999.
Corporate Strategy
IFCI has been able to achieve a financial turnaround with the
consistent support and cooperation of all its stakeholders and is now
endeavouring to re-position itself. In addition to its core competence in
long term lending to industrial and infrastructure sectors, IFCI aims to
enhance its organizational value through better realization of its Non-
performing Assets (NPAs) and unlocking of value of its investment
portfolio including unquoted investments as well as real estate assets.
185Notes
Indian Economy and IFCI
Until the establishment of ICICI in 1956 and IDBI in 1964, IFCI
remained solely responsible for implementation of the Government’s
industrial policy initiatives. It made a significant contribution to the
modernization of Indian industry, export promotion, import substitution,
pollution control, energy conservation and generation through
commercially viable and market-friendly initiatives. Some sectors that
have directly benefited from IFCI include:
➢ ➢ 
Agro-based industry (textiles, paper, sugar)
➢ ➢ 
Service industry (hotels, hospitals)
➢ ➢ 
Basic industry (iron & steel, fertilizers, basic chemicals, cement)
➢ ➢ 
Capital & intermediate goods industry (electronics, synthetic fibres,
synthetic plastics, miscellaneous chemicals) and Infrastructure
(power generation, telecom services)
IFCI’s Economic Contribution
IFCI’s economic contribution can be measured from the following:
1. By way of illustration, IFCI’s assistance has been helped to create
production capacities of 6.5 million spindles in the textile industry,
7.2 million tons per annum (tpa) of sugar production, million tpa
of paper and paper products, 18.5 million tpa of fertilizers, 59.3
million tpa of cement, 30.2 million tpa of iron and steel, 32.8 million
tpa of petroleum refining, 14,953 MW of electricity, 22,106 hotel
rooms, 5,544 hospital beds, 8 port projects, 66 telecom projects and
1 bridge project.
2. The direct employment generated as a result of its financial
assistance is estimated at almost 1 million persons.
3. IFCI has played a key role in the development of cooperatives in
the sugar and textile sectors, besides acting as a nodal agency in
both sectors. 371 cooperative societies in these sectors have been
assisted by IFCI.
4. IFCI has promoted Technical Consultancy Organizations (TCOs),
primarily in less developed states to provide necessary services to the
186Notes
promoters of small and medium-sized industries in collaboration
with other banks and institutions.
5. IFCI has also provided assistance to self-employed youth and
women entrepreneurs under its Benevolent Reserve Fund (BRF)
and the Interest Differential Fund (IDF).
6. IFCI has founded and developed prominent institutions like:
➢ ➢ 
Management Development Institute (MDI) for management
training and development
➢ ➢ 
ICRA for credit assessment rating
➢ ➢ 
Tourism Finance Corporation of India (TFCI) for promotion
of the hotel and tourism industry
➢ ➢ 
Institute of Leadership Development (ILD) for rehabilitation
and training of displaced and retrenched labor force.
➢ ➢ 
Rashtriya Gramin Vikas Nidhi (RGVN) for promoting,
supporting and developing voluntary agencies engaged in
uplifting rural and urban poor in east and northeast India.
7. IFCI, along with other institutions, has also promoted:
➢ ➢ 
Stock Holding Corporation of India Ltd. (SHCIL)
➢ ➢ 
Discount and Finance House of India Ltd. (DFHI)
➢ ➢ 
National Stock Exchange (NSE)
➢ ➢ 
Over the Counter Exchange of India (OTCEI)
➢ ➢ 
Securities Trading Corporation of India (STCI)
➢ ➢ 
LIC Housing Finance Ltd.
➢ ➢ 
GIC Housing Finance Ltd. and
➢ ➢ 
Biotech Consortium India Ltd. (BCIL).
8. IFCI has also set up Chairs in reputed educational/management
institutions and universities.
9. A major contribution of IFCI has been in the early assistance
provided by it to some of today’s leading Indian entrepreneurs who
may not have been able to start their enterprises or expand without
the initial support from IFCI.

Role of Industrial Credit Investment Corporation of India
(Erstwhile ICICI) – (Now ICICI Bank - Private Sector Bank)
History of Erstwhile ICICI
The Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India Limited
(ICICI) incorporated in the year 1955, at the initiative of the World Bank,
the Government of India and representatives of Indian industry, with the
objective of creating a development financial institution for providing
medium-term and long-term project financing to Indian businesses.
Mr.A.Ramaswami Mudaliar elected as the first Chairman of ICICI
Limited. ICICI emerged as the major source of foreign currency loans to
Indian industry. Besides funding from the World Bank and other multi-
lateral agencies, ICICI was also among the first Indian companies to raise
funds from international markets. As a result of nationalization of major
commercial banks and insurance companies (which were the shareholders
of ICICI) in 1969, over 80 percent of its issued share capital was held by
public sector corporations. Despite the majority public sector shareholding
until the 1990, ICICI maintained the dynamism of a private sector DFI.
Because of the high growth in operations and with the development of the
capital market, ICICI increased equity, as well as domestic and international
borrowing, and changed its shareholding pattern. In 1991/92 ICICI made
a right-cum-public share issue of ` 1 billion. This resulted in the decline of
the share of the public sector and the increase of individual holders.
Scope of Operations of Erstwhile ICICI
ICICI’s operational activities consisted mainly of extending
medium- and long-term loans in local and foreign currencies to assist in
the creation, expansion, and modernization of medium and large industrial
enterprises, predominantly in the private sector. ICICI had played a key role
in providing foreign exchange financing. It also makes equity investments,
underwrites new shares and debenture issues, and guarantees loans from
other investment sources. Since the early 1980s, as a part of its strategy to
provide various forms of assistance to industry, ICICI had diversified its
activities to cover financial services, such as leasing and deferred credit.
As the Indian economy began to be liberalized in the early 1990s, ICICI
needed to become a financial supermarket by offering a wide range of
financial services to cope with growing opportunities and competition.
188Notes
ICICI entered new areas of business, such as commercial banking and
asset management, and expanded its existing businesses, for example,
merchant banking services, which include capital issue management. For
regulatory and strategic reasons, specialized subsidiaries were established
for the following activities: investment banking, commercial banking,
fund management, investor services, and broking.
In addition, ICICI had diversified its own range of activities into
several fee-based services, including custodial services to cater to the needs
of foreign and domestic institutional investors. To facilitate the globalization
of Indian industry, ICICI had established new divisions to advise Indian
corporations planning to establish operations abroad and foreign
companies looking for local partners. ICICI also provided technology
financing for development and commercialization of technology. ICICI
had already played a key role in the infrastructure sector by providing
advisory services to the Central Government and state governments and
to government agencies in the power and telecommunications sectors, and
has sanctioned $486 million for projects mainly in power and ports.
Emergence of ICICI Bank
ICICI Bank was originally promoted in 1994 by ICICI Limited,
an Indian developmental financial institution, and was its wholly-owned
subsidiary. ICICI’s shareholding in ICICI Bank was reduced to 46% through
a public offering of shares in India in fiscal 1998, an equity offering in the
form of ADRs listed on the NYSE in fiscal 2000, ICICI Bank’s acquisition of
Bank of Madura Limited in an all-stock amalgamation in fiscal 2001, and
secondary market sales by ICICI to institutional investors in fiscal 2001
and fiscal 2002. ICICI was formed in 1955 at the initiative of the World
Bank, the Government of India and representatives of Indian industry.
The principal objective was to create a development financial institution
for providing medium-term and long-term project financing to Indian
businesses.
In the 1990s, ICICI transformed its business from a development
financial institution offering only project finance to a diversified financial
services group offering a wide variety of products and services, both
directly and through a number of subsidiaries and affiliates like ICICI
Bank. In 1999, ICICI become the first Indian company and the first bank
or financial institution from non-Japan Asia to be listed on the NYSE.
189Notes
Reverse Merger of ICICI with ICICI Bank
After consideration of various corporate structuring alternatives
in the context of the emerging competitive scenario in the Indian banking
industry, and the move towards universal banking, the managements of
ICICI and ICICI Bank formed the view that the merger of ICICI with ICICI
Bank would be the optimal strategic alternative for both entities, and would
create the optimal legal structure for the ICICI group’s universal banking
strategy. The merger would enhance value for ICICI shareholders through
the merged entity’s access to low-cost deposits, greater opportunities for
earning fee-based income and the ability to participate in the payments
system and provide transaction-banking services. The merger would
enhance value for ICICI Bank shareholders through a large capital base
and scale of operations, seamless access to ICICI’s strong corporate
relationships built up over five decades, entry into new business segments,
higher market share in various business segments, particularly fee-based
services, and access to the vast talent pool of ICICI and its subsidiaries.
In October 2001, the Boards of Directors of ICICI and ICICI
Bank approved the merger of ICICI and two of its wholly-owned retail
finance subsidiaries, ICICI Personal Financial Services Limited and ICICI
Capital Services Limited, with ICICI Bank. The merger was approved
by shareholders of ICICI and ICICI Bank in January 2002, by the High
Court of Gujarat at Ahmedabad in March 2002, and by the High Court
of Judicature at Mumbai and the Reserve Bank of India in April 2002.
Consequent to the merger, the ICICI group’s financing and banking
operations, both wholesale and retail, have been integrated in a single
entity.
Profile of ICICI Bank
ICICI Bank is India’s second-largest bank with total assets of
` 4,736.47 billion (US$ 93 billion) at March 31, 2012 and profit after tax
` 64.65 billion (US$ 1,271 million) for the year ended March 31, 2012.
The Bank has a network of 2,899 branches and 10,021 ATMs in India,
and has a presence in 19 countries, including India. ICICI Bank offers a

branches in Belgium and Germany. ICICI Bank’s equity shares are listed
in India on Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange of
India Limited and its American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) are listed on
the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).

Banking Group that offers a comprehensive range of financial products
and services in the areas of commercial banking, investment banking,
asset management, venture capital, state level infrastructure financing,

Role of Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) (Erstwhile IDBI)
– (Now IDBI Bank Ltd. – Other Public Sector Bank Category)
Brief History of IDBI
Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) was established
in 1964 by the Government of India (GoI) under an Act of Parliament,
the Industrial Development Bank of India Act, 1964 (the IDBI Act), as a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to provide credit
and extend other facilities for the development of industry. In 1976, the
ownership of IDBI was transferred to the GOI and it was entrusted with the
additional responsibility of acting as the principal financial institution for
coordinating the activities of institutions engaged in financing, promotion
or development of industry.
Over the last four decades, IDBI’s role as catalyst to industrial
development has encompassed a broad spectrum of activities. IDBI had
extended finance to all types of industrial concerns covered under the
provisions of the IDBl Act irrespective of the size or form or sector of
organization. IDBI primarily provided finance to large and medium
industrial enterprises engaged or to be engaged in the manufacture,
processing or preservation of goods, mining, shipping, transport, hotel
industry, information technology, medical and health, leasing generation
and distribution of power; maintenance, repair, testing, servicing of
vehicles; setting up of industrial estates as also in the research and
development for promotion of industrial growth.
IDBI had also been assigned a special role for co-coordinating the
activities of institutions engaged in financing, promoting or developing
industries. In the past, the GOI had provided direct and indirect financial
assistance and support to IDBI including access to low cost funds and
assistance by way of restructuring of high cost liabilities. Though GOI has
no legal obligation to provide financial assistance or extend support to
IDBI, it had done so from time to time considering the unique role assigned
to IDBI in the industrial development of the country. The structural
changes in the industrial sector including the opening up of the economy
and the ongoing disintermediation in the financial sector had changed
the credit profile of IDBI. The sources and availability of cheap long term
funds declined resulting in difficulties in operations as a standalone DFI.
192Notes
Industrial Development Bank of India Limited
In response to the felt need and on commercial prudence, it was
decided to transform IDBI into a Bank. For the purpose, Industrial
Development bank (transfer of undertaking and Repeal) Act, 2003 [Repeal
Act] was passed repealing the Industrial Development Bank of India Act,
1964. In terms of the provisions of the Repeal Act, a new company under
the name of Industrial Development Bank of India Limited (IDBI Ltd.)
was incorporated as a Govt. Company under the Companies Act, 1956 on
September 27, 2004. Thereafter, the undertaking of IDBI was transferred
to and vested in IDBI Ltd. with effect from the effective date of October
01, 2004. In terms of the provisions of the Repeal Act, IDBI Ltd. has
been functioning as a Bank in addition to its earlier role of a Financial
Institution.
Merger of IDBI Bank with IDBI
To create a more conducive environment for the transition and to
give fillip to the business operations of the new entity (IDBI Ltd.), the then
IDBI’s Board decided that for effective transition to a banking company,
IDBI Ltd. should leverage on its banking subsidiary, IDBI Bank Ltd. The
scheme of Amalgamation/Merger of IDBI Bank Ltd. with IDBI Ltd became
effective from October 1, 2004 after the same was approved separately by
the respective General Body of Shareholders and by RBI, in terms of the
provisions of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.
The merger has brought in benefits in terms of enhanced size and
improved quality of balance sheet, lower cost of funds, extended branch
network, a higher technology platform, lean workforce, along with a wide
array of retail and wholesale products. This has benefited the various
stakeholders by increased value creation, along with the convenience of a
universal bank. The benefits of economies of scale and the convenience of
single-window servicing to clients is a major advantage. The opportunity
for the Bank has come from the access to cheaper short-term retail funds.
This has enabled the Bank to lower its overall cost of liability and price the
products competitively.
Enlarging the clientele base through market penetration, product
diversification or market development, market segmentation and pro-
193Notes
viding structured products under a single roof are the other advantages
for the Bank. Also, the enlarged capital base of the Bank has provided
impetus to expanding business. The in-house knowledge and expertise
in long term finance, including project finance, coupled with the skill of
retail financing, has enabled the merged entity to emerge as a preferred
source of finance from all segments of the market. IDBI Ltd. has, therefore,
become a banking company, having a wide array of wholesale and retail
products.
Merger of Erstwhile United Western Bank Ltd. (UWB)
The Government of India, by a notification dated September 30,
2006, conveyed its approval of the amalgamation of erstwhile UWB with
IDBI Ltd., with effect from October 3, 2006. Following the amalgamation
of erstwhile UWB into IDBI, the Bank’s delivery channels now comprise
508 branches, 880 ATMs spread across 320 centers. Further, the acquisition
of UWB has, inter alia, helped growing IDBI’s low-cost CASA deposit base
and priority sector business volumes.
Change of Name
To properly reflect the business of banking being carried on by
it, the name of ‘Industrial Development Bank of India Limited’ has been
changed to ‘IDBI Bank Limited’ w.e.f. May 07, 2008, the date on which
the Registrar of Companies, Maharashtra, issued fresh certificate of
incorporation. Subsequently, the change of name was notified by Reserve
Bank of India vide DBOD.BP.BC.NO.21.01.002/2007-08 dated May 16,
2008, which was published in Government Gazette dated on June 14, 2008.
Government Holding
As on February 27, 2009, the Central Government’s shareholding
in IDBI Ltd. is 52.68%. The provisions of Memorandum and Articles of
Association of IDBI Ltd. require that the “Central Government being a
shareholder of the Company, shall at all times maintain not less than 51%
of the issued capital of the Company. IDBI Ltd. has been categorized as
“Other Public Sector Bank” by the RBI. Further, the Central Government
has advised all its Ministries that the Bank “may be treated on par with
Nationalized Banks/State Bank of India by Government Departments/
194Notes
Public Sector Undertakings/ other entities for all purposes, including
deposits/bonds/ investments/ guarantees and government business”.
Profile of IDBI Bank Ltd.
IDBI Bank Ltd. is today one of India’s largest commercial Banks.
For over 40 years, IDBI Bank has essayed a key nation-building role,
first as the apex Development Financial Institution (DFI) (July 1, 1964
to September 30, 2004) in the realm of industry and thereafter as a full-
service commercial Bank (October 1, 2004 onwards). As a DFI, the
erstwhile IDBI stretched its canvas beyond mere project financing to
cover an array of services that contributed towards balanced geographical
spread of industries, development of identified backward areas, emergence
of a new spirit of enterprise and evolution of a deep and vibrant capital
market. On October 1, 2004, the erstwhile IDBI converted into a Banking
company (as Industrial Development Bank of India Limited) to undertake
the entire gamut of Banking activities while continuing to play its secular
DFI role. Post the mergers of the erstwhile IDBI Bank with its parent
company (IDBI Ltd.) on April 2, 2005 (appointed date: October 1, 2004)
and the subsequent merger of the erstwhile United Western Bank Ltd. with
IDBI Bank on October 3, 2006, the tech-savvy, new generation Bank with
majority Government shareholding today touches the lives of millions of
Indians through an array of corporate, retail, SME and Agri products and
services.
Headquartered in Mumbai, IDBI Bank today rides on the back of
a robust business strategy, a highly competent and dedicated workforce
and a state-of-the-art information technology platform, to structure and

Role of Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI)
History
Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI), set up on
April 2, 1990 under an Act of Indian Parliament, is the Principal Financial
Institution for the Promotion, Financing and Development of the Micro,
Small and Medium Enterprise (MSME) sector and for Co-ordination of
the functions of the institutions engaged in similar activities.
Provision of Charter
SIDBI was established on April 2, 1990. The Charter establishing
it, The Small Industries Development Bank of India Act, 1989 envisaged
SIDBI to be “the principal financial institution for the promotion,
financing and development of industry in the small scale sector and to
co-ordinate the functions of the institutions engaged in the promotion
and financing or developing industry in the small scale sector and for
matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.
Business Domain of SIDBI
The business domain of SIDBI consists of Micro, Small and
Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), which contribute significantly to the
national economy in terms of production, employment and exports.
MSME sector is an important pillar of Indian economy as it contributes
greatly to the growth of Indian economy with a vast network of around 3
crore units, creating employment of about 7 crore, manufacturing more
than 6,000 products, contributing about 45% to manufacturing output
and about 40% of exports, directly and indirectly. In addition, SIDBI’s
assistance also flows to the service sector including transport, health
care, tourism sectors etc.
Mandatory Objectives
Four basic objectives are set out in the SIDBI Charter. They are:
➢ ➢ 
Financing
➢ ➢ 
Promotion
196Notes
➢ ➢ 
Development
➢ ➢ 
Co-ordination
for orderly growth of industry in the small scale sector. The Charter
has provided SIDBI considerable flexibility in adopting appropriate
operational strategies to meet these objectives. The activities of SIDBI,
as they have evolved over the period of time, now meet almost all the
requirements of small scale industries which fall into a wide spectrum
constituting modern and technologically superior units at one end and
traditional units at the other
Development Outlook
The major issues confronting MSMEs are identified to be:
Technology obsolescence
➢ ➢ 
Managerial inadequacies
➢ ➢ 
Delayed Payments
➢ ➢ 
Poor Quality
➢ ➢ 
Incidence of Sickness
➢ ➢ 
Lack of Appropriate Infrastructure and
➢ ➢ 
Lack of Marketing Network
There can be many more similar issues hindering the orderly growth
of MSMEs. Over the years, SIDBI has put in place financing schemes either
through its direct financing mechanism or through indirect assistance
mechanism and special focus programmes under its P&D initiatives. In
its approach, SIDBI has struck a good balance between financing and
providing other support services.
Co-ordination and Understanding
As an apex institution, SIDBI makes use of the network of the
banks and state level financial institutions, which have retail outlets.
SIDBI supplements the efforts of existing institutions through its direct
assistance schemes to reach financial assistance to the ultimate borrowers
in the small scale sector. Refinancing, bills rediscounting, lines of credit
and resource support mechanisms have evolved over the period of time to
197Notes
route SIDBI’s assistance through the network of other retail institutions
in the financial system. Improved levels of co-ordination for development
of the small scale sector is also achieved through a system of dialogue
and obtaining feedback from the representatives of institutions of small
scale industries who are on the SIDBI’s National Advisory Committee and
Regional Advisory Committees.
SIDBI’s MOUs
SIDBI has entered into Memoranda of Understanding with
many banks, governmental agencies, international agencies, research
& development institutions and industry associations to facilitate a co-
ordinated approach in dealing with the issues for development of small
scale industries. SIDBI’s MOUs include the following:
➢ ➢ 
Banks - (18)
➢ ➢ 
Swiss Agency for Development and Co-operation
➢ ➢ 
Small Industries Development Organization
➢ ➢ 
Auto Components Manufactures Association
➢ ➢

➢ ➢ 
Asia and Pacific Centre for Transfer of Technology
➢ ➢ 
United Nations Industrial Development Organization
➢ ➢ 
Confederation of Indian Industry
➢ ➢ 
National Research Development Organization
➢ ➢ 
Government of India for channelizing TREAD assistance
➢ ➢ 
Small Enterprise Assistance Funds (SEAF) For setting up of SEAF
India SME Equity Fund and for other capacity building initiatives
for SMEs
Mission
“To facilitate and strengthen credit flow to MSMEs and address
both financial and developmental gaps in the MSME eco-system”
Vision
To emerge as a single window for meeting the financial and
developmental needs of the MSME sector to make it strong, vibrant
198Notes
and globally competitive, to position SIDBI Brand as the preferred and
customer - friendly institution and for enhancement of share - holder
wealth and highest corporate values through modern technology platform.
Shareholding
The entire issued capital of `450 crore has been divided into 45
crore shares of `10 each. Of the total `450 crore subscribed by IDBI, while
setting up of SIDBI, 19.21% has been retained by it and balance 80.79%
has been transferred / divested in favour of banks / institutions / insurance
companies owned and controlled by the Central Government.
Associates of SIDBI
a) Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises
(CGTMSE)
Credit to micro and small enterprises sector is generally perceived
as high risk lending, more so, when there is absence of any collateral. In
order to encourage banks to lend more to this sector, Government of India
and SIDBI have set up the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and
Small Enterprises (CGTMSE) in July 2000, to provide credit guarantee
support to collateral free / third-party guarantee free loans up to ` 100 lakh
extended by banks and lending institutions for micro and small enterprise

India SME Technology Services Ltd. India SME Technology Ser-
vices Limited (ISTSL), set up in November 2005, provides a platform for

ronment friendly technologies in the MSME sector. Efforts are being made
to facilitate reduction in Green House Gases in the MSME sector.
In order to strengthen and accelerate the process of technological
modernization in the MSME sector, ISTSL has entered into partnership
with various national and international organizations engaged in similar
activities. ISTSL took up the project for implementing Energy Efficient
technologies in Stainless Steel Re-rolling Cluster of Jodhpur, in association
199Notes
with KfW, Germany. The project is now being taken up for implementing
Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) project by implementing Energy
Efficiency measures, which are expected to generate CDM revenues,
besides reducing the cost of fuel being consumed by the units.
b) SME Rating Agency of India Ltd. (SMERA)
SIDBI, along with leading public, foreign and private sector banks
and Dun & Bradstreet Information Services India Private Limited (D&B),
set up SME Rating Agency of India Ltd. (SMERA) in September 2005, as
an MSME dedicated third-party rating agency to provide comprehensive,
transparent and reliable ratings and risk profiling.

NPAs for productive purposes which would facilitate greater and easier
flow of credit from the banking sector to the MSMEs. Set up in April 2008,
ISARC’s objective is to acquire NPAs and strive to maximize recovery
value through innovative resolution methods. It also complied with the
conditions stipulated by RBI while granting the Certificate of Registration
as an ARC and became fully operational from April 15, 2009.
Subsidiaries
a)
SIDBI Venture Capital Limited (SVCL)
SIDBI Venture Capital Ltd. (SVCL), a subsidiary of SIDBI set

Role of Industrial Reconstruction Bank of India (IRBI) or Industrial
Investment Bank of India (IIBI)
The Industrial Reconstruction Corporation of India Ltd. was set
up in 1971 as a primary agency for rehabilitation of sick industrial units.
It was renamed as the Industrial Reconstruction Bank of India (IRBI) by
an Act of Parliament with effect from March 20, 1985. IRBI functions as
the principal credit and reconstruction agency for industrial revival by
undertaking, modernization, expansion, reorganization, diversification or
rationalization of industry and also coordinates similar work of other in-
stitutions engaged therein and to assist and rehabilitate industrial cancers.
In March 1997, the Industrial Reconstruction Bank of India itself
was named as Industrial Investment Bank of India and converted into
a limited company to provide it operational flexibility to become self-
reliant. The Industrial Investment Bank has thus become a full-fledged
development financial institution. It will, however, continue its traditional
role of nursing ailing industrial units.
The IIBI is empowered
➢ ➢ 
to grant loans and advances to industrial concerns,
➢ ➢ 
to underwrite stocks, shares, bonds and debentures,
➢ ➢ 
to guarantee loans/deferred payments and performance obligations
of any contracts undertaken by industrial concerns, and
➢ ➢ 
to act as an agent of Central and State Governments, Reserve Bank,
State Bank, Scheduled Commercial and State Cooperative banks,
public financial institutions, SFCs, etc.
Its functions also include development activities such as providing
infrastructural facilities, raw materials, consultancy, managerial and
merchant banking services for reconstruction and development of
201Notes
industrial concerns and providing machinery and other equipment on
lease or hire-purchase basis.
The IIBI is empowered to take over management or possession or
both and can transfer by way of lease and sale the property of defaulting
industrial concerns. It can prepare schemes for reconstruction by scaling
down the liabilities to submit the schemes of merger or amalgamation for
approval of the Central Government. The Bank borrows funds from the
Government and also by way of issuing bonds and debentures.
Conclusion
The role of developmental financial institutions in India is
remarkable and the IFIC, erstwhile ICICI and erstwhile IDBI have
contributed a lot for the development of industries. Further, both ICICI
and IDBI have now emerged as universal banks and provide all the financial
services under one umbrella.

Role of State Industrial Development Corporations (SIDCs)
1)
Profile of Council of State Industries Development and Investment
Corporations of India (COSIDICI)
Established in 1976 as a Society under the Societies Registration
Act, 1860, the Council of State Industrial Development and Investment
Corporations of India (COSIDICI) is a national federation of state
level financial and investment corporations comprising State Financial
Corporations (SFCs), State Industrial Development Corporations
(SIDCs) and State Infrastructure Development Corporations engaged in
promotion, development and financing of industry in small, medium and
large sectors, besides developing industrial infrastructural facilities like
industrial estates, industrial parks, industrial townships, etc. As on 30th
September, 1999, COSIDICI has a membership of 56 state level institutions,
as indicated below:
➢ ➢ 
State Financial Corporation (SFCs) - 18: These corporations have
been set up at the state level under State Financial Corporations
Act, 1951. These corporations have been notified as “Public
Financial Institutions’ under Section 4-A of the Companies Act by
the Government of India
➢ ➢ 
State Industrial Development Corporations (SIDCs) - 28
➢ ➢ 
State Industrial Infrastructure Development and Investment
Corporations - 10. These corporations were set up under the
Companies Act, 1956 and have been functioning as ‘Public Limited
Companies’.
The main objective of this national federation is to act as a
clearing house for sharing of experiences by member corporation across
states, disseminating information of common interest among them and
to provide them with a common platform to the state level corporations
for ventilating their problems and grievances to the Government and all
India financial institutions and serve as a mouth-piece of this sector for
influencing the policies of the Government/financial institutions having
bearing on the development of this sector.
COSIDICI has been playing its role creditably during the past more
than two decades and has produced the desired impact on the growth of
219Notes
this sector. COSIDICI has established effective liaison with the concerned
departments of State Governments, Central Government and the all India
Financial Institutions, including RBI, IDBI, SIDBI, etc. Besides, COSIDICI
is an accredited member of CII, FICCI, SCOPE, Small Scale Industries
Board, Ministry of Industry, Govt. of India and actively participates in
their activities. COSIDICI has been successfully taking up various issues
affecting the business operations of these corporations, with the above
agencies and has been influencing the policies of the Government and
all India financial institutions to the advantage of this sector. Some of the
important objectives of COSIDICI are:
➢ ➢ 
To liaise with and to represent to the Central and State Governments,
term lending and other financial institutions on the common
problems and issues of member corporations
➢ ➢ 
To promote co-ordination, collaboration, joint participation and
general understanding among the member corporations etc.
➢ ➢ 
To render assistance to member corporations in their efforts to
improve efficiency of operations of their assisted and sponsored
units.
➢ ➢ 
To organize common service facilities, training courses, seminars,
meetings and study tours for the benefit of the member corporations.
➢ ➢ 
To sponsor studies, surveys, research and development projects
pertaining to industries.
➢ ➢ 
To establish and maintain at the Registered Office a commercial
and technical library and information Centre for use of member
corporations.
The COSIDICI has thus been co-coordinating and integrating the
activities of its member corporations and has been providing and arranging
means and facilities for dissemination of knowledge and information
relating to promotion and development of industries and for exchange
of views and ideas on subjects of common interests. For accomplishment
of these objectives and with a view to having a direct communication
link with the corporations, COSIDICI has been publishing a bi-monthly
journal titled ‘COSIDICI COURIER’ since 1978. The publication of this
journal aims at integrating the interests of our member corporations and
has proved to be a powerful vehicle for dissemination of information of
common interest among the members.
220Notes
COSIDICI has been arranging training programmes for the
senior executives of its member corporations to upgrade their conceptual
and operational skills. COSIDICI has been arranging special training
programmes exclusively for the benefit of state level corporations in
collaboration with the National Institute of Banking Studies and Corporate
Management A large number of senior executives from our member
corporations have benefited from these programmes.
The affairs of COSIDICI are managed by an Executive Committee
consisting of senior civil servants drawn from various state level
corporations. The composition of the Executive Committee is such that
all regions of the country are represented on it. As on date, the Executive
Committee has 18 members, who are elected by the General Body every
year.
2) State Industrial Development Corporations (SIDCs)
The State Industrial Development Corporations were set up under
the Companies Act, 1956, as wholly owned state government undertakings
for promotion and development of medium and large industries. In
addition to provision of financial assistance, they are also involved in
developing industrial infrastructure like industrial estates, industrial
parks and setting up industrial projects either on their own or in the joint
sector in collaboration with private entrepreneurs or as wholly owned
subsidiaries. SIDCs exist in all the States and have developed industrial
infrastructure facilities to enable prospective entrepreneurs to set up their
industries in the states.
These corporations render technical assistance to the entrepreneurs
in the formulation of the project reports and also provide common facilities
in the industrial estates. These corporations provide loans and advances
to the industrial units in the medium and large sectors to the maximum
of `400 lakhs. The interest rate ranges between 13.5% to 17% depending
upon the size of the loan.
Facilities and Incentives Available for Setting up Industries in the States
In each state a State Financial Corporation and a State Industrial
Development Corporation have been functioning for more than four
221Notes
decades. Operating at the grass root level, these development finance
institutions have played a significant role in developing industries in the
states with particular emphasis on development of backward regions.
These corporations have played a crucial role in the promotion of first
generation entrepreneurs. They have recorded an impressive performance
in providing financial assistance for promotion and development of small
scale, medium scale and large scale industries in their respective states.
As on 31st March, 1999, their cumulative sanctions and disbursements
aggregated ` 44,704.6 crores and `34,988.6 crores forming 10.5% and 12%
of the total sanctions and disbursements made by all financial institutions
in the country respectively.
Role of Unit Trust of India
The Mutual Fund industry in India started in 1963 with the
formation of Unit Trust of India, at the initiative of the Government of
India and Reserve Bank.
First Phase - 1964-87
Unit Trust of India (UTI) was established in 1963 by the Act of
Parliament. It was set up by and functioned under the Regulatory and
administrative control of the Reserve Bank of India. In 1978, UTI was de-
linked from the RBI and the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI)
took over the regulatory and administrative control. The first scheme
launched by UTI was Unit Scheme 1964. At the end of 1980, UTI had
`6,700 Crore of assets under management.

Second Phase - 1987-1993 (Entry of Public Sector Funds)
1987 marked the entry of non-UTI, Mutual Funds set up by public
sector banks, Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) and General
222Notes
Insurance Corporation of India (GIC). SBI Mutual Fund was the first
non-UTI Mutual Fund established in June 1987 followed by Canbank
Mutual Fund (Dec ‘87), Punjab National Bank Mutual Fund (Aug ‘89),
Indian Bank Mutual Fund (Nov ‘89), Bank of India (Jun ‘90), Bank of
Baroda Mutual Fund (Oct ‘92). LIC established its Mutual Fund in June
1989 while GIC had set up its Mutual Fund in December 1990. At the end
of 1993, the Mutual Fund industry had assets under management worth
` 47,004 Crore.

had set up its Mutual Fund in December 1990.
At the end of 1993, the Mutual Fund industry had assets under
management worth ` 47,004 Crore.
Third Phase - 1993-2003 (Entry of Private Sector Funds)
With the entry of private sector funds in 1993, a new era started
in the Indian Mutual Fund industry, giving the Indian investors a wider
choice of fund families. Also, 1993 was the year in which the first Mutual
Fund Regulations came into being, under which all Mutual Funds, except
UTI were to be registered and governed. The erstwhile Kothari Pioneer
(now merged with Franklin Templeton) was the first private sector Mutual
Fund registered in July 1993.
The 1993 SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations were substituted by a
more comprehensive and revised Mutual Fund Regulations in 1996. The
industry now functions under the SEBI (Mutual Fund) Regulations 1996.
The number of Mutual Fund houses went on increasing, with many
foreign Mutual Funds setting up funds in India. Also, the industry has
witnessed several mergers and acquisitions then. As of January 2003, there
were 33 Mutual Funds with total assets worth ` 1,21,805 Crore. The Unit
Trust of India with `44,541 Crore of assets under management was way
ahead of other Mutual Funds.

Fourth Phase - since February 2003
In February 2003, following the repeal of the Unit Trust of India Act,
1963 UTI was bifurcated into two separate entities. One is the Specified
Undertaking of the Unit Trust of India with assets under management
worth `29,835 Crore as of January 2003, representing broadly, the assets
of US 64 scheme, assured return and certain other schemes. The Specified
Undertaking of Unit Trust of India is functioning under an administrator
and under the rules framed by Government of India and does not come
under the purview of the Mutual Fund Regulations.
The second one is UTI Mutual Fund Ltd, sponsored by SBI, PNB,
BOB and LIC. It is registered with SEBI and functions under the Mutual
Fund Regulations. There were several reasons responsible for the current
phase of consolidation and growth of the Mutual Fund industry:
➢ ➢ 
Bifurcation of the erstwhile UTI, which in March 2000 had more
than `76,000 Crore of assets under management
➢ ➢ 
Setting up of a UTI Mutual Fund, conforming to the SEBI Mutual
Fund Regulations
➢ ➢ 
Recent mergers taking place among different private sector funds

balanced and well-diversified portfolio for all the funds and a rigorous
in-house research based approach to all its investments. It is committed
to adopt and maintain good fund management practices and a process
based investment management. UTI Mutual Fund follows an investment
approach of giving as equal an importance to asset allocation and sectoral
allocation, as is given to security selection while managing any fund. It
combines top-down and bottom-up approaches to enable the portfolios/
funds to adapt to different market conditions so as to prevent missing an
investment opportunity. In terms of its funds performance, UTI Mutual
fund aims to remain consistently in the top quartile vis-à-vis the funds in
the peer group.
Life Insurance Corporation (LIC)
On the 19th of January, 1956, life insurance industry in India
was nationalized. About 154 Indian insurance companies, 16 non-
Indian companies and 75 provident were operating in India at the time
of nationalization. Nationalization was accomplished in two stages;
initially the management of the companies was taken over by means of an
Ordinance, and later, the ownership too by means of a comprehensive bill.
The Parliament of India passed the Life Insurance Corporation Act on the
19th of June 1956, and the Life Insurance Corporation of India was created
on 1st September, 1956, with the objective of spreading life insurance
much more widely and in particular to the rural areas with a view to reach
all insurable persons in the country, providing them adequate financial
cover at a reasonable cost.
226Notes
LIC had 5 zonal offices, 33 divisional offices and 212 branch
offices, apart from its corporate office in the year 1956. Since life insurance
contracts are long term contracts and during the currency of the policy it
requires a variety of services need was felt in the later years to expand
the operations and place a branch office at each district headquarter. Re-
organization of LIC took place and large numbers of new branch offices
were opened. As a result of re-organization servicing functions were
transferred to the branches, and branches were made accounting units. It
worked wonders with the performance of the corporation. It may be seen
that from about 200.00 crores of New Business in 1957 the corporation
crossed 1000.00 crores only in the year 1969-70, and it took another 10
years for LIC to cross 2000.00 crore mark of new business. But with re-
organization happening in the early eighties, by 1985-86 LIC had already
crossed 7000.00 crore Sum Assured on new policies.
Today LIC functions with 2048 fully computerized branch
offices, 109 divisional offices, 8 zonal offices, 992 satellite offices and the
Corporate office. LIC’s Wide Area Network covers 109 divisional offices
and connects all the branches through a Metro Area Network. LIC has
tied up with some Banks and Service providers to offer on-line premium
collection facility in selected cities. LIC’s ECS and ATM premium payment
facility is an addition to customer convenience. Apart from on-line Kiosks
and IVRS, Info Centres have been commissioned at Mumbai, Ahmedabad,
Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkata, New Delhi, Pune and many
other cities. With a vision of providing easy access to its policyholders,
LIC has launched its SATELLITE SAMPARK offices. The satellite offices
are smaller, leaner and closer to the customer. The digitalized records
of the satellite offices will facilitate anywhere servicing and many other
conveniences in the future.
LIC continues to be the dominant life insurer even in the liberalized
scenario of Indian insurance and is moving fast on a new growth trajectory
surpassing its own past records. LIC has issued over one crore policies
during the current year. It has crossed the milestone of issuing 1,01,32,955
new policies by 15th Oct, 2005, posting a healthy growth rate of 16.67%
over the corresponding period of the previous year. From then to now,
LIC has crossed many milestones and has set unprecedented performance
records in various aspects of life insurance business. The same motives
which inspired our forefathers to bring insurance into existence in this
227Notes
country inspire us at LIC to take this message of protection to light the
lamps of security in as many homes as possible and to help the people in
providing security to their families.
Mission
“Explore and enhance the quality of life of people through
financial security by providing products and services of aspired attributes
with competitive returns, and by rendering resources for economic
development.”
Vision
“A
trans-nationally
competitive
financial
conglomerate
of
significance to societies and Pride of India.”
Objectives of LIC
a) Spread Life Insurance widely and in particular to the rural areas
and to the socially and economically backward classes with a view
to reaching all insurable persons in the country and providing them
adequate financial cover against death at a reasonable cost.
b) Maximize mobilization of people’s savings by making insurance-
linked savings adequately attractive.
c) Bear in mind, in the investment of funds, the primary obligation
to its policyholders, whose money it holds in trust, without losing
sight of the interest of the community as a whole; the funds to
be deployed to the best advantage of the investors as well as the
community as a whole, keeping in view national priorities and
obligations of attractive return.
d) Conduct business with utmost economy and with the full realization
that the moneys belong to the policyholders.
e) Act as trustees of the insured public in their individual and collective
capacities.
f) Meet the various life insurance needs of the community that would
arise in the changing social and economic environment.
228Notes
g) Involve all people working in the Corporation to the best of their
capability in furthering the interests of the insured public by
providing efficient service with courtesy.
h) Promote amongst all agents and employees of the Corporation a
sense of participation, pride and job satisfaction through discharge
of their duties with dedication towards achievement of Corporate
Objective.
General Insurance Corporation Reinsurer (GIC Re)
The entire general insurance business in India was nationalised
by General Insurance Business (Nationalisation) Act, 1972 (GIBNA). The
Government of India (GOI), through Nationalisation took over the shares
of 55 Indian insurance companies and the undertakings of 52 insurers
carrying on general insurance business. General Insurance Corporation
of India (GIC) was formed in pursuance of Section 9(1) of GIBNA. It was
incorporated on 22 November 1972 under the Companies Act, 1956 as
a private company limited by shares. GIC was formed for the purpose
of superintending, controlling and carrying on the business of general
insurance.
As soon as GIC was formed, GOI transferred all the shares it held of
the general insurance companies to GIC. Simultaneously, the nationalised
undertakings were transferred to Indian insurance companies. After a
process of mergers among Indian insurance companies, four companies
were left as fully owned subsidiary companies of GIC
(1) National Insurance Company Limited,
(2) The New India Assurance Company Limited,
(3) The Oriental Insurance Company Limited,
(4) United India Insurance Company Limited.
The next landmark happened on 19th April 2000, when the
Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority Act, 1999 (IRDAA)
came into force. This act also introduced amendment to GIBNA and the
Insurance Act, 1938. An amendment to GIBNA removed the exclusive
privilege of GIC and its subsidiaries carrying on general insurance in India.
229Notes
In November 2000, GIC is renotified as the Indian Reinsurer and
through administrative instruction, its supervisory role over subsidiaries
was ended. With the General Insurance Business (Nationalisation)
Amendment Act 2002 (40 of 2002) coming into force from March 21, 2003
GIC ceased to be a holding company of its subsidiaries. Their ownership
was vested with Government of India.
Conclusion
The state level financial institutions such as State Finance
Corporations and State Industries Development Corporations operate in
each of the States in India. They get financial assistance from the All India
Financial Institutions. Further, the investment institutions such as UTI,
LIC and GIC have transformed the investment market in India.

assistance to entrepreneurs by way of direct equity participation.
Based on IFCI Venture’s credentials and strengths, Unit Trust of
India (UTI), entrusted RCTC with the management of a new venture
capital fund named Venture Capital Unit Scheme (VECAUS-III) in 1991.
The size of VECAUS-III was `80 Crores, contributed by UTI and IFCI.
To reflect the shift in the company’s activities, the name of RCTC was
changed to IFCI Venture Capital Funds Ltd. (IFCI Venture) in February
2000. In order to focus on Asset Management Activities, IFCI Venture
discontinued Risk Capital and Technology Finance Scheme(s) in 2000-
01 and continued managing VECAUS-III. In 2007, as UTI had ceased to
carry out its activities and its assets vested with Specified Undertaking
of the Unit Trust of India (SUUTI), the portfolio of VECAUS-III under
management of IFCI Venture was transferred to SUUTI.

Over the years, IFCI Venture acquired expertise and experience of
investing in technology-oriented & innovative projects. It has pioneered
efforts for widening entrepreneurial base in the country and catalyzed the
introduction of Venture Capital activity in India. It also provides advisory

Housing and Urban Development Corporation of India (HUDCO)
Genesis
The housing and urban development sector plays a significant role
in the economic and social development of a country. The access to and the
quality of housing and urban basic services directly influence the quality
of life of people, their productivity levels and growth potential. Before
the establishment of HUDCO, the Government of India was operating a
number of subsidized housing schemes and loan schemes. The subsidized
housing schemes were meant for industrial workers, economically weaker
section of the society and slum dwellers, while the loan schemes were
238Notes
targeted for the people in the low-income and middle-income groups
as well as rental housing schemes for State Government employees. All
these schemes were under the direct control of the Ministry of Works and
Housing. Such a system of housing finance did not give the required thrust
for promoting housing development activities, which in many cases were
considered of lower priority.
Towards the close of the 1960s, it was realized the need of a setting
up a housing organization in the country as the availability and cost of
bank credit were the prime constraints in this development. Since the
banking industry, until then, was in the hands of a few industrial houses,
the first major step taken to initiate change in favour of the poor was the
nationalization of the banks in June 1969. However, when the then Hon’ble
Prime Minister Smt Indira Gandhi looked for ways to improve the living
conditions of slum-dwellers and economically less fortunate peoples, she
found that while we had a host of All India Term Lending Institution such
as IDBI, IFCI, ICICI etc; catering to the diverse credit and related needs of
the Indian industry, there was no institution to provide housing finance to
the rural and urban poor or the even to meet the credit needs of housing
boards, development authorities and other urban bodies which were being
setup by the State Government during the fourth Plan period.
It was in this context that a decision was taken at the highest level
to set a Housing and Urban Development Corporation (HUDCO) which
could take a comprehensive look at the need of the sector and find workable
and effective solutions. This experiment of establishing a unique techno-
financial institution and the fascinating journey it undertook during the
last four decades would certainly qualify as one of the key developments
in this sector in the whole world. The establishment of HUDCO in 1970
as a sectoral institution for comprehensively dealing with the problems of
growing housing shortages, rising number of slums and for fulfilling the
pressing needs of the economically weaker section of the society was one
of the significant steps in the series of initiatives taken by Government.
Thus the setting up of HUDCO was aimed at accelerating the pace of con-
struction and elimination of housing shortages and for orderly develop-
ment of urban centres. The Housing and Urban Development Corporation
Ltd. (HUDCO) was incorporated on April 25, 1970 under the Companies
Act 1956, as a fully owned enterprise of the Government of India.
239Notes

National Housing Bank (NHB)
Genesis
The Sub-Group on Housing Finance for the Seventh Five Year Plan
(1985-90) identified the non-availability of long-term finance to individual
households on any significant scale as a major lacuna impeding progress
of the housing sector and recommended the setting up of a national level
institution. The Committee of Secretaries considered’ the recommendation
and set up the High Level Group under the Chairmanship of Dr. C.
Rangarajan, the then Deputy Governor, RBI to examine the proposal and
recommended the setting up of National Housing Bank as an autonomous
housing finance institution.
The recommendations of the High Level Group were accepted by
the Government of India. The Hon’ble Prime Minister of India, while
presenting the Union Budget for 1987-88 on February 28, 1987 announced
the decision to establish the National Housing Bank (NHB) as an apex level
institution for housing finance. Following that, the National Housing Bank
Bill (91 of 1987) providing the legislative framework for the establishment
of NHB was passed by Parliament in the winter session of 1987 and with
the assent of the Hon’ble President of India on December 23, 1987, became
an Act of Parliament.
243Notes
The National Housing Policy, 1988 envisaged the setting up of
NHB as the Apex level institution for housing. In pursuance of the above,
NHB was set up on July 9, 1988 under the National Housing Bank Act,
1987. NHB is wholly owned by Reserve Bank of India, which contributed
the entire paid-up capital. The general superintendence, direction and
management of the affairs and business of NHB vest, under the Act, in a
Board of Directors. The Head Office of NHB is at New Delhi.
Objectives
NHB has been established to achieve, inter alia, the following
objectives –
➢ ➢ 
To promote a sound, healthy, viable and cost effective housing
finance system to cater to all segments of the population and to
integrate the housing finance system with the overall financial
system.
➢ ➢ 
To promote a network of dedicated housing finance institutions to
adequately serve various regions and different income groups.
➢ ➢ 
To augment resources for the sector and channelize them for
housing.
➢ ➢ 
To make housing credit more affordable.
➢ ➢ 
To regulate the activities of housing finance companies based on
regulatory and supervisory authority derived under the Act.
➢ ➢ 
To encourage augmentation of supply of buildable land and also
building materials for housing and to upgrade the housing stock in
the country.
➢ ➢ 
To encourage public agencies to emerge as facilitators and suppliers
of serviced land, for housing.
Organization
NHB is a lean, officer oriented, professionally managed institution
with its headquarters in Delhi and offices in Mumbai, Hyderabad,
Bangalore, Chennai, Kolkata, Lucknow and Ahmedabad. It has 84
professionals at different levels. NHB is committed to pursuit of excellence
through innovation, doer work culture and contemporary work practices
with technology intervention.
244Notes
Functions of NHB
a) Regulation
In terms of the National Housing Bank Act, 1987, National Housing
Bank is expected, in the public interest, to regulate the housing finance
system of the country to its advantage or to prevent the affairs of any
housing finance institution being conducted in a manner detrimental to
the interest of the depositors or in a manner prejudicial to the interest of
the housing finance institutions. For this, National Housing Bank has been
empowered to determine the policy and give directions to the housing
finance institutions and their auditors.
Besides the regulatory provisions of the National Housing Bank Act,
1987, National Housing Bank has issued the Housing Finance Companies
(NHB) Directions, 2001 as also Guidelines for Asset Liability Management
System in Housing Finance Companies. These are periodically updated
through issue of circulars and notifications. As part of the supervisory
process, an entry level regulation is sought to be achieved through a system
of registration of housing finance companies. National Housing Bank
supervises the sector through a system of on-site and off-site surveillance.
b) Financing
NHB supports housing finance sector by
i)
Refinance Operations: HDFC extends refinance to different
primary lenders in respect of eligible housing loans extended by
them to individual beneficiaries, for project loans extended by them
to various implementing agencies. A number of Primary Lending
Institutions (PLIs) are currently active in the housing finance sector
in India. The institutions provide finance to individual borrowers,
builders, corporate houses etc. for purchase/construction of
houses and for repair / up gradation of existing house. With the
objective of providing long-term funds to these institutions, NHB
extends refinance in respect of the loans extended by them. The
following categories of institutions are eligible to take refinance
from NHB:; Scheduled Commercial Banks; Scheduled Urban
Cooperative Banks; Regional Rural Banks; State Level Apex Co-
245Notes
operative Housing Finance Companies; Agriculture and Rural
Development Banks and New Schemes.
ii)
Project Finance: HDFC lends directly in respect of projects un­
dertaken by public housing agencies for housing construction and
development of housing related infrastructure. The eligible agencies
for project lending are public agencies, micro financial institutions/
Self Help Groups/NGOs/ registered Societies and joint ventures and
Public Private Partnerships. The Bank offers financial assistance for
various types of projects right from township development, land
acquisition and development, slum redevelopment projects etc. The
same are enumerated below under three main heads namely special
projects, general projects and short term facility:
➢ ➢ 
Special Projects which include Slum redevelopment projects
and Housing for EWS/LIG etc.
➢ ➢ 
General Projects which include Township cum housing
development projects; Construction of houses on individual
plots or group housing; and Land acquisition for the purpose
of township and housing development; Land development
for housing including provision of facilities like roads, water
supply, storm water drains, sewerage system etc.; Development
of land into buildable plots; Employee Housing; Special
housing projects for people affected by natural calamities;
and Water & Sanitation.
➢ ➢ 
Short Term Facility which includes short term finance facility
up to a maximum period of 2 years to public agencies engaged
in housing projects.
➢ ➢ 
Takeover of Term Loan Liabilities of Public Housing and
development Agencies
The option of availing fixed or floating interest rates is available. The
interest rates are determined based on the Prime Lending Rate of the Bank.
NHB reviews and resets the interest rates from time to time, depending
upon the market conditions, commercial interest etc. Prepayment of
loans is permissible with payment of prepayment levy. The extent of
financing is based on the type of project and also the rating assigned by
National Housing Bank. It varies between 65 to 100% of the project cost.
The maximum period of loan is 15 years. Depending on the Agency/
246Notes
project, the project finance shall be secured through one or more of the
following such as Mortgage/charge over immovable property acceptable to
NHB, Charge over receivables, Bank Guarantee, Government Guarantee,
Corporate Guarantee, Charge on Book Debts, Fixed Deposit Receipts,
Hypothecation of property, Any other security acceptable to NHB, and
interim Security (in some cases interim security may be required till the
main security is lodged with the Bank). NHB provides excellent customer
service by quick disposal of project proposals and individual attention. It
will also provide requisite financial and technical expertise and guidance
in project formulation, if so required by the borrowers.
iii) Guarantee: HDFC guarantee the repayment of principal and
payment of interest on bonds issued by Housing Finance
Companies. Housing Finance companies depend to a great extent
on refinance assistance from NHB. However, the extension of
refinance assistance by NHB is constrained by various factors like
NHB’s own Net Owned Funds (NOF), HFCs’ borrowing power
etc. In addition, in the present liberalized environment, the HFCs
prefer to raise resources directly from market in order to eliminate
the cost of intermediation. Besides NHB refinance, HFCs mainly
depend upon term loans from banks and public deposits. The
guarantee scheme envisages provision of guarantee by NHB to the
investors regarding repayment of principal and interest during the
top end (say last two years) irrespective of the repayment schedule
fixed by the HFC and the guarantee shall not exceed 67% of the
total amount to be raised and the interest thereof. The HFCs
desirous of availing the guarantee will have to create a floating
charge on the assets equivalent to 125% of the principal amount
in favour of NHB. For extending the guarantee, the HFCs shall
be charged 75 basis points per year of the amount to be floated as
guarantee commission and this shall be payable upfront. The HFC
shall create appropriate bond/debenture redemption reserves as
may be laid down under the Companies Act from time to time.
The HFC shall furnish such returns/information as may be laid
down from time to time for the purpose of availing refinance. The
HFC desirous of availing the guarantee from NHB shall comply
with the following terms and conditions:
247Notes
➢ ➢ 
The bond issue shall carry at least a rating of “AA-” from an
approved rating agency.
➢ ➢ 
The maturity of the bonds/debentures shall be for a period of
five years to begin with.
➢ ➢ 
The market shall determine the coupon rate.
iv) Securitization: Acting as Special Purpose Vehicle for securitizing
the housing loan receivables. NHB has been playing a lead role in
starting up Mortgage Backed Securitization and development of a
secondary mortgage market in the country. NHB launched the pilot
issues of Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS) in August 2000 in the
Indian financial market, followed by other MBS issues cumulating
to `664 crores. Support to Mortgage Backed Securitization has
been a major policy initiative of the Government as manifested
in its National Housing and Habitat Policy announced in 1998.
The policy has enjoined upon National Housing Bank (NHB) to
play a lead role in starting mortgage backed securitization and
development of a secondary mortgage market in the country. A
major milestone in creating a framework for such transactions has
been the amendment of the National Housing Bank Act, 1987 by the
Government of India. The National Housing Bank (Amendment)
Act, 2000 has come into force from June 12, 2000, which, inter
alia, provides for creating Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) Trust
by NHB for taking up such transactions and issuing MBS in
various forms.
Export and Import Bank of India (EXIM BANK)
Export-Import Bank of India is the premier export finance
institution of the country, set up in 1982 under the Export-Import Bank
of India Act 1981. Government of India launched the institution with
a mandate, not just to enhance exports from India, but to integrate
the country’s foreign trade and investment with the overall economic
growth. Since its inception, Exim Bank of India has been both a catalyst
and a key player in the promotion of cross border trade and investment.
Commencing operations as a purveyor of export credit, like other Export
Credit Agencies in the world, Exim Bank of India has, over the period,
evolved into an institution that plays a major role in partnering Indian
248Notes
industries, particularly the Small and Medium Enterprises, in their
globalization efforts, through a wide range of products and services offered
at all stages of the business cycle, starting from import of technology and
export product development to export production, export marketing, pre-
shipment and post-shipment and overseas investment.
The Initiatives
Exim Bank of India has been the prime mover in encouraging
project exports from India. The Bank provides Indian project exporters
with a comprehensive range of services to enhance the prospect of their
securing export contracts, particularly those funded by Multilateral
Funding Agencies like the World Bank, Asian Development Bank,
African Development Bank and European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development. The Bank extends lines of credit to overseas financial
institutions, foreign governments and their agencies, enabling them to
finance imports of goods and services from India on deferred credit terms.
Exim Bank’s lines of Credit obviate credit risks for Indian exporters and are
of particular relevance to SME exporters. The Bank’s Overseas Investment
Finance programme offers a variety of facilities for Indian investments
and acquisitions overseas. The facilities include loan to Indian companies
for equity participation in overseas ventures, direct equity participation
by Exim Bank in the overseas venture and non-funded facilities such
as letters of credit and guarantees to facilitate local borrowings by the
overseas venture. The Bank provides financial assistance by way of term
loans in Indian rupees/foreign currencies for setting up new production
facility, expansion/modernization/up gradation of existing facilities
and for acquisition of production equipment/technology. Such facilities

SME & AGRI Finance
India has a vibrant SME sector that plays an important role in
sustaining economic growth, increasing trade, generating employment
and creating new entrepreneurship in India. Indian SMEs require business
advisory services to enhance their international competitiveness in a
highly competitive globalizing world. The SMEs find the services of
reputed national and international consultants as not cost effective and
often, not adequately focused.
Recognizing this knowledge gap, Exim Bank of India has been
endeavoring to provide a suite of services to its SME clients. These include
providing business leads, handholding during the process of winning an
export contract and thus assisting the generation of export business on
success fee basis, countries/ sector information dissemination, capacity
building in niche areas such as quality, safety, export marketing, etc. and
financial advisory services such as loan syndication, etc.

Rural Initiatives
With the advent of globalization, the barriers to trade are getting
dismantled and the dividing line between national and global markets is
slowly disappearing. While this phenomenon has resulted in expansion of
market opportunities for products and services, it has also made certain
sections in developing countries more vulnerable to market vagaries. Thus,
the objectives of Exim Bank’s rural initiatives are twofold, viz., a) Poverty
reduction through export linkages and b) Benefit of Globalization to grass
root rural enterprises.
EXIM Bank’s Export Marketing Service
In order to assist SMEs and rural enterprises, EXIM Bank has
put in place an Export Marketing Service (EMS) programme. Under
EMS, EXIM Bank undertakes export marketing of good quality products
through its own overseas offices, its network partners abroad on ‘success
fee’ basis. The Bank does not charge any upfront fees, but collect 2-3% of
the sales value as service fee only if it is successful in securing orders for
the products. The Bank has been successful in securing lucrative orders
for rural enterprises from USA, UK, Singapore, Dubai and Johannesburg,
where the Bank has its own offices.
The products supported include embroidered clothing, bamboo
pens, incense sticks, pomegranate fruit juice concentrate, sandstone
blocks, matches, etc. During the course of its interactions with overseas
257Notes
buyers, the Bank could collect lot of information on quality, packaging,
design requirements and guide the Indian suppliers accordingly and
thereby enhance the market acceptance of the products.
Exim Bank has been organizing specialized export marketing
training programmes to SMEs and rural enterprises with faculty
drawn from industry and management institutions at the Bank’s
training centres located in various cities in India. Faculty support is
also accessed from international trade promotion agencies like CBI
(Netherlands), JETRO (Japan) for specialized inputs on market entry

Lesson 3.4 - International Financial Institutions
Learning Objectives
➢ ➢ 
To understand the role of International Bank for Reconstruction
and Development (IBRD).
➢ ➢ 
To understand the role of International Finance Corporation (IFC).
➢ ➢ 
To understand the role of International Development Association
(IDA).
Introduction
In this lesson, let us understand the role of international financial
institutions such as IBRD, IFC and IDA.
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)
Background
Founded in 1944 to help Europe recover from World War II, the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) is one
of five institutions that make up the World Bank Group. IBRD is the
part of the World Bank (IBRD/IDA) that works with middle-income and
creditworthy poorer countries to promote sustainable, equitable and job-
creating growth, reduce poverty and address issues of regional and global
importance.
Structured something like a cooperative, IBRD is owned and
operated for the benefit of its 188 member countries. Delivering flexible,
timely and tailored financial products, knowledge and technical services,
and strategic advice helps its members achieve results. Through the World
Bank Treasury, IBRD clients also have access to capital on favorable terms
in larger volumes, with longer maturities, and in a more sustainable
manner than world financial markets typically provide.
264Notes
Specifically, the IBRD
➢ ➢ 
supports long-term human and social development needs that
private creditors do not finance;
➢ ➢ 
preserves borrowers’ financial strength by providing support
in crisis periods, which is when poor people are most adversely
affected;
➢ ➢ 
uses the leverage of financing to promote key policy and institutional
reforms (such as safety net or anticorruption reforms);
➢ ➢ 
creates a favorable investment climate in order to catalyze the
provision of private capital;
➢ ➢ 
provides financial support (in the form of grants made available
from the IBRD’s net income) in areas that are critical to the well-
being of poor people in all countries.
Middle-income countries, where 70 percent of the world’s poor
live, have made profound improvements in economic management and
governance over the past two decades and are rapidly increasing their
demand for the strategic, intellectual and financial resources the World
Bank has to offer. The challenge facing the IBRD is to better manage and
deliver its resources to best meet the needs of these countries. To increase
its impact in middle-income countries, IBRD is working closely with the
International Finance Corporation (IFC), the Multilateral Investment
Guarantee Agency (MIGA), the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
and other multilateral development banks. In the course of its work,
IBRD is also striving to capitalize on middle-income countries’ own
accumulated knowledge and development experiences and collaborates
with foundations, civil society partners and donors in the development
community.
IBRD Products and Services
IBRD aims to reduce poverty in middle-income and creditworthy
poorer countries by promoting sustainable development through loans,
guarantees, risk management products, and (non-lending) analytical and
advisory services.
265Notes
IBRD has three main business lines:
➢ ➢ 
Strategy and Coordination Services
➢ ➢ 
Financial Services
➢ ➢ 
Knowledge Services
• Poverty Assessments
• Social and Structural Reviews
• Public Expenditure Reviews
• Sector Reports
• Country Economic Memoranda
• Knowledge Sharing
How IBRD is Financed
IBRD raises most of its funds on the world’s financial markets. It
has become one of the most established borrowers since issuing its first
bond in 1947 to finance the reconstruction of Europe after World War
Two. Investors see IBRD bonds as a safe and profitable place to put their
money and their cash finances projects in middle-income countries. The
income that IBRD has generated over the years has allowed it to fund
development activities and to ensure its financial strength, which enables
it to borrow at low cost and offer clients’ good borrowing terms.
IBRD became a major player on the international capital markets by
developing modern debt products, opening new markets for debt issuance,
and by building up a broad investor base around the world of pension
funds, insurance companies, central banks, and individuals. The World
Bank’s borrowing requirements are primarily determined by its lending
activities for development projects. As World Bank lending has changed
over time, so has its annual borrowing program. In 1998 for example,
IBRD borrowing peaked at $28 billion with the Asian financial crisis. It is
now projected to borrow between $10 to 15 billion a year. IBRD borrows
at attractive rates on the capital markets thanks to its triple-A status that
it has had with credit rating agencies since 1959. This has enabled it to
borrow in U.S. dollars, for example, at an overall funding cost that comes
close to that of the U.S. Treasury.
266Notes
IBRD enjoys its high credit rating because it is backed by the
capital commitments of its 186 shareholder governments. It is also the
result of IBRD’s strong balance sheet, prudent financial policies, and its
expected treatment as a preferred creditor when a country has difficulty
in repaying its loans. IBRD has also profited from anticipating shifts in
investor preferences and investing in the risk management and systems
to take advantage of those trends. IBRD has to its credit a string of firsts
in its borrowing program. These include the first currency swap in
international markets in 1981, through to the introduction of the first
global bond in 1989, to the first fully integrated electronic bond offering
via the Internet in 2000. In 2003, the World Bank executed the first fully
electronic swap auction.
Innovations by IBRD have also supported its goal of promoting
development. Although much of its borrowing is in U.S. dollars, IBRD has
over the years offered bonds in more than 40 different currencies. Its issues
in nascent capital markets have often been a catalyst for improving market
infrastructure and efficiency. IBRD’s earns an income every year from the
return on its equity and from the small margin it makes on lending. This
pays for IBRD’s operating expenses, goes into reserves to strengthen the
balance sheet and also provides an annual transfer to the International
Development Association (IDA). IBRD has raised the bulk of the money
loaned by the World Bank to alleviate poverty around the world. This
has been done at a relatively low cost to taxpayers, with governments
paying in $11 billion in capital since 1946 to generate more than
$400 billion in loans.
International Finance Corporation (IFC)
A daring new idea when created in the 1950s, IFC is the largest
organization of its kind in the world. A sense of innovation and the strength
of our core corporate values--excellence, commitment, integrity and
teamwork--have driven this remarkable growth over the years. Holding
a $48.8 billion portfolio touching almost every major industry, we now
reach millions of people in more than 100 countries, creating jobs, raising
living standards, and building a better future.
➢ ➢ 
Vision is that people should have the opportunity to escape poverty
and improve their lives.
267Notes
➢ ➢ 
Values are excellence, commitment, integrity, teamwork, and
diversity.
➢ ➢ 
Purpose is to create opportunity for people to escape poverty and
improve their lives by:
• Mobilizing other sources of finance for private enterprise
development
• Promoting open and competitive markets in developing
countries
• Supporting companies and other private sector partners where
there is a gap
• Helping generate productive jobs and deliver essential services
to the poor and the vulnerable
To achieve the said purpose, IFC offers development-impact
solutions through firm-level interventions (direct investments, advisory
services, and the IFC Asset Management Company); by promoting global
collective action; by strengthening governance and standard-setting; and
through business-enabling-environment work.
Organization
IFC coordinates its activities with the other institutions of the
World Bank Group but is legally and financially independent.
Ownership & Governance
IFC's 184 member countries, through a Board of Governors and
a Board of Directors, guide IFC’s programs and activities. Each country
appoints one governor and one alternate.
Management
The World Bank Group’s president also serves as IFC’s president.
The Management Team assists the Executive Vice President and CEO in
decision-making and strategic planning. IFC’s projects and programs are
evaluated by the Independent Evaluation Group. Accountability is ensured
by the independent Office of the Compliance Advisor/Ombudsman.
IFC’s operations are carried out by its departments, most of which are
268Notes
organized by world region or global industry/sector. IFC has over 3,400
staff, of which 51% work in field offices and 49% at headquarters in
Washington, D.C.

International Development Association (IDA)
What Is IDA?
The International Development Association (IDA) is the part of
the World Bank that helps the world’s poorest countries. Established in
1960, IDA aims to reduce poverty by providing loans (called “credits”)
and grants for programs that boost economic growth, reduce inequalities,
and improve people’s living conditions. IDA complements the World
Bank’s original lending arm—the International Bank for Reconstruction
and Development (IBRD). IBRD was established to function as a self-
sustaining business and provides loans and advice to middle-income and
credit-worthy poor countries. IBRD and IDA share the same staff and
headquarters and evaluate projects with the same rigorous standards.
IDA is one of the largest sources of assistance for the world’s 81
poorest countries, 39 of which are in Africa. It is the single largest source
of donor funds for basic social services in these countries. IDA-financed
operations deliver positive change for 2.5 billion people, the majority of
whom survive on less than $2 a day. IDA lends money on concessional
terms. This means that IDA charges little or no interest and repayments
are stretched over 25 to 40 years, including a 5- to 10-year grace period.
IDA also provides grants to countries at risk of debt distress. In addition
to concessional loans and grants, IDA provides significant levels of debt
relief through the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative and
the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). Since its inception, IDA
has supported activities in 108 countries. Annual commitments have
increased steadily and averaged about $15 billion over the last three years,
with about 50 percent of that going to Africa. For the fiscal year ending
on June 30, 2012, IDA commitments reached $14.8 billion spread over 160
new operations.
IDA History
The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(IBRD), better known as the World Bank, was established in 1944 to
help Europe recover from the devastation of World War II. The success
270Notes
of that enterprise led the Bank, within a few years, to turn its attention
to the developing countries. By the 1950s, it became clear that the
poorest developing countries needed softer terms than those that could
be offered by the Bank, so they could afford to borrow the capital they
needed to grow. In the early 1950’s, reports from the United Nations and
the U.S. government supported the establishment of a program to lend
to poor countries on concessional terms with the backing of multilateral
donors. After initial deliberations, the idea to create the International
Development Association (IDA), an agency to provide ‘soft-loans’ to
developing countries, was floated within the Bank under the stewardship
of President Eugene Black. Monroney Resolution received support from
Democratic Senator Mike Monroney of Oklahoma, who was interested in
the provision of soft-loans for developing nations with the World Bank
as the dispenser of the aid. When appointed chairman of the Senate
Subcommittee on International Finance, he proposed what came to be
known as the Monroney Resolution.
Articles of Agreement for IDA
As the resolution was passed in the U.S. Senate, the U.S. Treasury
Secretary announced at the 1958 annual Bank and Fund meetings in New
Delhi that the U.S. was seriously studying the proposal of a Bank-based
IDA and hoped others would do the same. After consultations, which
began among the member governments of the World Bank in 1958, the
Bank’s Board of Governors at its Annual Meeting in 1959 approved a
United States resolution calling on the Bank’s Executive Directors to draft
the Articles of Agreement for IDA. Before the end of January 1960, the
Bank had circulated the Articles of Agreement to all of the members for
ratification, and received approval from member countries including the
U.S. under President Dwight D. Eisenhower.
Launch of IDA
With an initial funding of $912.7 million, IDA was launched on
September 24, 1960 with 15 signatory countries - Australia, Canada,
China, Germany, India, Italy, Malaysia, Norway, Pakistan, Sudan, Sweden,
Thailand, United Kingdom, United States, and Vietnam. Within its first
eight months of launch, IDA had 51 members and allocated credits worth
$101 million to four countries. Honduras received the first IDA credit
271Notes
for highway maintenance. Chile, Sudan, and India were the other three
recipients. IDA has grown to include 172 member countries, and has
become the leading source of concessional lending to 81 of the world’s
poorest countries, with 39 countries in Africa. Overall, 36 countries have
graduated from IDA and some have ‘reverse-graduated’ or re-entered
IDA. Since its inception, IDA credits and grants have totaled $255 billion,
averaging $15 billion a year in recent years with Africa receiving 50% of
the share.
IDA Financing
IDA funds are allocated to the recipient countries in relation to
their income levels and record of success in managing their economies and
their ongoing IDA projects. IDA’s lending terms are highly concessional,
meaning that IDA credits carry no or low interest charges.
FY12 Top 10 $
IDA Borrowers * million
India 2,733
Nigeria 1,345
Pakistan 1,290
Vietnam 1,049
Ethiopia 920
Kenya 878
Bangladesh 866
Ghana 470
Tanzania 420
Côte d’Ivoire 390
Commitments include country commitments for regional projects
and guarantees. The lending terms are determined with reference to
recipient countries’ risk of debt distress, the level of GNI per capita,
and creditworthiness for the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD) borrowing. Recipients with a high risk of debt
distress receive 100 percent of their financial assistance in the form of
272Notes
grants and those with a medium risk of debt distress receive 50 percent in
the form of grants. Other recipients receive IDA credits on regular or blend
and hard-terms with 40-year and 25-year maturities respectively. In fiscal
year 2012 (which ended June 30, 2012), IDA commitments totaled $14.8
billion (including IDA guarantees), of which 15 percent was provided on
grant terms. New commitments in FY12 comprised 160 new operations.
Since 1960, IDA has provided $255 billion to 108 countries. Annual
commitments have increased steadily and averaged about $15 billion over
the last three years. IDA-financed operations address primary education,
basic health services, clean water and sanitation, environmental safeguards,
business climate improvements, infrastructure and institutional reforms.
These projects pave the way toward economic growth, job creation, higher
incomes and better living conditions.
IDA emphasizes broad-based growth, including: a) Sound
economic policies, rural development, private business, and sustainable
environmental practices; b) Investment in people, in education and health,
especially in the struggle against HIV/AIDS, malaria, and TB; c) Expansion
of borrower capacity to provide basic services and ensure accountability
for public resources; d) Recovery from civil strife, armed conflict, and
natural disaster; e) Promotion of trade and regional integration. IDA
carries out analytical studies to build the knowledge base that allows
intelligent design of policies to reduce poverty. IDA advises governments
on ways to broaden the base of economic growth and protect the poor
from economic shocks. IDA also coordinates donor assistance to provide
relief for poor countries that cannot manage their debt-service burden.
IDA has developed a system for allocating grants based on countries’ risk
of debt distress, designed to help countries ensure debt obligations are met
(debt sustainability).

of the rural credit is disbursed by the Co-operative Banks and Regional
Rural Banks. NABARD is responsible for regulating and supervising the
functions of Co-operative banks and RRBs. In this direction NABARD has
been taking various initiatives in association with Government of India
and RBI to improve the health of Co-operative banks and Regional Rural
Banks.
278Notes
Development Action Plan (DAP)/Memorandum of Understanding
(MoU)
In order to strengthen Co-operative Credit Institutions both in
Short Term and Long Term Structures as viable units on a sustainable
basis, NABARD had introduced a mechanism of DAP/MoU aiming at
institution specific measures in 1994-95. The performance obligations
arising out of DAP formed the basis of the Memorandum of Understanding
(MoU) between stake holders. The mechanism of DAP/MoU has helped
in building appreciation and awareness for strategic planning facilitating,
in turn, sustainable viability at all levels. The feedback received indicates
that there was positive impact on the performance of banks as a result
of introduction of DAP/MoU through reduction of CoM and cost of
resources. The DAP planning process, as an internal strategy for corporate
planning, had facilitated in creating an awareness in the cooperative
banking structure and RRBs about the need for strategic planning for
corporate success.

282Notes
Small Farmers’ Agri-Business Consortium (SFAC)
Mission Statement
Indian agriculture today is essentially smallholder agriculture;
as much as 83% of all cultivators are either marginal or small (which
means that they till less than 2 hectares, or 5 acres, of land). The average
landholding size has shrunk to 1.2 hectares. Yet across a range of
parameters, from intensity of cultivation to per capita use of irrigation and
fertilizer, small and marginal farmers are more productive and efficient
than large landholders. The challenges that these small producers face can
be summed up in three words, viz., Investments, Technology and Markets.
Establishment of SFAC
Realizing that the prevailing need for creating a conducive
environment for generating rural employment and enhancing farmers
income, the then Hon’ble Finance Minister announced the decision of
Government of India’s new innovative for setting up of Small Farmer’s
Agri-Business Consortium in his budget speech for the year 1992-93 in
the following words: “Special attention needs to be paid to supporting
innovative ideas for generating income and employment in rural areas
through support to various types of agri-business”.
The setting up of the Small Farmers’ Agri-Business Consortium
(SFAC) in 1994 was a sequel to the above announcement for bringing about
and facilitating a farm-focus growth through new ventures in agro-based
industries. SFAC has emerged as a Developmental Institution with its core
aims and objectives focused on increased production and productivity,
value addition, provision of efficient linkages between producers and
consumers. SFAC deals with agriculture in its wider connotation, including
fisheries and horticulture.
Objectives
➢ ➢ 
To catalyze agro-industrial growth in the country based on the
principles of Ecological sustainability, Economic efficiency and
Social equity.
➢ ➢ 
To undertake or assist in undertaking programs for employment
283Notes
generation, growth and diversification of agriculture & agro-based
industries to increase food production and export of agriculture
products, in both primary and processed forms.
➢ ➢ 
To identify and promote post-harvest processing/manufactures
units in the public, private and cooperative sector.
➢ ➢ 
To promote organization of marketing chain both for domestic and
export marketing.
➢ ➢ 
To influence Government policies for agriculture, thereby increasing
the flow of resources and augmenting the rate of capital formation
in agriculture sector.
➢ ➢ 
To pave the way for establishment of integrated producers’
organizations with forward and backward linkages.
➢ ➢ 
To prepare, print and publish papers, periodicals, monographs in
furtherance of the objectives of the society.
Work Scope
SFAC in addition to the endeavors complying with its core
objectives, also takes up implementation of the schemes and programs
of various Government of India (GOI) Ministries and Departments
and other Financial Institutions and Banks on a service charge basis.
The SFAC society is currently implementing the following schemes and
programs viz.
➢ ➢ 
The Schematic Pattern of Assistance from SFAC, out of GOI
grants-in-aid for promotion of value addition in the hands of
farmers, through setting up part-processing, Semi-processing and
full-processing facilities, through the setting up of Agri-Business
ventures all over the country mostly in collaboration with the
private sector. and active corporation of commercial banks.
➢ ➢ 
SFAC also provides to agri-business projects involving value
addition in the hands of the farmers. Most of these projects involve
agri-partner and post harvest management, marketing etc.

option for the people of NER, taking into account the entire gamut
of horticulture development, with all backward and forward
linkages in a holistic manner.
Irrigation & Water Resources Finance Corporation (IWRFC)
In the Budget Speech for 2008-09, the Finance Minister made an
announcement that keeping in view the massive investments required
to be made in irrigation projects, Government proposes to establish the
Irrigation and Water Resources Finance Corporation (IWRFC) with an
initial capital of `.100 crore contributed by the Central Government to
mobilize the very large resources that will be required to fund major and
medium irrigation projects. In compliance with the above Announcement,
Irrigation and Water Resources Finance Corporation Limited (IWRFC)
has been set up as a Company under the Companies Act, 1956 on March
29, 2008 with an initial paid up capital of`.100 crore contributed by Central
Govt. In the Budget speech of 2012-13, Hon’ble FM has announced that ‘To
mobilize large resources to fund irrigation projects, a Government owned
Irrigation and Water Resource Finance Company is being operationalized.
The Company would start its operations in 2012-13 by focusing on
financing sub-sectors like micro-irrigation, contract farming, waste water
management and sanitation’. In pursuance of the Budget Announcement
IWRFC has been operationalized and Shri S.K. Goel, Chairman & Managing
Director, India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited (IIFCL) has been
appointed as CMD, IWRFC (Additional Charge).
Micro Finance Institutions (MFIs)
MFIs could play a significant role in facilitating inclusion, as they
are uniquely positioned in reaching out to the rural poor. Many of them
operate in a limited geographical area, have a greater understanding of the
issues specific to the rural poor, enjoy greater acceptability amongst the
rural poor and have flexibility in operations providing a level of comfort
to their clientele. There are several legal forms of MFIs. However, firm
data regarding the number of MFIs operating under different forms is not
available. It is roughly estimated that there are about 1,000 NGO-MFIs
and more than 20 Company MFIs. Further, in Andhra Pradesh, nearly
30,000 cooperative organizations are engaged in MF activities. However,
the company MFIs are major players accounting for over80% of the
microfinance loan portfolio.
285Notes
Definition of Microfinance and MFIs
The proposed Microfinance Services Regulation Bill defines micro
finance services as “providing financial assistance to an individual or an
eligible client, either directly or through a group mechanism for:
i) an amount, not exceeding rupees fifty thousand in aggregate per

ties (including for consumption purposes of such individual) or
ii) an amount not exceeding rupees one lakh fifty thousand in
aggregate per individual for housing purposes, or
such other amounts, for any of the purposes mentioned at items (i)
and (ii) above or other purposes, as may be prescribed.”

a cooperative society engaged in agricultural operations or
industrial activity or purchase or sale of any goods and services.”
MF-NBFCs as BCs
MF-NBFCs operate in a limited geographic area and have local feel.
To enable the poor to have access to savings services, MF-NBFCs may
be recognized as Business Correspondents of banks for only providing
savings and remittance services.
286Notes
Relaxation in FIPB Guidelines
➢ ➢ 
Current guidelines used by FIPB (Foreign Investment Promotion
Board) require a minimum of US$ 500,000 equity investment
from a foreign entity. NBFCs are eligible to access such funds and
leverage local capital market financing. MFNBFCs may be able to
attract social investors with relatively modest means for whom such
a high level of investment may be beyond reach. As MF-NBFCs’
initial capital needs may not be very large, the Committee is of the
view that the minimum amount of foreign equity for MF-NBFCs
may be reduced to a level of US$ 100,000.
➢ ➢ 
To facilitate raising Indian equity, NABARD may extend equity
support out of its MFDEF to such MF-NBFCs based on objective
rating / criteria. NABARD may accord priority in providing equity
support to those MF-NBFCs operating in regions featuring high
levels of exclusion.
➢ ➢ 
To further facilitate raising India equity, the SEBI Venture Capital
Guidelines may permit Venture Capital Funds to invest in MF-
NBFCs.
Tax Concessions
To facilitate build up of reserves, MF-NBFCs may be allowed,
like Housing Finance Companies and Infrastructure Companies, tax
concessions to the extent of40% of their profits, as a proportion to their
business portfolio in excluded districts as identified by NABARD without
attracting tax. For this, the Committee recommends that MF-NBFCs may
be included as eligible institutions under Section 36(1) (viii) of the Income
Tax Act.
MF-NBFCs as Micro Insurance Agents
The lives and livelihoods of poor households are full of uncovered
risk. Hence insurance is essential for them. To enable MF-NBFCs to offer
risk mitigation services to the poor, the Committee recommends that the
IRDA Micro insurance Guidelines, 2005 may permit MF-NBFCs to offer
micro insurance services as agents of regulated life and non-life insurance
companies.
287Notes
Code of Conduct
A voluntary mutual code of conduct has been prepared by some
MFIs covering aspects including mission, governance, transparency,
interest rates, handling of customer grievances, staff conduct, recovery
practices, etc. After due consultations within the sector, such code of
conduct may be made mandatory for MFIs.
Accounting and Disclosure Norms
➢ ➢ 
The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) may be
involved in formulating appropriate accounting and disclosure
norms for MFIs, so that they can generate confidence.
➢ ➢ 
The cost of funds for MFIs, their operating costs, risk premium,
etc., have to be studied for a better understanding of viable and
economic rates of interest that can be charged by them. Banks
lending to MFIs may undertake such studies and exercise a lender’s
discipline in enforcing reasonable rates of interest and acceptable
modes of recovery.
Unifying Regulatory Oversight
At present, all the regulatory aspects of microfinance are not
centralized. For example, while the Rural Planning and Credit Department
(RPCD) in RBI looks after rural lending, MF-NBFCs are under the control
of the Department of Non-Banking Supervision (DNBS) and External
Commercial Borrowings are looked after by the Foreign Exchange
Department. The Committee feels that RBI may consider bringing all
regulatory aspects of microfinance under a single mechanism. Further,
supervision of MF-NBFCs could be delegated to NABARD by RBI.
Micro Financial Sector (Development and Regulation) Bill, 2007
The Micro Financial Sector (Development and Regulation) Bill,
2007 has been introduced in Parliament in March 2007. The Committee
feels that the Bill, when enacted, would help in promoting orderly growth
of microfinance sector in India. For improving the effectiveness of the Bill,
the Committee makes the following suggestions:
288Notes
➢ ➢ 
NBFCs and Section 25 companies are left out of the purview of
the proposed Bill. NBFCs are currently regulated by RBI, though
RBI has exempted them for registration as NBFCs if they do not
take deposits. It is recommended that Section 25 companies can be
brought under the purview of this Bill.
➢ ➢ 
Cooperative societies registered under the “MACS Act” –
promulgated by some of the States – are eligible to mobilize savings
from their members. For mobilizing savings, these societies also
need to be registered with NABARD under the proposed Bill. Hence,
there is likely to be conflict between “MACS Act” and the proposed
Bill. Moreover, cooperative societies provide savings and credit
facilities to their own members. It is, therefore, suggested that the
cooperatives can be taken out of the purview of the proposed Bill.
SIDBI Foundation for Micro Credit (SFMC)
Mission
SIDBI Foundation for Micro Credit (SFMC) was launched by the
Bank in January 1999 for channelizing funds to the poor in line with
the success of pilot phase of Micro Credit Scheme. SFMC’s mission is to
create a national network of strong, viable and sustainable Micro Finance
Institutions (MFIs) from the informal and formal financial sector to
provide micro finance services to the poor, especially women.
Approach
SFMC is the apex wholesaler for micro finance in India providing a
complete range of financial and non-financial services such as loan funds,
grant support, equity and institution building support to the retailing
Micro Finance Institutions (MFIs) including two-tier MFIs so as to
facilitate their development into financially sustainable entities, besides
developing a network of service providers for the sector. SFMC is also
playing significant role in advocating appropriate policies and regulations
and to act as a platform for exchange of information across the sector. The
launch of SFMC by SIDBI has been with a clear focus and strategy to make
it as the main purveyor of micro finance in the country. Operations of
SFMC in the coming years, are not only expected to contribute significantly
towards development of a more formal, extensive and effective micro
289Notes
finance sector serving the poor in India, but also ensure sustainability at
all levels viz. at the apex level (SFMC), at the MFI level and at the client
level to ensure continuance of such arrangement. Most importantly, SFMC
has strived to create a mechanism in which there should be no barriers to
growth. Under the dispensation, there is focus on innovation and action
research.
Uniqueness
a) Rating of MFIs
Most micro finance programmes are being operated by NGOs
and are not subjected to regulation and supervision as they are registered
as Societies or Trusts. Non-regulation of these institutions has worked
to their detriment and these institutions are not able to have smooth
access to funds from the financial sector which is vary of lending to such
entities. This constraint, coupled with the fact that SFMC was launched
with a view to upscale the flow of micro credit with enabling policy
modifications relating to simplification of the procedures in availment of
assistance and substantial relaxation in the security/ collateral requirement
posed a difficult challenge. Therefore, to meet the requirements of the
revised dispensation which called for selection of suitable micro finance
intermediaries which could be trusted with bulk assistance without
collateral constraints, Capacity Assessment Rating [CAR] was introduced
by SFMC as a supplementary tool to assess the risk perception. On SFMC’s
initiative, the rating of MFIs have been started by four agencies. Till March
31, 2009, 497 ratings have been commissioned to MCRIL/ CRISIL/ CARE/
Access Development Services (ADS). SFMC has also organized trainings
on CAMEL methodology of ACCION to build the internal capacity of
SFMC officers.
b) Customized Support to MFIs
MFIs are provided annual need based assistance. One of the unique
features of the scheme is the comprehensive Capacity Building Support
being provided to the MFIs/ NGOs to expand their operations as well
as to increase their efficiency. Customized financial support comprising
of loans, capacity building grant as well as equity/ quasi equity is being
provided to the client institutions.
290Notes
c) Minimal Security Requirement
Credit worthiness is based on the rating of the borrowing institutions
rather than availability of security/ collateral requirements. Term Deposit
Receipts (TDRs) issued by Scheduled Commercial Banks/ SIDBI for an
amount equivalent to 10% /5% /2.5% (depending upon geographical area
of operation and duration of partnership with SIDBI).
d) Methodology Neutral
SIDBI’s support is not for any specific methodology. MFIs may on
lend directly to SHGs/ individuals or route their assistance through their
partner NGOs & MFIs. They may also adopt any other lending channel so
as to effectively reach financial assistance to the poor clients.
e) Capacity Building Support for the Sector
SFMC’s capacity building efforts are directed not only towards MFIs
but also towards smaller/ grass root institutions engaged in micro finance
operations, training, consultancy, rating and impact assessment etc., and
other service providers in the form of training, seminars, workshops,
orientation and exposure visits.
f) Innovation & Action Research
SIDBI has taken a number of initiatives in launching / facilitating
introduction / market-making of new concepts in the sector. The launch of
an electronic portal for information dissemination and knowledge sharing
within the sector and development of MIS software for MFIs are some such
initiatives. Other major initiatives include developing a common charter
of accounts for the sector, creating gender and environment awareness,
promoting innovations and action research on emerging concepts etc.
The environment appraisal of SFMC activities was carried out by the
Society for Participatory Research in Asia (PRA), New Delhi and covered
areas like identification of environmental risks associated with some of
the most relevant activities funded through the SFMC microfinance
route, developing a format for identifying these risks in micro-project
identification and drawing up some simple guidelines on risk mitigation.
291Notes
The appraisal covered 15 partner MFIs of the Bank located in and around
Chennai, Hyderabad, Bhubaneswar and Kolkata.
g) Opening of Specialized Microfinance Branches
Seven dedicated microfinance branches have been opened by the
Bank at Lucknow, Chennai, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Kolkata, Bhubaneswar
and Guwahati to deliver micro finance services through intermediaries
in a timely and customer-friendly manner. While Hyderabad, Chennai,
Bangalore are major hubs of microfinance activity in the country, the other
centres viz. Lucknow, Kolkata, Bhubaneswar and Guwahati have been
targeted with the primary objective of giving an impetus to microfinance
programmes in the underserved areas.
Support Offered to MFIs
a) On-lending
In keeping with its mission, SIDBI Foundation identifies, nurtures
and develops select potential MFIs as long term partners and provides credit
support for their micro credit initiatives. The eligible partner institutions
of SIDBI Foundation, therefore, comprise large and medium scale MFIs
having minimum fund requirement of ` 10 lakh per annum. Large and
medium scale MFIs having considerable experience in managing micro
credit programmes, high growth potential, good track record, professional
expertise and committed to viability are provided financial assistance for
on-lending. Under the present dispensation, annual need based assistance
is provided to enable MFIs to expand their scale of operations and achieve
self sufficiency at the earliest. Lending is based strictly on an intensive
in-house appraisal supplemented with the capacity assessment rating by
an independent professional agency. Liberal security norms have also
been adopted to reduce procedural bottlenecks as well as to facilitate easy
disbursements.
b) Capacity Building
The long-term future of the micro-finance sector depends on
MFIs being able to achieve operational, financial and institutional
sustainability. The constraints and challenges vary with the different types
292Notes
and development stage of MFIs. Most MFIs are currently operating below
operational viability and use grant funds from donors for financing up-
front costs of establishing new groups and covering initial losses incurred
until the lending volume builds up to a break-even level. The MFIs are
generally constrained in reaching a break-even level and finally achieving
sustainability, primarily due to a narrow client and product base, high
operational and administrative costs for delivering credit to the poor, and
their inability to mobilize requisite resources. Moreover, lack of technical
manpower, operational systems, infrastructure and MIS are prevalent. In
view of the above, to scale up micro-finance initiatives at a faster pace,
a special effort is required for capacity building of the Micro Finance
Institutions. In this background, SFMC has in the past under the DFID
collaboration (which has since come to an end on March 31,2009) provided
need based capacity building support to the partner MFIs, in the initial
years, to enable them to expand their operations, cover their managerial,
administrative and operational costs besides helping them achieve self-
sufficiency in due course.
c) Liquidity Management
In view of the fact that liquidity is a major concern of many of
the middle level MFIs and a small working capital support can go a long
way in their better liquidity management and thus pave way for faster
growth, SFMC has introduced a special short term loan scheme, Liquidity
Management Support (LMS) for the long term partners.
d) Equity
Provision of equity capital to the NBFC-MFIs is perceived as an
emerging requirement of the micro finance sector in India. SIDBI provides
equity capital to eligible institutions not only to enable them to meet
the capital adequacy requirements but also to help them leverage debt
funds. Keeping in tune with the sectoral requirements, the bank has also
introduced quasi-equity products viz., Optionally convertible Preference
share capital; Optionally convertible debt and Optionally convertible
Subordinate debt for new generation MFIs which are generally in the pre-
breakeven stage requiring special dispensation for capital support by way
of a mix of Tier I and Tier II capital.
293Notes
e) Transformation Loan
The Transformation Loan (TL) product is envisaged as a quasi-
equity type support to partner MFIs that are in the process of transforming
themselves / their existing structure into a more formal and regulated set-
up for exclusively handling micro finance operations in a focused manner.
Being quasi-equity in nature, TL helps the MFIs not only in enhancing
their equity base but also in leveraging loan funds and expanding their
micro credit operations on a sustainable basis. The product has the feature
of conversion into equity after a specified period of time subject to the MFI
attaining certain structural, operational and financial benchmarks. This
non-interest bearing support facilitates the young but well performing
MFIs to make long term institutional investments and acts as a constant
incentive to transform themselves into formal and regulated entities.
f) Micro Enterprise Loans
In order to build and strengthen new set of intermediaries for
Micro Enterprise Loans, the Bank has formulated new scheme for Micro
Enterprise Loans. Institutions/ MFIs with minimum fund requirement
of ` 25 lakh p.a. and having considerable experience in financial
intermediation/ facilitating or setting up of enterprises/ providing escort
services to SSI/ tiny units/ networking or active interface with SSIs etc.
and having professional expertise and capability to handle on-lending
transactions shall be eligible under the dispensation. The institutions
would be selected based on their relevant experience, potential to expand,
professional management, transparency in operations and well laid-out
systems besides qualified/ trained manpower. Lending to be based strictly
on an intensive in-house appraisal supplemented with the credit rating by
an independent professional agency. Relaxed security norms more or less
on line with micro credit dispensation to be adopted to reduce procedural
bottlenecks as well as to facilitate easy disbursements.
Micro Enterprise Loans Scheme - Direct Credit
The Micro Enterprise Loan Scheme - Direct Credit provides
need based composite loan (ranging from `50,000 to `5 lakh ) to Micro
Enterprises directly for acquiring capital assets and also for their working
capital / marketing related requirements. The assistance is covered under
the CGTMSE scheme. The scheme is currently operated by the 7 specialized
294Notes
Micro Finance Branches.
Loan Syndication
Keeping in view the increased fund requirement of major partner
MFIs, the Bank has also undertaken fee based syndication arrangement
where loan requirement is comparatively higher.

CASE STUDY
The Making of a Successful Microfinance Institution
Vikram Akula (Akula), the founder of one of the world’s fastest
growing microfinance institution (MFI), SKS Microfinance Private Limited
(SKS), was recognised by the Time magazine in its list of 100 ‘people who
shape our world’ in 2006. For Akula, who had left his job as a consultant
at McKinsey to start SKS in India, the honour came as a recognition for
the work done by SKS in providing microfinance to the poor in India, a
country which is reported to have the highest number of operating MFIs.
Vikram Akula set up SKS Microfinance Pvt. Ltd. (SKS) in 1998 to provide
microfinance to the poorest sections of the Indian society that earns a per
296Notes
capita less than INR 6,000 ($120) per year. Negating the traditional
assumption that microcredit is not a viable business in developing
countries, SKS has brought in a new micro financing model in India,
which is profitable and self-sustaining.
By reducing costs through prevention of wastage at each step of
the loan process coupled with innovative technologies and an efficient
management system, Akula has transformed SKS into one of the fastest
growing microfinance institutions in the world. By attracting capital from
global financial institutions like Citibank and through its automated MIS
system and its award winning Smart Cards Pilot Project, SKS aims to
grow at 400% per annum in the future.SKS Microfinance follows the Joint
Liability Group (JLG) model.
The methodology involves lending to individual women, using
five– member groups as the ultimate guarantor for each member. Through
group lending, situations of adverse selection and moral hazard due to
asymmetric information are better managed."Social collateral" replaces
asset collateral (which is lacking in the poorer segments of society). Such
a system works because India is still a highly community-centric society.
The concept of honour and respect within society is deeply rooted
in Indian culture and willful default invites condescending glances,
humiliation and even ostracism. The company lists some of the social
benefits of its financial product and service offerings as "providing self-
employed women financial assistance to support their business enterprises,
such as raising livestock, running local retail shops called kirana stores,
providing tailoring and other assorted trade and services.
Question
1. Evaluate the micro financing model of SKS Micro Finance Pvt. Ltd.
along with the reasons for its success.

Financial System
The word “system”, in the term “financial system”, implies a set of
complex and closely connected or interlined institutions, agents, practices,
markets, transactions, claims, and liabilities in the economy. The financial
system is concerned about money, credit and finance-the three terms are
intimately related yet are somewhat different from each other. Financial
System deals about the arrangements that can be made for raising different
types of funds required for the business so that the economic conditions
of the country can improve. It is the functioning of a healthy financial
299Notes
system on which depends the business prospects of a country. With more
expansion of business and production in the country, the service sector
will improve and more employment opportunities will be created. The
financial system helps the primary sector (the agriculture), secondary
sector (the industry) and the service sector.
Besides, Financial System deals about (a) various financial
institutions, (b) with their financial services, (c) financial markets which
enable individual, business and government concerns to raise finance; and
(d) various instruments issued in the financial markets for the purpose of
raising financial resources.
Thus, financial system consists of
➢ ➢ 
Financial Markets
➢ ➢ 
Financial Instruments/assets
➢ ➢ 
Financial Institutions/intermediaries and their services
Role of Financial System in Economic Development
The economic development of a nation is reflected by the progress of
the various economic units, broadly classified into corporate, government
and household sector. While performing their activities, these units will
be placed in a surplus/ deficit/ balanced budgetary situations. A financial
system or financial sector functions as an intermediary and facilitates the
flow of funds from the areas of surplus to the areas of deficit.
Thus, a Financial System is a composition of various institutions,
markets, regulations and laws, practices, money manager, analysts,
transactions and claims and liabilities. Economic growth and development
of any country depends upon a well-knit financial system. Financial
system comprises a set of sub-systems of financial institutions financial
markets, financial instruments and services which help in the formation
of capital. Thus a financial system provides a mechanism by which savings
are transformed into investments and it can be said that financial system
play an significant role in economic growth of the country by mobilizing
surplus funds and utilizing them effectively for productive purpose.
300Notes
The financial system is characterized by the presence of integrated,
organized and regulated financial markets, and institutions that meet
the short term and long term financial needs of both the household and
corporate sector. Both financial markets and financial institutions play
an important role in the financial system by rendering various financial
services to the community. They operate in close combination with each
other.
Functions of Financial System
A financial system performs the following functions:
a) Increase the Savings
➢ ➢ 
It provides a measure for managing and controlling the risk involved
in mobilizing savings and allocating credit.
➢ ➢ 
It promotes the process of capital formation by bringing together
the supply of saving and the demand for investible funds.
➢ ➢ 
It helps in lowering the cost of transaction and increase returns.
b) Mobilization of Savings
➢ ➢ 
It is a link between savers and investors. It utilizes mobilized savings
of savers (who are not organized /scattered) in more efficient and
effective manner.
➢ ➢ 
It provides payment mechanism for exchange of goods and services.
➢ ➢ 
It facilitate for the transfer of resources across geographic
boundaries.
➢ ➢ 
It provides detailed information to the operators/ players in the
market such as individuals, business houses, Governments etc.
c) Proper Investment
➢ ➢ 
It assists in the selection of the projects to be financed and also
reviews the performance of such projects time to time.
➢ ➢ 
It channelizes flow of saving into productive investment.
301Indian Financial System
India’s financial system is a very strong and efficient one which is
evidenced by India’s flourishing stock markets, fast-growing mutual funds,
and capable banking sector.
Indian financial system consists of financial market, financial
instruments and financial intermediation (See the figure below)

Shortcomings of Indian Financial System
The Indian financial system’s shortcomings fall largely into three areas.
➢ ➢ 
First, formal financial institutions attract only half of India’s
household savings
➢ ➢ 
Second, these financial institutions allocate more than half of
the capital to the economy’s least productive areas: state-owned
enterprises (SOEs), agriculture, and the unorganized sector (made
up mostly of tiny businesses).
➢ ➢ 
Third, since the financial system is inefficient in both of its main
task mobilizing savings and allocating capital, Indian borrowers
pay more for capital and depositors receive less than they do in
comparable economies.
302Notes
Review of Indian Financial System
Saving Trends
India has a surprisingly small share of the economy’s total capital,
despite a 130-year-old stock market, a long history of private banks, and
generally well-developed public institutions. The relative shallowness of the
financial system (measured by comparing the value of all Indian financial
assets with GDP) exemplifies the problem. The country’s financial depth is
significantly lower than that of other Asian economies, notably China. The
detailed examination revealed how much saving and investment occurs
outside the formal financial system. The country’s households save 28
percent of their disposable income at a very high rate by international
standards but invest only half of these savings in bank deposits and other
financial assets.
Of the other half, they invest 30 percent in housing and put the
remainder into machinery and equipment for the 44 million tiny household
enterprises that make up the economy’s unorganized sector. As a result,
Indian households account for 42 percent of the economy’s total physical
investment, a surprisingly high proportion. Yet with a few exceptions,
household businesses are below efficient scale, lack technology and
business know-how, and have low levels of productivity. Indian households
bought more than $10 billion worth of gold, arguably another form of
nonfinancial savings. They are now the world’s largest consumers of gold.
India’s economy would grow faster if the financial system attracted more
of the country’s savings and channelled them into larger, more productive
enterprises.
Finance to the Least Productive Investments
India’s financial system is better at allocating capital than are
its counterparts in many other emerging markets. It has some high-
performing private and foreign banks, and its stock of non-performing
loans is manageable. It has well-run equity markets that list mostly
private companies and a dynamic private corporate sector that includes
some world-class competitors, especially in business process outsourcing,
information technology, and research and development.
303Notes
The private corporate sector, as the most productive part of the
economy, should be the main recipient of funding from the financial
system. But most of the funding goes to the government and to investments
it designates as priorities. Private corporations receive just 43 percent of
the country’s total commercial credit and that level hasn’t increased since
1999. The rest goes to SOEs, agriculture, and the tiny businesses in the
unorganized sector. This pattern of capital allocation impedes growth
because SOEs are, on average, only half as productive as private ones and
require twice as much investment to achieve the same additional output.
Productivity in the agricultural and unorganized sectors is only one-
tenth as high as it is in India’s modern private sector, and their investment
efficiency is commensurately low.
Reforms that enabled the financial system to channel a larger
portion of the available credit to private companies would raise the
economy’s productivity. State-owned companies and household enterprises
would then have to improve their operations to compete successfully for
financing. If such reforms were accompanied by complementary reforms
to India’s labour and product markets, the country would get more output
for each rupee invested.
Government Control
The government’s tight control of the financial system explains its
poor allocation of capital. Regulations oblige banks and other intermediaries
to direct a high proportion of their funding to the government and its
priority investments. Banks must hold 25 percent of their assets in
government bonds, and in practice the state-owned banks that dominate
the sector choose to hold even more. Government policies require banks
to direct 40 percent of their loans to agriculture, household businesses,
and other priority sectors. Directed loans have relatively high default rates
and are costly to administer because of their small size. Besides diverting
credit from the more productive private sector, these policies reduce the
overall level of lending, since the unprofitable directed loans of banks
must expand in proportion to their discretionary loans. Banks therefore
lend just 60 percent of their deposits, compared with 83 percent for Thai,
90 percent for South Korean, and 130 percent for Chinese banks.
304Notes
The government maintains strict controls on the financial system
to achieve social-welfare objectives, such as ensuring that credit flows to
rural areas and keeping levels of public-sector employment robust. It also
uses these policies to finance a persistently large budget deficit.
Overcoming the Political Obstacles
Some of India’s regulators understandably resist reform of the
financial system because they fear that change involves risks and political
trade-offs. They worry, for instance, that the abolition of directed lending
would stifle growth in the rural economy and thus potentially increase
unemployment in the countryside. But India’s rural poor, as well as its
entrepreneurs, would be better served if the financial system could freely
allocate all available capital to more productive businesses capable of
creating jobs. These extra revenues would help the government control
its deficit and still leave money for social programs to support rural living
standards, which would no longer have to be maintained by diverting
capital from the financial system. If its total liberalization seems a step
too far, the government could, as a transitional measure, promote bank
lending to the priority areas by providing market-based incentives (such
as tax breaks or subsidies) rather than by fiat.
Costly Intermediary
The government’s influence on the financial system also lowers
its efficiency and raises the cost of financial intermediation. Apart from
China, India now has the highest level of state ownership of banks in any
major economy and even China is now seeking foreign investment in
most of its major commercial banks. The prevalence of state-owned banks
means that they experience little competitive pressure to improve the way
they operate. They meet their costs by maintaining high margins between
their lending and deposit rates. If India developed a vibrant corporate-
bond market and the financial system offered the mix of bonds and bank
loans seen in other emerging economies, companies large and small would
enjoy substantially lower funding costs. Even India’s flourishing equity
markets are constrained by heavy regulation elsewhere in the financial
sector. These markets would have still greater success if domestic financial
intermediaries, with their long-term mind-set, held more shares, but they
are now required to invest in government bonds.
305Notes
Key Reforms
An integrated program to reform the financial system could
substantially raise India’s growth rate. If the system improved its allocation
of capital, captured more savings, and reduced its operating inefficiencies,
the country’s real GDP could expand. Since many problems of India’s
financial system cut across its markets, the government must carefully
integrate the necessary reforms, which will primarily affect the banking
sector, the corporate-bond market, and domestic institutional investors. To
achieve the full potential, reforms in one area will require complementary
changes in others for instance, changes in capital account and foreign-
investment policies.
Financial Intermediation
The term financial intermediary may refer to an institution,
firm or individual who performs intermediation between two or more
parties in a financial context. Typically the first party is a provider of
a product or service and the second party is a consumer or customer.
Financial intermediaries are banking and non-banking institutions which
transfer funds from economic agents with surplus funds (surplus units) to
economic agents (deficit units) that would like to utilize those funds. FIs
are basically two types:
Bank Financial Intermediaries (BFIs - Central banks and
Commercial banks) and Non-Bank Financial Intermediaries (NBFIs -
insurance companies, mutual trust funds, investment companies, pensions
funds, discount houses and forex agencies). Financial intermediaries can
be Banks, Financial adviser or broker, Insurance Companies (life and
non-life), Mutual Funds and Pension Funds. The borrower who borrows
money from the Financial Intermediaries/Institutions pays higher amount
of interest than that received by the actual lender and the difference
between the Interest paid and Interest earned is the profit for Financial
Intermediaries/Institutions.
Financial Intermediaries are broadly classified into two major
categories:
1) Fee-based or Advisory Financial Intermediaries
2) Asset Based Financial Intermediaries
306Notes
Fee-Based/Advisory Financial Intermediaries
These Financial Intermediaries/ Institutions offer advisory
financial services and charge a fee accordingly for the services rendered.
Their services include Issue Management, Underwriting, Portfolio
Management, Corporate Counseling, Stock Broking, Syndicated Credit,
Arranging Foreign Collaboration Services, Mergers and Acquisitions,
Debenture Trusteeship and Capital Restructuring.
Asset-Based Financial Intermediaries
These Financial Intermediaries/Institutions, finance the specific
requirements of their clientele. The required infra-structure, in the form
of required asset or finance is provided for rent or interest respectively.
The financial institutions may be regulated by various regulatory
authorities. In addition, regulatory authorities may impose specific
standards of conduct requirements on financial intermediaries when
providing services to investors.
Role of Financial Intermediaries
Micro Finance
Finding innovative ways to provide financial services to the poor
so that they can improve their productive capacity and quality of life is the
role of the financial intermediaries in the 21 st century. Most of the poor
live in the rural areas, and are engaged in agricultural activities or a variety
of micro-enterprises. The poor are vulnerable to income fluctuations and
hence are exposed to risk. They are unable to access conventional credit
and insurance markets to offset this. Providing efficient micro-finance to
the poor is important. Efficient provision of savings, credit and insurance
facilities can enable the poor to smoothen their consumption, manage
risks better, gradually build assets, develop micro-enterprises, enhance
income earning capacity, and generally enjoy an improved quality of life.
Efficient micro-finance services can also contribute to improvement of
resource allocation, development of financial markets and system, and
ultimately economic growth and development.
307Notes
Restructuring of Assets
Financial intermediaries appear to have a key role in the
restructuring and liquidation of firms in distress. In particular, there
is rich evidence that financial intermediaries play an active role in the
reallocation of displaced capital, meant both as the piece-meal reallocation
of assets and, more broadly as the sale of entire bankrupt corporations to
healthy ones.
Pension Funds
Pension funds may be defined as forms of institutional investor,
which collect pool and invest funds contributed by sponsors and
beneficiaries to provide for the future pension entitlements of beneficiaries.
They thus provide means for individuals to accumulate saving over their
working life so as to finance their consumption needs in retirement, either
by means of a lump sum or by provision of an annuity, while also supplying
funds to end-users such as corporations, other households (via securitized
loans) or governments for investment or consumption.

Lesson 4.2 - Financial Markets – Primary & Secondary Markets
Learning Objectives
➢ ➢ 
To understand the components, operations and benefits of financial
markets.
➢ ➢ 
To understand the need, role and functioning of primary market.
➢ ➢ 
To understand the functioning of secondary market.
Financial Markets
In the last lesson, you have studied the components of Indian
financial system and understood that financial market is one of the
components.
Financial market is a place or a system where financial assets or
instruments are created and exchanged by market participants. One of the
barometers to measure the economic health of a nation is to look at the
efficiency of the financial market of the country. Financial markets play a
significant role in performing the resource management in an economy
through various financial assets namely equity, debt, currency and other
quasi instruments. Financial markets facilitate the price discovery and
provide liquidity of financial assets. Financial market performs the crucial
role of capital creation that is acting as a bridge between providers of
finance and the seekers of finance.
The financial assets, also called financial claims or financial
securities are issued by the seekers of finance. They issue the instruments
to investors who have surplus money to invest. Between the two parties,
there are financial intermediaries who act who act as conduits between the
investors and issuers. Thus, there are four important elements of securities
markets namely investors, issuers, intermediaries and regulators. The
issuers can be government or corporate houses. The government issues
gilt- edged securities whereas the corporate issue shares, debentures
etc., depending on the time period for which the fund is required, and
the financial instruments could be short term and long term. Depending
309Notes
on the participants, the financial markets are classified as primary and
secondary market.
Components of Financial Markets
a) Money market
The money market is a wholesale debt market for low-risk, highly-
liquid, short-term instruments. Funds are available in this market for
periods ranging from a single day up to a year. This market is dominated
mostly by government, banks and financial institutions. The following are
the money market instruments;
➢ ➢ 
Call/Notice Money
➢ ➢ 
Treasury Bills
➢ ➢ 
Term Money
➢ ➢ 
Certificate of Deposit
➢ ➢ 
Commercial Papers
i)
Call /Notice-Money Market: Call/Notice money is the money
borrowed or lent on demand for a very short period. When money
is borrowed or lent for a day, it is known as Call (Overnight)
Money. Intervening holidays and/or Sunday are excluded for this
purpose. Thus money, borrowed on a day and repaid on the next
working day, (irrespective of the number of intervening holidays)
is “Call Money”. When money is borrowed or lent for more than a
day and up to 14 days, it is “Notice Money”. No collateral security
is required to cover these transactions.
ii) Inter-Bank Term Money: Inter-bank market for deposits of
maturity beyond 14 days is referred to as the term money market.
The entry restrictions are the same as those for Call/Notice Money
except that, as per existing regulations, the specified entities are
not allowed to lend beyond 14 days.
iii) Treasury Bills: Treasury Bills are short term (up to one year)
borrowing instruments of the union government. It is an IOU
of the Government. It is a promise by the Government to pay a
stated sum after expiry of the stated period from the date of issue
(14/91/182/364 days i.e. less than one year). They are issued at a
310Notes
discount to the face value, and on maturity the face value is paid to
the holder. The rate of discount and the corresponding issue price
are determined at each auction.
iv) Certificate of Deposits: Certificates of Deposit (CDs) is a
negotiable money market instrument issued in dematerialized
form or as a Usuance Promissory Note, for funds deposited at a
bank or other eligible financial institution for a specified time
period. Guidelines for issue of CDs are presently governed by
various directives issued by the Reserve Bank of India, as amended
from time to time. CDs can be issued by
a. scheduled commercial banks excluding Regional Rural Banks
(RRBs) and Local Area Banks (LABs); and
b. Select all-India Financial Institutions that have been permitted
by RBI to raise short-term resources within the umbrella limit
fixed by RBI. Banks have the freedom to issue CDs depending
on their requirements. An FI may issue CDs within the overall
umbrella limit fixed by RBI, i.e., issue of CD together with other
instruments viz., term money, term deposits, commercial papers
and inter corporate deposits should not exceed 100 per cent of
its net owned funds, as per the latest audited balance sheet.
v)
Commercial Paper: CP is a note in evidence of the debt obligation
of the issuer. CP is thus an innovative unsecured promissory
note privately placed with investors at a discount rate to face
value determined by market forces. CP is freely negotiable by
endorsement and delivery. A company shall be eligible to issue CP
provided -
a	The tangible net worth of the company, as per the latest audited
balance sheet, is not less than `4 crore;
b The working capital (fund-based) limit of the company from
the banking system is not less than `4 crore and
c	The borrowed account of the company is classified as a Standard
Asset by the financing bank/s. The minimum maturity period
of CP is 7 days. The minimum credit rating shall be P-2 of
CRISIL or such equivalent rating by other agencies.
311Notes
b) Capital Market
Now let us look into the capital market which mainly involves
creation of long term instruments. The capital market generally consists
of the long term financial instruments. The instruments used in the equity
segment include equity shares, preference shares, convertible preference
shares, non-convertible preference shares, etc; and in the debt segment
include debentures, zero coupon bonds, deep discount bonds, etc. Section
85 of the Companies Act, 1956 permits public limited companies (having
share capital) to have two kinds of shares namely - equity and preference.
The various capital market instruments are explained below:
i)
Equity share capital: An equity interest in a company may be said
to represent a share of the company’s assets and a share of any
profits earned on those assets after other claims have been met. The
equity shareholders are the owners of the business; they purchase
shares, the money is used by the company to buy assets, the assets
are used to earn profits, which belong to the ordinary shareholders.
After satisfying the rights of preference shares, the equity shares
shall be entitled to share in the remaining amount of distributable
net profits of the company. The dividend on equity shares is not
fixed and may vary from year to year depending upon the amount
of profits available. The rate of dividend is recommended by the
Board of Directors of the company and declared by shareholders
in the Annual General Meeting. Equity shareholders have a right
to vote on every resolution placed in the meeting and the voting
rights shall be in proportion to the paid-up capital. Equity capital
can either be (i) With voting rights; or (ii) with differential rights
as to dividend, voting or otherwise in accordance with such rules
and subject to such conditions as may be prescribed.
(ii) Preference share capital: Preference share is a hybrid security
because it has features of both ordinary shares and bonds.
Preference shareholders have preferential rights in respect of
assets and dividends. In the event of winding up the preference
shareholders have a claim on available assets before the ordinary
shareholders. In addition, preference shareholders get their stated
dividend before equity shareholders can receive any dividends. The
dividends on preference shares are fixed and they must be declared
312Notes
before a legal obligation exists to pay them. The fixed nature of
dividend is similar to that of interest on debentures and bonds.
The declaration feature is similar to that of equity shareholders
dividends. The general forms of preference shares are as follows:
➢ ➢ 
Cumulative and Non-cumulative Preference Shares: The
cumulative preference share gives a right to demand the unpaid
dividend of any year, during the subsequent years when the
profits are ample.
➢ ➢ 
Cumulative Convertible Preference Shares: The cumulative
convertible preference (CCP) share is an instrument that
embraces features of both equity shares and preference shares,
but which essentially is a preference share. The CCPs are
convertible into equity shares at a future specified date at a
predetermined conversion rate once it is converted into equity
shares, it passes all the characteristics of an equity share.
➢ ➢ 
Participating and Non-participating Preference Shares:
Participating preference shares are those shares which are
entitled to a fixed preferential dividend and, in addition, carry
a right to participate in the surplus profits along with equity
shareholders after dividend at a certain rate has been paid to
equity shareholders.
➢ ➢ 
Redeemable and Irredeemable Preference Shares: Subject
to an authority in the articles of association, a public limited
company may issue redeemable preference shares to be
redeemed either at a fixed date or after a certain period of
time during the life time of the company. The Companies
Act, 1956 prohibits the issue of any preference share which is
irredeemable or is redeemable after the expiry of a period of
twenty years from the date of issue.
iii) Deferred/Founders Shares: A private company may issue deferred
or founder’s shares. Such shares are normally held by promoters
and directors of the company. That is why they are usually
called ‘founders shares’. These shares are usually of a smaller
denomination, say one rupee each. However they are generally
given equal voting rights with equity shares which may be of higher
denomination, say `10 each. Thus, by investing relatively lower
313Notes
amounts, the promoters may gain control over the management
of the company. As regards the payment of dividends to holders of
such shares, the articles usually provide that these shares will carry
a dividend fixed in relation to the profits available after dividends
have been declared on the preference and equity shares.
iv) Sweat Equity Shares: Under section 79A of the Companies Act,
1956, a company can issue sweat equity shares to its employees
or directors at discount or for consideration other than cash for
providing knowhow or making available rights in the nature of
intellectual property rights or value addition etc.
c) Hybrid Market and Instruments
Hybrid instruments have both the features of equity and debenture.
This kind of instruments is called as hybrid instruments. Examples are
convertible debentures, warrants etc. Financing from capital markets -
There are two ways a company can raise money from the financial markets
namely - Debt and Equity.
i)
Foreign Exchange Market (Forex Market): The third important
element of financial market is the forex market. The Forex market
deals with the multicurrency requirements, which are met by the
exchange of currencies. Depending on the exchange rate that is
applicable, the transfer of funds takes place in this market. This
is one of the most developed and integrated market across the
globe. In India till 1992-93 the forex market had been highly
regulated as the government had strict import- export policy.
The erstwhile FERA (Foreign exchange regulation Act) enacted
in 1973 acted tough on foreign exchange violations. From 1992
onwards, India brought in number of policy changes with respect
to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), foreign portfolio investments
and other aspects of trade. One of the important milestones was
the current account convertibility of INR (Indian Rupees). That
would mean the foreign exchange payments and receipts can be
converted at market determined rate such that individuals and
companies have the freedom to transact in foreign currency for
non-capital creation activities such as foreign travel, medical
expenses, business expenses etc., contrasting to current account
314Notes
convertibility is the capital account convertibility which involve
creation of long term assets like house properties, loan etc., Even
though the exchange rate has been market determined, from
time to time RBI intervenes in spot and forward market, if it feels
exchange rate has deviated too much.
Financial Intermediaries in the Financial Market
The financial intermediaries are operating both in organized and
unorganized sectors. The unorganized sector of the Indian financial
market consists mainly of Indigenous bankers, money lenders, Nidhi’s
and chit funds. Some of the important intermediaries operating in the
financial markets include; investment bankers, underwriters, stock
exchanges, registrars, depositories, custodians, portfolio managers,
mutual funds, financial advisors, financial consultants, primary dealers,
satellite dealers, self regulatory organizations, etc. Though the markets are
different, there may be a few intermediaries offering their services in more
than one market, e.g. underwriter. However, the services offered by them
vary from one market to another. The Table below analyzes the various
intermediaries and their role:

Primary Markets
Having learnt the difference between money market and capital
market, let us move to primary market which is one of the components of
capital market. Capital market is the place where long term requirements
of funds are met by issuing various instruments. The Primary market is
the segment in which new issues are made whereas secondary market is
the segment in which outstanding securities are traded. It is for this reason
that the Primary Market is also called new issues market or IPO (Initial
Public Offer)/FPO (Follow on Public Offer) market and the Secondary
market is called Stock Market. New issue market is not only a platform
for raising finance to establish new enterprises but also for expansion /
diversification / modernizations of existing units. The issues of shares by
the company can be classified as
(a) IPO (Initial Public Offer)
(b) FPO (Follow on Public Offer).
Functions of New Issue Market/Primary Market
The main function of new issue market is to facilitate transfer of
resources from savers to the users. The savers are individuals, commercial
banks, insurance companies, public limited companies and the government.
The new issue market plays an important role of mobilizing the funds from
the savers and transfers them to borrowers for production purposes, an
important requisite of economic growth. The main function of new issue
market can be divided into a triple service functions
(a) Origination
(b) Underwriting
(c) Distribution.
Origination
Origination refers to the work of investigation, analysis and
processing of new project proposals. Origination starts before an issue
is actually floated in the market. Technical, economic and financial
viability are studied at this stage to ensure soundness of the project. This
is a preliminary investigation undertaken by the sponsors of the issue.
316Notes
Other advisory services depending of type of issue are provided such as
magnitude, time of floating, price, methods and techniques of selling are
provided at this stage of an issue. These services improve the quality of the
issue.
Underwriting
Underwriting is an agreement whereby the underwriter promises
to subscribe to a specified number of shares or debentures or a specified
amount of stock in the event of public not subscribing to the issue. If the
issue is fully subscribed then there is no liability for the underwriter. If a
part of share issues remain unsold, the underwriter will buy the shares.
Thus underwriting is a guarantee for the marketability of shares
Method of Underwriting
An underwriting agreement may take any of the following three forms:
(i)
Standing behind the issue: Under this method, the underwriter
guarantees the sale of a specified number of shares within a
specified period. If the public do not subscribe to the specified
amount of issue, the underwriter buys the balance in the issue.
(ii) Outright purchase: The Underwriter, in this method, makes
outright purchase of shares and resale them to the investors.
(iii) Consortium method: Underwriting is jointly done by a group of
underwriters in this method. The underwriters form a syndicate
for this purpose. This method is adopted for large issue.
Advantages of Underwriting
Underwriting assumes great significance as it offers the following
advantages to the issuing company.
➢ ➢ 
The issuing company is relieved from the risk of finding buyers for
the issue offered to the public. The company is assured of raising
adequate capital.
➢ ➢ 
The company is assured of getting minimum subscription within
the stipulated time, a statutory obligation to be fulfilled by the
issuing company.
317Notes
➢ ➢ 
Underwriters undertake the burden of highly specialized function
of distributing securities.
➢ ➢ 
Provide expert advice with regard to timing of security issue, the
pricing of issue, the size and type of securities to be issued etc.
➢ ➢ 
Public confidence on the issue enhances when underwritten by
reputed underwriters.
The underwriters in India may be classified into two categories:
➢ ➢ 
Institutional underwriters
➢ ➢ 
Non – institutional underwriters.
The Institutional Underwriters are
➢ ➢ 
Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC)
➢ ➢ 
Unit Trust of India (UTI)
➢ ➢ 
Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI)
➢ ➢ 
Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India (ICICI)
➢ ➢ 
Commercial banks and general insurance companies.
The pattern of underwriting of the above institutional underwriters
differs vastly in India. LIC and UTI have purchased industrial securities
from the new issue market with a view to hold them on their own
portfolio. They have a preference for underwriting shares in large and well
established firms. The development banks have given special attention to
the issues in backward states and industries in the priority list. The thrust
of the development banks is also towards small and new issues which do
not have adequate support from other institutions. General insurance
companies have shown preference in underwriting the securities of fairly
new issues.
The non-institutional underwriters are brokers. They guarantee
shares only with a view to earn commission from the company floating
the issue. They are known to-off load the shares later to make a profit. The
brokers work profit motive in underwriting industrial securities. After the
elimination of forward trading, stock exchange broker has begun to take
an underwritten to the total private capital issue varies between 72 percent
to 97 percent.
318Notes
Distribution
Distribution is the function of sale of securities to ultimate investors.
This service is performed by brokers and agents who maintain regular and
direct contact with the ultimate investors.
Methods of floating of new issues: The various methods which are
used in the floating of securities in the new issue market are:
➢ ➢ 
Public issues
➢ ➢ 
Offer for sale
➢ ➢ 
Placement
➢ ➢ 
Rights issues
The following figure shows the classification of issues:

Figure showing the Classification of issues
i)
Public issues: Under this method, the issuing company directly
offers to the general public/institutions a fixed number of shares
at a stated price through a document called prospectus. This is
the most common method followed by join stock companies to
raise capital through the issues of securities. According to the
companies act, 1956 every application form must be accompanied
by a prospectus. Now, it is no longer necessary to furnish a copy
of the prospectus along with every application forms as per the
companies Amendment Act, 1988. Now, an abridged prospectus is
being annexed to every share application form.
319Notes
Merits of Issue Through Prospectus
➢ ➢ 
Sale through prospectus has the advantage of inviting a large section
of the investing public through advertisement.
➢ ➢ 
It is a direct method and no intermediaries are involved in it.
➢ ➢ 
Shares, under this method, are allotted to a large section of
investors on a non-discriminatory basis. This procedure helps in
wide dispersion of shares and to avoid concentration of wealth in
few hands.
Demerits of Issue Through Prospectus
➢ ➢ 
It is an expensive method. The company has to incur expenses
on printing of prospectus, advertisement, banks’ commission,
underwriting commission, legal charges, stamp duty, listing fees
and registration charges.
➢ ➢ 
This method is suitable only for large issues.
ii) Offer for sale: The method of offer of sale constitute outright sale
of securities through the intermediary of issue houses or share
brokers. In other words, the shares are not offered to the public
directly. This method consist of two stages: the first stage is a
direct sale by the issuing company to the issue house and brokers
at an agreed price. In the second stage, the intermediaries resell
the above securities to the ultimate investors. The issue houses
or stock brokers purchase the securities at a negotiated price and
resell at a higher price. The difference in the purchase and sale
price is called turn or spread.
Advantages: The advantages of this method are that the company
is relieved from the problem of printing and advertisement of prospectus
and making allotment of shares. Offer of sale is not common in India. This
method is used generally in two instances:
➢ ➢ 
Offer by a foreign company of a part of it to Indian investors.
➢ ➢ 
Promoters diluting their stake to comply with requirements of stock
exchange at the time of listing of shares.
iii) Follow on Public Offering (FPO): When an existing listed
company either makes a fresh issue of securities to the public or
320Notes
makes an offer for sale of securities to the public for the first time,
through an offer document, such issues are called as ‘Follow on
Public Offering’. Such public issue of securities or offer for sale to
public is required to satisfy the stock exchange listing obligations
along with SEBI guidelines.
iv) Rights Issue (RI): When a listed company proposes to issue
securities to its existing shareholders, whose names appear in the
register of members on record date, in the proportion to their
existing holding, through an offer document, such issues are called
‘Rights Issue’. This mode of raising capital is best suited when the
dilution of controlling interest is not intended.
v)
Preferential Issue: A preferential issue is an issue of equity shares
or of convertible securities by listed companies to a select group of
persons which is neither a rights issue nor a public issue. The issuer
company has to comply with the provisions of the Companies Act,
as well as, SEBI’s guidelines with reference to preferential issues. A
company which makes any public or rights issue or an offer for sale
can issue shares only in dematerialized form. A company shall not
make a public or rights issue of shares unless all the existing partly
paid shares have been fully paid-up or forfeited. A company which
is making public issue of securities shall make an application to
the stock exchange for listing of those shares.
Book Building
It is a capital issuance process which results towards a price
discovery and also to assess demand analysis of the security. It is a process
used for marketing equity shares of a company. The book building process
includes the following steps
➢ ➢ 
The Issuer nominates a merchant banker as book runner.
➢ ➢ 
Specifies issue size and floor price
➢ ➢ 
Appoints syndicate members
➢ ➢ 
Investors place orders into the electronic book, termed as the
process of bidding • Bids are entered, ‘at’ or ‘above’ the floor price
➢ ➢ 
Retail investors can bid at a cut-off price
➢ ➢ 
The price opted by majority of bidders shall be decided as the
subscription price.

Eligibility Norms for Public Issue
SEBI has laid down the eligibility norms for entities accessing the
primary market through public issues. The entry norms for companies
making initial public offer or Follow on Public offer, are summarized as
follows (students are advised to refer to SEBI guidelines to have the latest
norms):
Entry Norm I
The company shall meet the following requirements:
➢ ➢ 
Pre-issue net worth of the co. should not be less than `1 crore in
last 3 out of last 5 years with minimum net worth to be met during
immediately preceding 2 years and
➢ ➢ 
track record of distributable profits for at least three (3) out of
immediately preceding five (5) years and
➢ ➢ 
the issue size (i.e. offer through offer document + firm allotment +
promoters’ contribution through the offer document) shall not
exceed five (5) times its pre-issue net worth.
In case an unlisted company does not satisfy any of the above criteria,
it can come out with a public issue only through the Book-Building process.
In the Book Building process the company has to compulsorily allot at least
322Notes
sixty percent (60%) of the issue size to the Qualified Institutional Buyers
(QIBs), failing which the full subscription monies shall be refunded
➢ ➢ 
If change in name, at least 50% revenue for preceding 1 year should
be from the new activity.
➢ ➢ 
The issue size does not exceed 5 times the pre-issue net worth.
To provide sufficient flexibility and also to ensure that genuine
companies do not suffer on account of rigidity of the parameters, SEBI has
provided two other alternative routes to company not satisfying any of the
above conditions, for accessing the primary market.
Entry Norm II
➢ ➢ 
Issue shall be through book building route, with at least 50% to be
mandatorily allotted to the Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs).
➢ ➢ 
The minimum post-issue face value capital shall be `10 crores or
there shall be a compulsory market-making for at least 2 years or
Entry Norm III
➢ ➢ 
The ‘project’ is appraised and participated to the extent of 15% by
FIs/Scheduled commercial banks of which at least 10% comes from
the appraiser(s).
➢ ➢ 
The minimum post-issue face value capital shall be `10 crores or
there shall be a compulsory market-making for at least 2 years In
addition to satisfying the aforesaid eligibility norms, the company
shall also satisfy the criteria of having at least 1000 prospective
allottees in its issue.
Green Shoe Option
Green Shoe Option denotes ‘an option of allocating shares in
excess of the shares included in the public issue’. It is an option allowing
the Issuing Company to issue additional shares when the demand is high
for the shares when the flotation is on. SEBI guidelines allows the Issuing
company to accept oversubscription, subject to a ceiling, say 15% of the
offer made to public. In certain cases, the Green Shoe Option can be even
more than 15%. It is extensively used in international IPOs to stabilize the
323Notes
post listing price of new issued shares. The concept has been introduced
in the Indian capital market and is used in initial public offerings through
book building process. SEBI has allowed the use of the option with a view to
boost the investors’ confidence and to put a check for speculative practices
causing short-term volatility in post listing price. The Green Shoe Option
facility would bring in price stability of initial public offerings.
Kinds of Offer Documents
An offer document means ‘prospectus’ in case of a public issue or an
offer for sale and ‘Letter of offer’ in case of rights issue, which is required
to be filed with the Registrar of Companies (ROC) and Stock Exchanges.
An offer document covers all the relevant information to help an investor
in making wise investment decisions.
Draft Prospectus
A company before making any public issue of securities shall file a
draft prospectus with SEBI, through an eligible merchant banker, at least
21 days prior to the filing of prospectus with the Registrar of Companies.
If any specific changes are suggested by SEBI within the said 21 days, the
Issuing Company or the lead merchant banker shall carryout such changes
in the draft prospectus before filing the prospectus with ROC.
Draft Letter of Offer
A listed company, before making any rights issue for an amount
exceeding `50 lakhs (including premium) shall file a draft letter of offer
with SEBI, at least 21 days prior to the filing of the letter of offer with
regional stock exchange and shall carry changes as suggested by SEBI
before the filing of the draft letter of offer with regional stock exchange.
Prospectus
A company issuing shares to public must issue a ‘prospectus’. The
prospectus is an ‘invitation’ to offer. It is an invitation to the public to take
shares or debentures in the company or deposit money in the company.
Section 2(36) of the Companies Act, 1956 defines prospectus as “any
document described or issued as a prospectus and includes any notice,
circular, advertisement or other document inviting deposits from the
324Notes
public or inviting offers from the public for the subscription or purchase
of any shares in, or debentures of, a body corporate”.
Abridged Prospectus
Section 2(1) of the Companies Act, 1956 defines abridged
prospectus means ‘a memorandum containing such salient features of
a prospectus as may be prescribed’. An abridged prospectus means the
memorandum as prescribed in Form 2A under sub-section (3) of section
56 of the Companies Act. It contains all the salient features of a prospectus.
A company cannot supply application forms for shares or debentures
unless the form is accompanied by abridged prospectus.
Shelf Prospectus
Sometimes, securities are issued in stages spread over a period of
time, particularly in respect of infrastructure projects where issue size is
large as huge funds have to be collected. In such cases, filing of prospectus
each time will be very expensive. In such cases, section 60A of the
Companies Act, 1956 allows a prospectus called ‘Shelf Prospectus’ to be
filed with Registrar of Companies. At subsequent stages only ‘Information
Memorandum’ is required to be filed. The shelf prospectus shall be valid
for a period of 1 year from the date of opening of first issue of securities
under that prospectus.
Information Memorandum
The Information Memorandum shall contain all material facts
relating to new charges created, changes in the financial position as
have accrued between the first offer, previous offer and the succeeding
offer. The Information Memorandum shall be filed with a period of 3
months prior to making of second or subsequent offer of securities under
Shelf Prospectus. The Information Memorandum shall be issued to the
public along with Shelf Prospectus filed at the first stage of offer. Where
an update of Information Memorandum is filed every time an offer of
securities is made, such memorandum together with the Shelf Prospectus
shall constitute the Prospectus.
325Notes
Red-Herring Prospectus
A prospectus is said to be a red-herring prospectus which contains
all information as per prospectus contents but does not have information
on price of securities offered and number of securities (quantum) offered
through such document. Thus, a red-herring prospectus lacks price and
quantity of the securities offered. This is used in book building issues
only. In the case of book built issues, it is a process of price discovery
and the price cannot be determined until bidding process is completed.
Hence, such details are not shown in Red-herring prospectus filed with
ROC in terms of the provisions of the Companies Act. Only on completion
of the bidding process, the details of the final price are included in the
offer document. The offer document filed thereafter with ROC is called a
‘prospectus’.
Secondary Markets
Secondary market, popularly known as stock exchange is the place
where the issued shares and other instruments are traded for subsequent
sale. One of the criteria in investment management which is considered as
very important next to risk assessment is the liquidity. After the investors
get the shares allotted through the primary market they need some platform
or market place to provide liquidity for their investment. Thus, secondary
market offers liquidity to investment made in the primary market. Both,
primary and secondary markets co-exist, i.e. to say one depends on the
other for its survival and growth.
There are two broad segments of the stock markets
➢ ➢ 
The organised stock exchanges and
➢ ➢ 
The Over-the-Counter (OTC) market.
The primary middlemen in the stock market are brokers and
dealers. The distinction between them is, the broker acts as an agent,
whereas the dealer acts as a principal in the transaction. Stock markets are
said to reflect the overall health of the country’s economy. On the other
hand, major economic indicators determine stock market movements to a
large extent. From a thorough analysis of the various economic indicators
and its implications on the stock markets, it is known that stock market
326Notes
movements are largely influenced by broad money supply, inflation, credit/
deposit ratio and fiscal deficit apart from political stability.
Besides, fundamentals, factors like corporate performance,
industrial growth, etc. always exert a certain amount of influence on the
stock markets. Because the stock market involves the trading of securities
initially sold in the primary market, it is providing liquidity to the
individuals who acquired these securities. The trends in stock market will
have impact on the primary market.
The secondary market in India comprises of 23 Stock Exchanges
and more than 10000 listed companies out of which BSE has about 4888
and NSE has1225 companies listed with them as on 29th February 2008.
A large volume of transactions on the secondary markets are transacted
through BSE and NSE. Presently, the BSE & NSE put together account for
more than 99% of the total turnover as compared to less than 1% by the
other Stock Exchanges.
Role of Secondary Market
There are two main reasons why individuals transact in the
secondary market: Information Motivated Reasons: Information
motivated investors believe that they have superior information about
a particular security than other market participants. This information
leads them to believe that the security is not being correctly priced by
the market. If the information is good, this suggests that the security is
currently under-priced, and investors with access to such information will
want to buy the security. On the other hand, if the information is bad, the
security will be currently overpriced, and such investors will want to sell
their holdings of the security.
Liquidity Motivated Reasons: Liquidity motivated investors, on the
other hand, transact in the secondary market because they are currently in
a position of either excess or insufficient liquidity. Investors with surplus
cash holdings (e.g., as a result of an inheritance or adequate savings of
their income) will buy securities, where as investors with insufficient cash
(e.g., to purchase a car or any other assets) will sell their securities.
327Notes
Types of Securities in the Stock Market
The Securities which are traded in the secondary market may be
classified as follows.
On the Basis of Issuer
Securities may be classified as Industrial securities, Government
securities and financial intermediaries securities.
a) 
Industrial securities issued by industrial and common undertakings
in the private and public sector whereas government securities
include securities issued by State governments, municipalities and
public utilities.
b) 
Government securities are generally considered risk-free, low return
securities compared to the Industrial securities.
c) 
Financial Intermediaries Securities: Besides these two classes of
issues, the Financial Intermediaries are emerging as the third
important group. The securities issued by Financial Institutions
and Banks would fall, in terms of risk-return features, somewhere
in between the industrial securities and government securities.
On the Basis of Maturity
Securities may be classified into short term and long term or
Money Market and Capital Market securities. Treasury bills, commercial
bills, commercial papers, certificate of deposits are short- term or money
market securities. Equities, Preference shares, Debentures and Bonds are
long term or capital market securities.
On the Basis of Settlement of Deals
Securities may be classified into Forward securities and Cash
securities. Forward securities are those in which the settlement date can
be shifted from one settlement date to other by paying the badla charges.
Cash securities are those for which settlement dates cannot be shifted.
The Forward securities are known by different names viz. specified shares
or group A shares or Forward section. Cash securities are also known as
Non-specified shares or group B shares or cash section.

Stock Market in India
From scattered and small beginnings in the 19 th Century, India’s
stock market has risen to great heights. In 1990, we had 19 stock exchanges
in the country. There were around 6,000 listed companies and the invested
population stood around 15 million. You might be interested in knowing
more about the growth of stock market in India. What functions does it
perform? What is the form of organization of stock exchange in India?
How are they administered? What is the trading system followed on these
exchanges? We shall discuss these and other questions in the following
sections.
Role and Functions of Stock Exchanges
The history of stock exchanges shows that the development of
joint stock enterprise would never have reached its present stage but
for the facilities which the stock exchanges provide for dealing with the
securities. Stock exchanges have a very important function to fulfill in
the country’s economy. The stock exchange is really an essential pillar of
the private sector corporate economy. It discharges essential functions in
the process of capital formation and in raising resources for the corporate
sector.
Liquidity and Marketability of Securities
The stock exchange provides a market place for purchase and sale
of securities viz., shares, bonds, debentures etc. It, therefore, ensures the
free transferability of securities which is the essential basis for the stock
enterprise system. The private sector economy cannot function without
the assurance provided by the exchange to the owners of shares and
bonds that they can be sold in the market at any time. At the same time,
those who invest their surplus funds in securities for long-term capital
appreciation or for speculative purpose can also buy scripts of their choice
in the market.
Capital Formation
The stock exchange provides the linkage between the savings in the
household sector and investment in corporate economy. It mobilizes savings,
329Notes
and channelizes them in the form of securities into those enterprises which
are favoured by the investors on the basis of such criteria as future growth
prospects, good returns and appreciation of capital.
Fair Price Determination
By providing a market quotation of the prices of shares and bonds (a
sort of collective judgement simultaneously reached by many buyers and
sellers in the market), the stock exchange serves the role of barometer, not
only of the state of health of individual companies, but also of the nation’s
economy.
The changes in share prices are brought about by a complex set
of factors, all operating in the market simultaneously. Share values as a
whole are subject to secular trends set by the economic programme of the
nation, and governed by factors like general economic situation, financial
and monetary policies, tax changes, political environment, international -
economic and financial development, etc.
Membership, Organization and Management
Natures of the century-old traditional stock exchanges are a
highly organized and smoothly functioning network in the world. The
membership of stock exchanges initially comprised of individuals and
partnership firms. Later on the corporate entities and financial institutions
were also allowed to become members. A number of financial institutions
are now members of Indian Stock Exchanges.
Over the years, stock exchanges have been initiated in various
forms. For example, while the Ahmedabad Stock Exchange and M.P.
(Indore) Stock Exchange were started as Non-profit making association
of persons, the Calcutta Stock Exchange, Delhi Stock Exchange, U.P. Stock
Exchange, Cochin Stock Exchange, Gauhati Stock Exchange, Bangalore
Stock Exchange, Jaipur Stock Exchange and (Mangalore) Stock Exchange
were established as public limited companies. Quite a few others have been
started as Company limited by guarantee.
The entrance fee is different for different stock exchanges.
Membership deposit and annual fees also varies from exchange to
exchange. The entrance fee is different for different members among
various exchanges based on their status like individual or corporate.
330Notes
The internal governance of exchange rests in a governing board
comprising members of the board and Executive Director. The Members
of the governing boards include brokers and SEBI Nominees called Public
Representatives.
The Chairman is expected to ensure the position of Executive
Director can’t be expected to be very strong because if he really tries to
be may bring him into conflict with influential broker-members who may
also be on the exchange’s board which determines Executive Director’s
terms and conditions of service and his re-appointment on this term. It
is not human nature to displease one’s appointing authorities and it may
be too much Executive Director’s to be strict under the present scheme of
things. Subject to the previous approval of the law, governing bodies of
stock exchanges have wide powers to make bye-laws. Governing bodies
furnish, censure and also expel any member, and authorized clerk and
employee. It has to adjudicate disputes. Above all, it has the power to
make, amend, suspend and enforce rules, bye-regulations and supervises
the entire functioning of a stock exchange.
To rationalize the functioning of the stock exchanges during
the year 2007 all the exchanges in India were de-mutualized under a
compulsory scheme brought out by SEBI in the year 2005. Except NSE
all other exchanges were managed by the brokers who were members of
the exchange by having major stake in the composition of the Governing
Board.
After the demutualization, management of the exchange rests with
the owners (non-brokers) with more than 50% representation in the board
and minority representation of the Trading Members and SEBI nominees.
All the exchanges have become from Not-for profit organization to that of
for-profit organizations. Those exchanges which have failed to complete
the demutualization within the stipulated time frame as given by SEBI
were cancelled of their recognition as an exchange and hence, they have
lost their identity as exchange and cease to exist.
Trading System
Trading on stock exchanges is done through brokers and dealers.
All members can act as brokers and for this purpose they have to maintain
331Notes
a minimum security deposit and additional security deposit also called
as base capital which will decide on the trading exposure that the said
broker will be allowed to. Brokers act as agents for buying and selling on
behalf of their clients, for which they receive brokerage/commission at
stipulated rates.
The maximum brokerage that can be charged is restricted to 2.5%
of the value of transaction done and there is no minimum stipulated but
it cannot be nil, except when the transactions are done for charitable
organizations. Dealers act as principals and buy and sell securities on
their own accounts. However, members cannot enter into contract with
any person other than the member without prior permission of the
governing Body.
The Trading system of NSE has enhanced its efficiency, liquidity
and transparency, by introducing a nation-wide online fully-automated
screen based trading system (SBTS) where a member can input into the
computer trading terminal, the quantities of the securities he wanted to
buy or sell and the prices at which he likes to transact and the transaction
is executed as soon as it finds a matching sale or buy order from a counter
party. SBTS electronically matches orders on a strict price/time priority
and hence cuts down on time, cost and risk of error, as well as on fraud
resulting in improved operational efficiency.
It allows faster incorporation of price sensitive information into
prevailing prices, thus increasing the informational efficiency of markets.
It enables market participants, irrespective of their geographical locations,
to trade with one another simultaneously, improving the depth and li-
quidity of the market. It provides full anonymity by accepting orders, big
or small, from members without revealing their identity, thus providing
equal access to everybody. It also provides a perfect audit trail, which helps
to resolve disputes by logging in the trade execution process in entirety.
An Overview of Stock Exchanges in India
a) Bombay Stock Exchange of India Ltd.
The Bombay Stock Exchange is known as the oldest exchange in
Asia. It traces its history to the 1850s, when stockbrokers would gather
under banyan trees in front of Mumbai’s Town Hall. The location of
332Notes
these meetings changed many times, as the number of brokers constantly
increased. The group eventually moved to Dalal Street in 1874 and in
1875 became an official organization known as ‘The Native Share & Stock
Brokers Association’. In 1956, the BSE became the first stock exchange to
be recognized by the Indian Government under the Securities Contracts
Regulation Act.
The Bombay Stock Exchange developed the BSE Sensex in 1986,
giving the BSE a means to measure overall performance of the exchange.
In 2000 the BSE used this index to open its derivatives market, trading
Sensex futures contracts. The development of Sensex options along with
equity derivatives followed in 2001 and 2002, expanding the BSE’s trading
platform. Historically an open-cry floor trading exchange, the Bombay
Stock Exchange switched to an electronic trading system in 1995. It took
the exchange only fifty days to make this transition.
b) National Stock Exchange of India Ltd
The National Stock Exchange of India Limited (NSE) was
promoted by IDBI, ICICI, IFCI, GIC, LIC, State Bank of India, SBI Capital
Markets Limited, SHCIL and IL & FS as a Joint Stock Company under
the Companies Act, 1956, on November 27,1992. The Government of
India has granted recognition with effect from April 26,1993, initially for
a period of five years. The GOI has appointed IDBI as a lead promoter. To
form the infrastructure of NSE, IDBI had appointed a Hongkong Bound
consulting firm M/s. International Securities Consulting Limited for
helping in setting up of the NSE.
The main objective of NSE is to ensure comprehensive nationwide
securities trading facilities to investors through automated screen based
trading called NEAT and automatic post trade clearing and settlement
facilities. The NSE encourages corporate trading members with dealer
networks, computerized trading and short settlement cycles. It has three
segments, one dealing with wholesale debt instruments, the second to
deal with capital market instruments called cash segment and the third
for Futures and Options or Derivatives Market. The Clearing Corporation
of India Limited (CCIL) an Electronic Clearing and Depository System
(ECDS) set up by the Stock Holding Corporation of India Limited
(SHCIL) provides the requisite clearing and settlement systems. The
333Notes
recommendations of the High Power Committee on setting up of the
National Stock Exchange, a ‘Model Exchange’ at New Mumbai to act as
a National Stock Exchange (NSE) to provide access to all investors from
across the country on an equal footing, and work as Integral component
of the National Stock Market System. Hence, NSE is having the following
vital features:
➢ ➢ 
NSE is promoted by Financial Institutions, Mutual Funds, and
financed on a self-sustaining basis through levy of membership
fees. The capital outlay of 30 crores of rupees was financed by
admitting 1,000 members with an entry fee of `10 lakhs each. Fees
for corporate and Institutional members were at a higher level of
`25 lakhs.
➢ ➢ 
NSE is a company incorporated under the Companies Act of 1956.
It is constituted by the Board of Directors (Board) and managed
by it. 50 per cent of the Managing Board of the Exchange comprise
of professionals who are not members. These professionals must
be from a cross section of finance and industry, and must actively
contribute to ensuring that the stock exchange functions in a
balanced and fair manner.
➢ ➢ 
It is trading on large & medium sized securities of equity shares and
debt instruments.
➢ ➢ 
It is a separate ring altogether. For the first time in our country, debt
instruments were traded to become an active part in the secondary
market of the nation.
➢ ➢ 
NSE made its debut with the debt market. The debt market is
predominantly a market in Government Securities. The Central
Government moving over to auctions at market-related rates
of interest, the primary market has become active with the well
informed and fine-tuned bidding at the auctions.
➢ ➢ 
It is having full support from the National Clearing and Settlement
divisions, SHCIL and the Securities Facilities Support Corporation.
It is using modern computer technology for the clearance and
settlement procedures.
➢ ➢ 
Better transparency system for the securities trading & settlement.
334Notes
In the very first year of its operation, NSE became the leading stock
exchange in the country, impacting the fortunes of other exchanges and
forcing them to adopt SBTS also. Today India can boast that almost 100%
trading take place through electronic order matching. Technology was
used to carry the trading platform from the trading hall of stock exchanges
to the premises of brokers. NSE carried the trading platform further to the
PCs at the residence of investors through the Internet and to handheld
devices through WAP for convenience of mobile investors. This made a
huge difference in terms of equal access to investors in a geographically
vast country like India.
The trading network is depicted in above. NSE has main computer
which is connected through Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT)
installed at its office. The main computer runs on a fault tolerant STRATUS
mainframe computer at the Exchange. Brokers have terminals installed at
their premises which are connected through VSATs/leased lines/modems.
An investor informs a broker to place an order on his behalf. The broker
enters the order through his PC, which runs under Windows NT and sends
signal to the Satellite via VSAT/leased line/modem. The signal is directed
to mainframe.
Both BSE and NSE have national presence and they dominate the
stock markets. All other exchanges have created a platform by having
either an alliance with or cross holding with these two premier exchanges
or trading facility provided to their members through a subsidiary of the
main exchanges.
c) Over The Counter Exchange of India (OTCEI)
Indeed in mid-eighties itself the G.S. Patel Committee on Stock
Exchange reforms and the Abid Holi Committee on Capital Markets had
recommended for the creation of a second tier stock market that will
solve some of the problems of present stock exchanges. Over The Counter
Exchange of India (OTCEI) was been promoted by, UTI, IDBI, IFCI, LIC,
GIC, SBI Capital Market and Canbank Financial Services as a non profit-
making company under Section 25 of the Companies Act, 1956. The
OTCEI is a recognized Stock Exchange under section 4 of the Securities
Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956. Hence companies listed on the OTC
Exchange enjoy the same status as companies listed on any other stock
exchanges in the country.
335Notes
OTC Exchange of India has picked the model from the NASDAQ
system (National Association of Security Dealers-Automated Quotations)
prevalent in the United States of America. Modifications suited to Indian
conditions been adopted from OTC in America was an offshoot of their
government’s efforts to regulate the unlisted securities act. The Indian
version of NASD National Associations of Securities Dealers is what is
called OTC Exchange of India. Unlike in the regular exchange, listing on
OTCEI is a national listing from day one.
Wherever and whenever counters start operating in the country
they can trade in all the scripts of OTCEI. Separate listing in those regular
places is not needed at all. All said and done the OTCEI did not take off
and was not successful due to many reasons like lower end technology, low
liquidity, less participation by investors in small cap companies, etc.
d) Inter-connected Stock Exchange of India
Inter-connected Stock Exchange of India Limited (ISE), has been
promoted by 15 Regional stock exchanges to provide trading linkage/
connectivity to all the participating exchanges to widen their market. Thus,
ISE is a national level exchange providing trading, clearing, settlement,
risk management and surveillance support to the Inter-Connected Market
System (ICMS).
ISE aims to address the needs of small companies and retail
investors with the guiding principle of optimizing the infrastructure and
harnessing the potential of regional markets to transform these into a
liquid and vibrant market through the use of technology and networking.
The participating exchange in ISE has in all about 4500 traders.
In order to leverage its infrastructure as also to expand its nation-
wide reach, ISE has also appointed dealers across various cities other than
the participating exchange centres. These dealers are administratively
supported through strategically located regional offices at Delhi, Calcutta,
Chennai and Nagpur.
ISE, thus expects to emerge as a low cost national level exchange
in the country for retail investors and small intermediaries. ISE has also
floated a wholly-owned subsidiary namely, ISE Securities and Services
336Notes
Limited (ISS) to take membership of NSE and other premier exchanges, so
that traders and dealers of ISE can access other markets in addition to the
local market and ISE.
This will provide the investors in smaller cities with a solution
for cost-effective and efficient trading in securities. Core objectives of
the Inter-connected Stock Exchange include creation of single integrated
national level solution with access to multiple markets for providing high
quality, low cost services to millions of investors across the country, a
liquid and vibrant national level market for all listed companies in general
and small capital companies in particular and providing trading, clearing
and settlement facilities to the traders and dealers across the country at
their doorstep with decentralized support system. Some of the features
which make ISE a new age stock exchange are as follows:
➢ ➢ 
ISE is a national level recognised stock exchange having moderate
listing fees and granting listing and trading permission to small and
medium sized companies having a post public issue paid-up capital
of ` 3 crore to ` 5 crore (subject to the appointment of market
makers) besides companies with a capital of above ` 5 crore.
➢ ➢ 
All traders and dealers of ISE have access to NSE through ISE
Securities and Services Ltd. (ISS), which ensures continuous
attention of investors.
➢ ➢ 
Proposing to introduce the ‘IPO Distribution System’ for offering
primary market issue.
➢ ➢ 
ISE has set up an ‘Investors Grievance and Service Cell’ which looks
after all types of complaints of investors located across the country
and provides decentralised support.
➢ ➢ 
Listing of stocks with ISE would give the company an advantage
of being identified as a technology-savvy and Investor-friendly
company.
Demutualization of Stock Exchanges
Historically stock exchanges were formed as ‘mutual’ organizations,
which were considered beneficial in terms of tax benefits and matters of
compliance. They are generally ‘not-for-profit’ and tax exempted entities.
337Notes
The trading members who provide broking services, also own, control and
manage such exchanges for their common benefit, but do not distribute
the profits among themselves. The ownership rights and trading rights are
clubbed together in a membership card which is not freely transferable
and hence this card at times carries a premium. In contrast, in a ‘demutual’
exchange, three separate sets of people own the exchange, manage it and
use its services.
The ownership usually vests in management constituting a board of
directors which is assisted by a professional team. A completely different
set of people use trading platform of the exchange. These are generally ‘for-
profit’ and taxpaying entities. The ownership rights are freely transferable.
Trading rights are acquired / surrendered in terms of transparent rules.
Membership cards do not exist. These two models of exchanges are
generally referred to as ‘club’ and ‘institution’ respectively.
The most important development in the capital market is
demutualization of the stock exchanges. Demutualization means
segregating the ownership from management. This move was necessitated
by the fact that brokers in the management of the stock exchange were
misusing their position for personal gains. Demutualization would bring
in transparency and prevent conflict of interest in the functioning of the
stock exchanges. Now, all the stock exchanges in India are demutualised
entities.

Mutual Funds
A mutual fund is a type of professionally managed collective
investment vehicle that pools money from many investors to purchase
securities. While there is no legal definition of the term “mutual fund”, it
is most commonly applied only to those collective investment vehicles that
are regulated and sold to the general public. They are sometimes referred
to as “investment companies” or “registered investment companies.” Most
mutual funds are “open-ended,” meaning investors can buy or sell shares
of the fund at any time. Hedge funds are not considered a type of mutual
fund.
There is a three tier structure in the administration of mutual
fund companies, viz., sponsors, trustee and asset management companies
(AMCs). The trustee collects money from the investors and the AMCs
invest the same in the securities market. The investment decisions are
being taken by professionally qualified fund managers. The investments
are held in the form of units and the investors are called unit holders.
The returns from the investments are distributed to the unit holders after
deducting the expenses of AMCs. All the mutual funds are subject to the
SEBI guidelines. The following figure explains the operation of mutual
fund.
Figures showing the operation of mutual fund
One can make money from a mutual fund in three ways:
➢ ➢ 
Income is earned from dividends on stocks and interest on bonds.
A fund pays out nearly all of the income (90%) it receives over the
year to the unit holders in the form of a distribution.
348Notes
➢ ➢ 
If the fund sells securities that have increased in price, the fund has
a capital gain. Most funds also pass on these gains to investors in a
distribution.
➢ ➢ 
If fund holdings increase in price but are not sold by the fund
manager, the fund’s shares increase in price. One can then sell his/
her mutual fund shares for a profit.
Benefits of Investing in a Mutual Fund
➢ ➢ 
Small investments: With mutual fund investments, money can be
spread in small bits across varied companies. This way you reap the
benefits of a diversified portfolio with small investments.
➢ ➢ 
Professionally managed: The pool of money collected by a
mutual fund is managed by professionals who possess considerable
expertise, resources and experience. Through analysis of markets
and economy, they help pick favourable investment opportunities.
➢ ➢ 
Spreading risk: A mutual fund usually spreads the money in
companies across a wide spectrum of industries. This not only
diversifies the risk, but also helps take advantage of the position it
holds.
➢ ➢ 
Transparency and interactivity: Mutual funds clearly present their
investment strategy to their investors and regularly provide them
with information on the value of their investments. Also, a complete
portfolio disclosure of the investments made by various schemes
along with the proportion invested in each asset type is provided.
➢ ➢ 
Liquidity: Closed ended funds can be bought and sold at their
market value as they have their units listed at the stock exchange.
In addition to this, units can be directly redeemed to the mutual
fund as and when they announce the repurchase.
➢ ➢ 
Choice: A wide variety of schemes allow investors to pick up those
which suit their risk / return profile.
➢ ➢ 
Regulations: All the mutual funds are registered with SEBI. They
function within the provisions of strict regulation created to protect
the interests of the investor.
349Notes
Classification of Mutual Funds
Every investor has a different investment objective. Some go for
stability and opt for safer securities such as bonds or government securities.
Those who have a higher risk appetite and yearn for higher returns may
want to choose risk-bearing securities such as equities. Hence, mutual
funds come with different schemes, each with a different investment
objective. There are hundreds of mutual fund schemes to choose from.
Hence, they have been categorized as mentioned below.
➢ ➢ 
By structure: Closed-Ended, Open-Ended Funds, Interval funds.
➢ ➢ 
By nature: Equity, Debt, Balance or Hybrid.
➢ ➢ 
By investment objective: Growth Schemes, Income Schemes,
Balanced Schemes, Index funds.
a) Types of Mutual Funds by Structure
i) Close ended fund/scheme: A close ended fund or scheme has a
predetermined maturity period (eg. 5-7 years). The fund is open
for subscription during the launch of the scheme for a specified
period of time. Investors can invest in the scheme at the time
of the initial public issue and thereafter they can buy or sell the
units on the stock exchanges where they are listed. In order to
provide an exit route to the investors, some close ended funds give
an option of selling back the units to the mutual fund through
periodic repurchase at NAV related prices or they are listed in
secondary market.
ii) Open ended fund/scheme: The most common type of mutual fund
available for investment is an open-ended mutual fund. Investors
can choose to invest or transact in these schemes as per their
convenience. In an open-ended mutual fund, there is no limit to
the number of investors, shares, or overall size of the fund, unless
the fund manager decides to close the fund to new investors in
order to keep it manageable. The value or share price of an open-
ended mutual fund is determined at the market close every day
and is called the Net Asset Value (NAV).
iii) Interval schemes: Interval schemes combine the features of open-
ended and close-ended schemes. The units may be traded on the
350Notes
stock exchange or may be open for sale or redemption during
pre-determined intervals at NAV related prices. FMPs or Fixed
maturity plans are examples of these types of schemes.
b) Types of Mutual Funds by Nature
i) Equity mutual funds: These funds invest maximum part of their
corpus into equity holdings. The structure of the fund may vary
for different schemes and the fund manager’s outlook on different
stocks. The Equity funds are sub-classified depending upon their
investment objective such as Diversified equity funds, Mid-cap
funds, Small cap funds, Sector specific funds and Tax savings
funds (ELSS). Equity investments rank high on the risk-return grid
and hence, are ideal for a longer time frame.
ii) Debt mutual funds: These funds invest in debt instruments to
ensure low risk and provide a stable income to the investors.
Government authorities, private companies, banks and financial
institutions are some of the major issuers of debt papers. Debt
funds can be further classified into Gilt funds, Income funds,
MIPs, Short term plans and Liquid funds.
iii) Balanced funds: They invest in both equities and fixed income
securities which are in line with pre-defined investment objective
of the scheme. The equity portion provides growth while debt
provides stability in returns. This way, investors get to taste the
best of both worlds.
c) Types of Mutual Funds by Investment Objective
i) Growth schemes: Also known as equity schemes, these schemes
aim at providing capital appreciation over medium to long term.
These schemes normally invest a major portion of their fund in
equities and are willing to withstand short-term decline in value
for possible future appreciation.
ii) Income schemes: Also known as debt schemes, they generally
invest in fixed income securities such as bonds and corporate
debentures. These schemes aim at providing regular and steady
income to investors. However, capital appreciation in such schemes
may be limited.
351Notes
iii) Index schemes: These schemes attempt to reproduce the
performance of a particular index such as the BSE Sensex or the
NSE 50. Their portfolios will consist of only those stocks that
constitute the index. The percentage of each stock to the total
holding will be identical to the stocks index weight age. And hence,
the returns from such schemes would be more or less equivalent to
those of the Index.
Indian Fiscal System
Fiscal system of a country refers to the revenue and capital resources
that can be raised by government, the procedure to be observed in raising
and spending funds and in case of a federation such as ours the provision
that governs the relationship of the constituent unit of federation. It
includes within its purview taxation, expenditure, debt management
and inter-governmental fiscal relation. Indian fiscal system is based on
the constitution of India which is federal in character. The constitution
envisages two layers of government: the Union of central government and
the state government. Local bodies do not find a place in the constitution
and the function and resources allotted to them are delegated by the state
government.
Division and Functions
The constitution distributes the legislative function and resources
into three lists:
➢ ➢ 
The Union list (defence, foreign relation, railway, currency)
➢ ➢ 
The state list (education, medical public health, police, law & order)
➢ ➢ 
The concurrent list (trade union, planning & price policy)
The taxes over which there is legislative jurisdiction of centre
extends fall under four groups:
➢ ➢ 
Group I: The taxes which are levied and collected by the union and
the proceeds are retained by it. These are corporation tax, custom
duties, and taxes on capital value of asset of individual.
352Notes
➢ ➢ 
Group II: The taxes levied and collected by the union but the
proceeds of which are shared with the states. These are Income tax
and excise duties.
➢ ➢ 
Group III: The taxes which are levied and collected by the union
and the proceeds are assigned to states with in which they are levied.
These are succession and estate duties in respect to property other
then agriculture land, taxes on goods and passenger carried railway,
sea and air.
➢ ➢ 
Group IV: The taxes which are levied by the union but the proceeds
are of which are collected and retained by state. These are stamp
duties and duties on excise on medicine and toilet preparation
containing alcohol.
Expenditure of Government
The total expenditure consists of revenue expenditure (83%)
and capital expenditure (27%). Revenue expenditure is administrative
expenditure, and capital expenditure is spent towards capital or asset
formation. The total expenditure may also be classified into plan (26%)
and non-plan expenditure (74%).
Non Plan expenditure include Interest payment, Defense
expenditure, Subsidies, Grant to state and UT government, Grant to
foreign government and Other non plan expenditure
Expenditure of Central Government include General Service,
Organ of state, Tax collection, Police + Pension, Write off loan, Others
Social Service, Education, Sports & Youth affairs, Health and family
welfare, Water supply, Housing, Information and broadcasting, Labour
and employment, Welfare of ST,SC & OBC, Others Economic Services,
Agriculture & Allied activities, Rural development, Irrigation and flood
control, Energy, Industry & minerals, Transport, Communication, Science
Technology & Environment and Postal Services Loan, and Advances.
Receipt of Central Government
Receipt of Central Government includes tax revenue, non-tax
revenue and capital receipts.
353Notes
Tax revenue include Corporation tax, Tax on income on other then
Corporation Tax, Interest tax, Expenditure Tax, Custom Duty, Union Ex-
cise Duties, Wealth Tax, Gift Tax, Other Tax, Taxes on UT, and Service Tax.
Non-tax revenue include Fiscal Service, Interest Receipt, Dividend
and profit, Other general service, Social service, Economic Service, UT
without Legislature, and Grant–in–aid & contribution.
Capital Receipts include receipts from International debt Market,
External assistance, Recovery of Loan, Small saving, State provident fund,
Special deposit, Disinvestment and Others.
Deficits
a) Budget Deficit: Budget Deficit = Total Expenditure – Total
Revenue (The excess of revenue expenditure over revenue receipts.
It shows the deficit of government on current account).
Revenue Deficit = Revenue Expenditure – Revenue Receipts. (The
excess of all expenditure over all types of receipts including borrowings).
b) Fiscal Deficit: Fiscal Deficit = Revenue Deficit + Capital
expenditure (The excess of expenditure over revenue receipts
and non debt capital receipts. It represents the total borrowing
requirement of the central government).
Primary Deficit = Gross Fiscal deficit – Interest Payments (Fiscal
deficit net of interest payments. It is the non interest deficit and reflects
the current fiscal of the government).
Monetised Deficit: The part of fiscal deficit which is financed by
RBI through printing of notes.
Impact of Fiscal Deficit on the Economy
➢ ➢ 
The fiscal deficit measures the shortfall in government ability to
fund its expenditure through regular sources. Sources of funds for
a government are of kind- revenue and capital.
354Notes
➢ ➢ 
Fiscal Deficit is important to annual budget. The budget is the
government annual report, which differs from corporate annual
report in one key area-a budget gives projection or next year’s
number alongside its performance for a finished year.
➢ ➢ 
Fiscal Deficit represents the extent to which the government needs
fund, but does not have them. Government of India is the largest
borrower in India. Annual borrowings of Government are probably
larger than that of entire corporate sector.
➢ ➢ 
Besides, borrowing the government has another way of finding
funds it does not have. Being the law maker of the land gives the
government the power to create money which is simply printing
additional notes. This is called monetization.
➢ ➢ 
Fiscal Deficit to some extent is fine. One typically looks at ratio
of FD to gross domestic product. This ratio should ideally remain
around 4% for a country like India, says the IMF. A much higher
number is bad news. The government has large role to play in the
economy in areas like infrastructure, education, social support
(India does not have this), defence, civil administration, and so on.
Government needs are likely to more than its income in a growing
economy.
➢ ➢ 
Fiscal Deficit has a lot of impact on government policy. For example,
if it turns out to be very high in a year, the government will have to
either borrow a lot or print a lot of money. Borrowing a lot will push
up interest rate there by making the economy costlier and reducing
competitiveness of goods produced vis-à-vis those made by other
country. Printing lots of money breeds inflation, which is also bad
beyond a point.
➢ ➢ 
Sustained high deficits can lead to very high accumulation of debt
by the government leading to what is called internal debt trap.
➢ ➢ 
Fiscal Deficit can be kept within a limit either through increasing
revenue or cutting expenses or both. Revenue can be increased in
three fashions - increase tax rate or tax more things or reduce tax
evasion. In cutting expenses Government of India has traditionally
taken easier route, like cutting infrastructure spending instead
harder ones like cutting subsidies or freezing recruitment.

CASE STUDY
Failed IPO shows that manipulators have withdrawn from the game
Vaswani Industries Ltd's Initial Public Offering (IPO) was closed
for subscription on 3rd May and share allotment details were published
on 12th May 2011. After the allotment was published on the registrar's
website, retail investors were upset to see that they had received many
more shares than what had been allocated. Even though the issue was
subscribed 6.83 times in the retail category, investors got share allotment
of equivalent to 1.28 times over-subscription in this category. SEBI started
its investigation after getting complaints from high net-worth individuals
and retail investors.
The market regulator has collected bidding data from the registrar
to the issue (Link in time) and has written to the two exchanges - NSE
and BSE- to stop listing of the stock till it completes the investigations
into the bidding and the subsequent withdrawal of applications. How did
this happen?.The game starts when greedy promoters shop for investment
bankers who would promise the highest IPO price for their shares.
Invariably, the issues get a poor retail response and in the first couple of
days after an IPO opens for subscription, panic sets in.
The investment bankers then helpfully bring in financiers who
demand a 30% to 50% discount to put in applications. These financiers
also have the capability of making 4,000 to 5,000 retail applications if
required. Yes, the multiple applications scam is thriving, but has only got
more sophisticated to evade detection. Our sources say that investment
bankers are an integral part of this racket. Another aspect of the scam is
pure extortion. Here, some unscrupulous financiers prey on IPOs that get
a poor response on opening.
They then put in large applications to corner the retail quota. On
issue-closing day, they call the company and its investment bankers and
threaten to withdraw their application unless they are given a cash payoff.
With little time to rustle up genuine applications, a couple of promoters
have succumbed to the blackmail. In either case, with a block of thinly-
traded stock in their control, the price manipulators/financiers get to work
357Notes
once the stock gets listed. They rig the shares up and down, liquidate their
entire stake and walk out. With the market in doldrums, the manipulators
and financiers have withdrawn from the game. That's why the issue has
failed miserably.
Question
1. Discusses the various irregularities happened in the Vaswani IPO to
inflate demand and mislead Retail Individual Investors (RIIs) and

UNIT - V
You know that India is an emerging economy and going to be the
global power house. In the process of development, India is developing its
social and physical infrastructure. For these developments, more funds are
needed. Besides tapping its own debt market, now foreign capital is also
tapped for mobilizing funds in various ways. In this unit, let us understand
meaning of foreign investment, its various forms, modes and guidelines.

Lesson 5.2 - Foreign Institutional Investment
Lesson 5.3 - 
Offshore Country Funds, Foreign Venture Capital

national Capital Markets
Lesson 5.1 - Foreign Collaboration & Foreign Direct Investment
Learning Objectives
➢ ➢ To understand the meaning of Foreign Collaboration
➢ ➢ To understand the policy relating to Foreign Technology
Agreements.
➢ ➢ To understand the meaning of Foreign Direct Investment, its modes,
limits, Prohibited Sectors and investment in MSEs.
➢ ➢ To know about Foreign Currency Account and Escrow Account.
Foreign Collaboration
India’s investment policies are designed to attract significant capital
inflows into India on a sustained basis and to encourage technology
359Notes
collaborations between Indian and foreign entities. Foreign investment in
India is governed by sub-section (3) of Section 6 of the Foreign Exchange
Management Act, 1999 read with Notification No. FEMA 20/2000-
RB dated May 3, 2000, as amended from time to time. The regulatory
framework and instructions issued by the RBI have been compiled in the
Master Circular dated July 2, 2012 and that Master Circular is being issued
with a sunset clause of one year. That circular will stand withdrawn on
July 1, 2013 and be replaced by an updated Master Circular on the subject.
Types of Foreign Collaboration
There are two types of foreign collaborations:
a) Financial collaboration (foreign equity participation) where foreign
equity alone is involved:
b) Technical collaboration (technology transfer) involving licensing of
technology by the foreign collaborator on due compensation. -
There are two approving authorities
a) Reserve Bank of India, and
b) Department of Industrial Development in the Ministry of Industry,
Government of India.
Areas of Foreign Collaboration
The Government of India issues from time to time a list of industries
indicating where foreign investments may be permitted. The Government
of India (Foreign Investment Promotion Board) also considers import of
technology in Industries listed in Annexure A & Annexure B of Schedule
1 of Foreign Exchange Management (Transfer or issue of security by a
person resident outside India) Regulations, 2000 subject to compliance
with the provisions of the Industrial Policy and Procedures as notified by
Secretariat for Industrial Assistance (SIA) in the Ministry of Commerce
and Industry, Govt. of India, from time to time
360Notes
Technical Collaboration
The Industrial Policy, 1991, also provides that equity collaboration
need not necessarily be accompanied with technical collaborations. The
salient features of the Policy relating to Foreign Technology Agreements
are outlined below:
A) Standard Conditions Attached to Approvals for Foreign Investment
& Technology Agreements
1) The total non-resident shareholding in the undertaking should not
exceed the percentage(s) specified in the approval letter.
2) (a) The royalty will be calculated on the basis of the net ex-factory
sales price of the product, exclusive of excise duties, minus the
cost of the standard bought-out components and the landed
cost of imported components, irrespective of the source of
procurement, including ocean freight, insurance, customs
duties, etc. The payment of royalty will be restricted to the
licensed capacity plus 25% in excess thereof for such items
requiring industrial licence or on such capacity as specified in
the approval letter. This restriction will not apply to items not
requiring industrial licence. In case of production in excess of
this quantum, prior approval of Government would have to be
obtained regarding the terms of payment of royalty in respect
of such excess production.
(b) The royalty would not be payable beyond the period of the
agreement if the orders had not been executed during the period
of agreement. However, where the orders themselves took a long
time to execute or were executed after the period of agreement,
then in such cases the royalty for an order booked during the
period of agreement would be payable only after a Chartered
Accountant certifies that the orders in fact were firmly booked
and execution began during the period of agreement and the
technical assistance was available on a continuing basis even
after the period of agreement.
(c) No minimum guaranteed royalty would be allowed.
361Notes
3) The lump sum shall be paid in three instalments as detailed below,
unless otherwise stipulated in the approval letter:-
i) First 1/3rd after the approval for collaboration proposal
is obtained from Reserve Bank of India and collaboration
agreement is filed with the Authorized Dealer in Foreign
Exchange.
ii) Second 1/3rd on delivery of know-how documentation.
iii) Third and final 1/3rd on commencement of commercial
production, or four years after the proposal is approved
by Reserve Bank of India and agreement is filed with the
Authorized Dealer in Foreign Exchange, whichever is earlier.
The lump sum can be paid in more than three instalments,
subject to completion of the activities as specified above.
4) All remittances to the foreign collaborator shall be made as per the
exchange rates prevailing on the date of remittance.
5) The applications for remittances may be made to the Authorized
Dealer in Form A2 with the undernoted documents:-
i) A No Objection certificate issued by the Income-tax authorities
in the standard form or a copy of the certificate issued by the
designated bank regarding the payment of tax where the tax
has been paid at a flat rate of 30% to the designated bank.
ii) A certificate from the Chartered Accountant in Form TCK/
TCR (depending upon the purpose of payment).
iii) A declaration by the applicant to the effect that the proposed
remittance is strictly in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the collaboration approved by RBI/Government.
6) The agreement shall be subject to Indian Laws.
7) A copy of the foreign investment and technology transfer agreement
signed by both the parties may be furnished to the following
authorities:-
i) Administrative Ministry/Department.
ii) Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, New Delhi.
iii) Concerned Regional Officer of Exchange Control Department,
RBI.
362Notes
iv) Authorized Dealer designated to service the agreement.
8) All payments under the foreign investment and technology transfer
agreement including rupee payments (if any) to be made in connec-
tion with the engagement/deputation of foreign technical person-
nel such as passage fare, living expenses, etc. of foreign technicians,
would be liable for the levy of cess under the Research and Devel-

Approval of Collaboration Proposals
Approval for Foreign Collaboration / Joint Venture
At present in India most of the Foreign Collaboration or Joint
Venture does not require any approval prior approval from Government
of India. However any Joint Venture or Foreign Collaboration where the
Foreign Equity Participation exceeds the prescribed limit allowed for
automatic route would require prior approval as per the provisions of
FEMA and Government Investment Policy.
Approval for Foreign Technology Agreements
The Government now provides for automatic approval most of the
technology agreements as subject to FEMA. Applications for automatic
approval must be made to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and must
clearly state the description of the goods to be manufactured in the Indian
Trade Classification System. After RBI approval, the entrepreneurs may
approach authorized dealers for foreign exchange release along with
a copy of the technology agreement. All other proposals must comply
with general procedures in force. In order to give Indian industries more
freedom in negotiating foreign technology agreements, the government no
longer requires the companies to obtain approval for the hiring of foreign
technicians and foreign testing of indigenously developed technologies.

10,2012 is available in public domain and can be downloaded from the
website of Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Department of Industrial
Policy and Promotion governed by the provisions of the Foreign Exchange
Management Act (FEMA), 1999. FEMA Regulations which prescribe
amongst other things the mode of investments i.e., issue or acquisition of
shares / convertible debentures and preference shares, manner of receipt of
funds, pricing guidelines and reporting of the investments to the Reserve
Bank. The Reserve Bank has issued Notification No. FEMA 20 /2000-RB
dated May 3, 2000 which contains the Regulations in this regard. This
Notification has been amended from time to time. The following figure

Introduction
The Foreign Institutional Investment (FII) is another mode through
which a country can tap foreign capital. This is the foreign investment
under portfolio investment Scheme. Portfolio debt flows result from
foreign investors buying domestic debt securities. A German investor
buying bonds in Canada is an example. Commercial bank lending (loans
from private financial institutions) is also portfolio debt. Portfolio equity
flows occur, similarly, when foreign investors purchase equity securities
domestically. A Japanese investor who purchases stock in the Brazilian
stock market is creating an equity capital flow into Brazil. ADRs and
GDRs also fit into this category. FII is a term commonly used in India
to refer to outside companies investing in the financial markets of India.
FIIs include institutions such as pension funds, mutual funds, investment
trusts, asset management companies or their power of attorney holders
(providing discretionary and non-discretionary portfolio management
services). The FIIs are invited to invest in all the securities traded in
the primary and secondary markets, including the equity and other
instruments of companies which are listed or are to be listed on the stock
exchanges in India. The FIIs are required to register with SEBI, which shall,
while granting registration to the FII, take into account its track record,
professional competence, financial soundness, experience, etc.

401Lesson 5.3 - Offshore Country Funds, Foreign Venture
Capital Investments, Other Foreign Investments &
International Capital Markets
Learning Objectives
➢ ➢ 
To understand the meaning and advantages of offshore country
funds.
➢ ➢ 
To understand the provisions relating to Foreign Venture Capital
Investments.
➢ ➢ 
To get an insight into the other forms of Foreign Investments
➢ ➢ 
To understand the phases in internationalization of capital markets.
Offshore Country Funds
An “offshore” investment vehicle is located in a different country
than the one where you live. There is another, more informal definition of
“offshore”: an investment entity that is located in a country that specializes in
hosting “offshore” entities. Some of the best-known examples are Bermuda,
the Cayman Islands, the Channel Islands, and Malta. Thus, An offshore
fund can be defined as a collective investment scheme domiciled in an
Offshore Financial Centre such as the British Virgin Islands, Luxembourg,
or the Cayman Islands; it is typically sold exclusively to ‘foreign’ investors
(those not of the domestic fund sponsor’s country of origin).
Thus, a common example could involve an offshore fund managed
or sponsored by a U.S.-based money manager, organized under the laws
of the Cayman Islands and sold exclusively to non-U.S. investors. For the
purposes of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 of the UK, an
offshore fund is one which is governed by the Offshore Fund Rules set
out in that Act. The vast majority of offshore funds are organized under
the laws of the Cayman Islands, with the British Virgin Islands being the
second most popular domicile.
402Advantages
Offshore funds offer eligible investors significant tax benefits
compared to many high tax jurisdictions. An offshore fund can be
managed similarly however without the high taxes otherwise involved with
a similarly managed U.S. organized fund. Where income is repatriated
(paid or transferred) to high tax jurisdictions, however, such income is
usually taxed at normal rates as foreign sourced or arising income. Many
of these tax-haven locations are considered investor-friendly and are
internationally regarded as financially secure. Many offshore jurisdictions,
notably the British Virgin Islands, offer a zero-tax regime for investment
funds which are domiciled there, which allows the fund to reinvest that
part of its investment portfolio’s gains which would otherwise have been
lost to tax. In addition, the regulatory regime in these offshore jurisdictions
is deliberately light, with emphasis placed on the importance of balancing
effective regulation for the benefit of the protection of investors on the
one hand, with the establishment of a regime in which the conduct of
investment business is fast and simple. A number of offshore jurisdictions
have recently tightened the regulation of offshore funds.
Investments by Foreign Venture Capital Investor
i) A SEBI registered Foreign Venture Capital Investor (FVCI) with
specific approval from the Reserve Bank can invest in Indian
Venture Capital Undertaking (IVCU) or Venture Capital Fund
(VCF) or in a scheme floated by such VCFs subject to the condition
that the domestic VCF is registered with SEBI. These investments
by SEBI registered FVCI, would be subject to the respective SEBI
regulations and FEMA regulations and sector specific caps of FDI.
ii) An IVCU is defined as a company incorporated in India whose
shares are not listed on a recognized stock exchange in India and
which is not engaged in an activity under the negative list specified
by SEBI. A VCF is defined as a fund established in the form of a
trust, a company including a body corporate and registered under
the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Venture Capital
Fund) Regulations, 1996 which has a dedicated pool of capital
raised in a manner specified under the said Regulations and which
invests in Venture Capital Undertakings in accordance with the
said Regulations.
403Notes
iii) FVCIs can purchase equity / equity linked instruments / debt /
debt instruments, debentures of an IVCU or of a VCF or in units
of schemes / funds set up by a VCF through initial public offer or
private placement or by way of private arrangement or purchase
from third party. Further, FVCIs would also be allowed to invest in
securities on a recognized stock exchange subject to the provisions
of the SEBI (FVCI) Regulations, 2000, as amended from time to
time. At the time of granting approval, the Reserve Bank permits
the FVCI to open a non-interest bearing Foreign Currency
Account and/or a non-interest bearing Special Non-Resident
Rupee Account with a designated branch of an AD Category – I
bank, subject to certain terms and conditions.
iv) A SEBI registered FVCI can acquire / sale securities (as given in (i
ii) above) by way of public offer or private placement by the issuer
of such securities and /or by way of private arrangement with a
third party at a price that is mutually acceptable to the buyer and
the seller.
v)
AD Category–I banks can offer forward cover to FVCIs to the
extent of total inward remittance. In case the FVCI has made any
remittance by liquidating some investments, original cost of the
investments has to be deducted from the eligible cover to arrive at
the actual cover that can be offered.

411Notes
International Capital Markets
A capital market is basically a market where long term funds are
borrowed and lent. International capital market is a market in which
governments, companies, and people borrow and invest across national
boundaries. In addition to the benefits and purposes of a domestic capital
market, international capital markets provide the following benefits:
a) Higher returns and cheaper borrowing costs. These allow
companies and governments to tap into foreign markets and access
new sources of funds. Many domestic markets are too small or
too costly for companies to borrow in. By using the international
capital markets, companies, governments, and even individuals can
borrow or invest in other countries for either higher rates of return
or lower borrowing costs.
b) Diversifying risk. The international capital markets allow
individuals, companies, and governments to access more
opportunities in different countries to borrow or invest, which in
turn reduces risk. The theory is that not all markets will experience
contractions at the same time.
Components of International Capital Markets
The structure of the international capital markets falls into two
components—primary and secondary. The primary market is where
new securities (stocks and bonds are the most common) are issued. If a
corporation or government agency needs funds, it issues (sells) securities
to purchasers in the primary market. Big investment banks assist in this
issuing process as intermediaries. The vast majority of capital transactions
take place in the secondary market. The secondary market includes stock
exchanges (the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange,
and the Tokyo Nikkei), bond markets, and futures and options markets,
among others. The important components of international capital markets
include:
i)
International Equity Markets: Companies sell their stock in the
equity markets. International equity market consists of all the stock
traded outside the issuing company’s home country. Many large
global companies seek to take advantage of the global financial
412Notes
centers and issue stock in major markets to support local and
regional operations. For example, Arcelor Mittal is a global steel
company headquartered in Luxembourg; it is listed on the stock
exchanges of New York, Amsterdam, Paris, Brussels, Luxembourg,
Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao, and Valencia. While the daily value of
the global markets changes, in the past decade the international
equity markets have expanded considerably, offering global firms
increased options for financing their global operations. The key
factors for the increased growth in the international equity markets
are the following:
➢ ➢ 
Growth of developing markets: As developing countries
experience growth, their domestic firms seek to expand
into global markets and take advantage of cheaper and more
flexible financial markets.
➢ ➢ 
Drive to privatize: In the past two decades, the general trend
in developing and emerging markets has been to privatize
formerly state-owned enterprises. These entities tend to be
large, and when they sell some or all of their shares, it infuses
billions of dollars of new equity into local and global markets.
Domestic and global investors, eager to participate in the
growth of the local economy, buy these shares.
➢ ➢ 
Investment banks: With the increased opportunities in
new emerging markets and the need to simply expand their
own businesses, investment banks often lead the way in the
expansion of global equity markets. These specialized banks
seek to be retained by large companies in developing countries
or the governments pursuing privatization to issue and sell the
stocks to investors with deep pockets outside the local country.
➢ ➢ 
Technology advancements: The expansion of technology into
global finance has opened new opportunities to investors and
companies around the world. Technology and the Internet
have provided more efficient and cheaper means of trading
stocks and, in some cases, issuing shares by smaller companies.
b) International Bond Markets: Bonds are the most common form of
debt instrument, which is basically a loan from the holder to the
issuer of the bond. The international bond market consists of all the
413Notes
bonds sold by an issuing company, government, or entity outside
their home country. Companies might access the international
bond markets for a variety of reasons, including funding a new
production facility or expanding its operations in one or more
countries. There are several types of international bonds.
i)
Foreign Bond: A foreign bond is a bond sold by a company,
government, or entity in another country and issued in the
currency of the country in which it is being sold. There are foreign
exchange, economic, and political risks associated with foreign
bonds, and many sophisticated buyers and issuers of these bonds
use complex hedging strategies to reduce the risks. For example,
the bonds issued by global companies in Japan denominated in
yen are called samurai bonds. As you might expect, there are
other names for similar bond structures. Foreign bonds sold in
the United States and denominated in US dollars are called Yankee
bonds. In the United Kingdom, these foreign bonds are called
bulldog bonds. Foreign bonds issued and traded throughout
Asia except Japan, are called dragon bonds, which are typically
denominated in US dollars. Foreign bonds are typically subject to
the same rules and guidelines as domestic bonds in the country
in which they are issued. There are also regulatory and reporting
requirements, which make them a slightly more expensive bond
than the Eurobond. The requirements add small costs that can add
up given the size of the bond issues by many companies.
ii)
Eurobond: A Eurobond is a bond issued outside the country in
whose currency it is denominated. Eurobonds are not regulated
by the governments of the countries in which they are sold, and
as a result, Eurobonds are the most popular form of international
bond. A bond issued by a Japanese company, denominated in US
dollars, and sold only in the United Kingdom and France is an
example of a Eurobond.
iii) Global Bond: A global bond is a bond that is sold simultaneously in
several global financial centers. It is denominated in one currency,
usually US dollars or Euros. By offering the bond in several
markets at the same time, the company can reduce its issuing costs.
This option is usually reserved for higher rated, creditworthy, and
typically very large firms.
414Notes
Phases in the Internationalization of Capital Markets
One of the most important developments since the 1970s has been
the internationalization, and now globalization, of capital markets. The
phases in the internationalization of capital markets include the following:
1) The International Capital Market of the Late 1990s was Composed
of a Number of Closely Integrated Markets with an International
Dimension
Basically, the international capital market includes any transaction
with an international dimension. It is not really a single market but a number
of closely integrated markets that include some type of international
component. The foreign exchange market was a very important part of the
international capital market during the late 1990s. Internationally traded
stocks and bonds have also been part of the international capital market.
Since the late 1990s, sophisticated communications systems have allowed
people all over the world to conduct business from wherever they are.
The major world financial centers include Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo,
London, New York, and Paris, among others.
2. The Need to Reduce Risk Through Portfolio Diversification Explains
in Part the Importance of the International Capital Market During
the Late 1990s
A major benefit of the internationalization of capital markets is
the diversification of risk. Individual investors, major corporations, and
individual countries all usually try to diversify the risks of their financial
portfolios. The reason is that people are generally risk-averse. They would
rather get returns on investments that are in a relatively narrow band
than investments that have wild fluctuations year-to-year. All portfolio
investors look at the risk of their portfolios versus their returns. Higher
risk investments generally have the potential to yield higher returns, but
there is much more variability. Portfolio diversification looks at the risk
versus the return available to get the highest return possible at the lowest
possible risk. When an investor or a company invests in many different
assets (stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc.), risk is reduced because there
is less reliance on any single asset. By using world markets, risk can be
reduced even more.
415Notes
3. The Principal Actors in the International Capital Markets of the Late
1990s were Banks, Non-Bank Financial Institutions, Corporations,
and Government Agencies
Commercial banks powered their way to a place of considerable
influence in international markets during the late 1990s. The primary
reason for this was that they often pursued international activities that
they would not have been able to undertake in their home countries.
Commercial banks undertook a broad array of financial activities during
the late 1990s. Non-bank financial institutions became another fast-rising
force in international markets during the late 1990s. Insurance companies,
pension and trust funds, and mutual funds from many countries began
to diversify into international markets in the 1990s. Together, portfolio
enhancement and a widespread increase in fund contributors have
accounted for the strength these funds had in the international marketplace.
4. Changes in the International Marketplace Resulted in a New Era of
Global Capital Markets During the Late 1990s, which were Critical to
Development
First, citizens around the world (and especially the Japanese) began
to increase their personal savings. Second, many governments further
deregulated their capital markets since 1980. This allowed domestic
companies more opportunities abroad, and foreign companies had the
opportunity to invest in the deregulated countries. Finally, technological
advances made it easier to access global markets. Information could be
retrieved quicker, easier, and cheaper than ever before. This allowed
investors in one country to obtain more detailed information about
investments in other countries, and obtain it quite efficiently. So, in the
late 1990s we witnessed the globalization of markets - i.e., the increased
integration of domestic markets into a global economy. This differed
from the process of internationalization, which connected less integrated
domestic markets of the past with offshore markets. The global capital
markets became critical to development in an open economy.

There are two sources of capital: private sources and public sources.
Both sources are very important to the economies of the world. Capital

flows result when funds are transferred across borders; the flows are
recorded in the balance of payments account.
a) Private Sources of Capital: Foreign direct investment and portfolio
investment (both debt and equity flows) are important sources of
private capital. They are already explained in the earlier lessons.
b) Public Sources of Capital: Public sources of capital include official
non-concessional loans of both multilateral and bilateral aid and
official development assistance (ODA). ODA is made up of grants
and concessional multilateral and bilateral loans.
➢ ➢ 
Official non-concessional loans: multilateral & bilateral aid:
Official non-concessional multilateral aid consists of loans
from the World Bank, regional development banks, and other
intergovernmental agencies such as multilateral organizations.
The term “non-concessional” refers to the fact that these loans
are based on market rates, must be repaid, and are not partly
grants. By contrast, official non-concessional bilateral aid
is loans from governments and their central banks or other
agencies. Export credit agency loans are also included here.
“Bilateral” refers to the fact that the entities providing the
funding provide aid only in their home country.
➢ ➢ 
ODA: official grants and concessional loans: ODA refers
in part to official public grants that are legally binding
commitments and provide a specific amount of capital available
to disburse for which no repayment is required. Concessional
bilateral aid refers to aid from governments, central banks, and
export credit agencies that contains a partial grant element (25%
or more), or partially forgives the loan. Similarly, concessional
multilateral aid contains a partial grant, or forgiveness of the
loan. Multilateral aid comes from the World Bank, regional
development banks and intergovernmental agencies.
c) Private Capital Became Very Important to Development in
the Late 1990s: During the 1990s, the sources of capital for
developing countries changed drastically. Private funding, however,
skyrocketed. Clearly, there was a fundamental change in the
sources of funds for developing countries to draw from during the
late 1990s. Why did this major change occur? As stated previously,
417Notes
international portfolio diversification became more prevalent
every day. Insurance companies, mutual funds, pension funds, and
securities houses were looking to diversify. They also had more
funds than ever to invest. Worldwide, portfolios were absorbing an
increasing share of aggregate savings. These portfolios were coming
more and more under the control of professional fund managers.
As overall international portfolio diversification grew, so too did
the share of international portfolio diversification that went to developing
countries. Capital flows to developing countries acted as catalysts,
propelling the world closer to a seamless global marketplace during the late
1990s. The growth of global institutional investors resulted in capital flows
to emerging markets based more on short-term liquidity and performance
than long-term business ventures. To protect themselves from the risks of
these volatile cash flows, developing countries can take some precautionary
measures. The central bank can intervene in foreign exchange markets and
capital controls can be imposed.
Conclusion
India has been able to provide an enabling environment to foreign
investors in several respects. Deep reforms in capital markets aided by
an efficient regulatory architecture have facilitated portfolio investments.
Transfer and acquisition of shares are taking place according to investor-
friendly guidelines. Foreign exchange regulations have been aligned to
global standards through FEMA. In the near future, it is hoped that more
foreign capital would flow.

CASE STUDY
Clash of the titans: Overlapping and contradictory foreign
investment regulations in India
The SEBI and RBI have been working independently towards
rationalising the existing investment regime to make it more investor-
friendly. This shift in attitude is evident with the introduction by SEBI
of Qualified Foreign Investors (“QFIs”) as a new class of investors, the
promulgation of the SEBI (Alternative Investment Fund) Regulations,
2012 and permission granted by RBI to Foreign Venture Capital Investors
(FVCIs) to participate in secondary transactions. In addition, RBI has
allowed FVCIs to be active participants in stock exchanges which seems
to encroach on the monopoly of Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs)
regulated by SEBI.FVCIs were permitted invest in venture capital funds
and Indian venture capital undertakings, which are defined to mean
companies not listed on a recognised stock exchange and to invest up to a
third of their investible funds in preferential allotment by listed companies.
RBI’s circular dated 19 March 2012 extended this, allowing FVCIs to
invest in eligible securities by way of private arrangement, purchase from
a third party or by investing in securities on a recognised stock exchange.
Although the RBI Circular issued in this respect attempts to liberalise
investments made by FVCIs in India, it is subject to provisions of SEBI
Regulations, which currently don’t allow FVCIs to invest in the manner
permitted by RBI’s Circular.
The SEBI’s AIF Regulations, defines an Alternative Investment Fund
(AIF) to mean any fund established or incorporated in India which collects
funds from domestic and/or foreign investors for investing the funds in
accordance with a defined investment policy. However, the consolidated
Foreign Direct Investment Policy effective from 10 April 2012 does not
permit foreign investments in AIFs. While, the Department of Industrial
Policy and Promotion (DIPP) has in the last one year, issued clarifications
and made changes to the FDI Policy, none of the press notes issued till date
mention the possibility of foreign investments in AIFs. In addition to this,
the AIF Regulations created a category of AIFs that would be eligible for
tax benefits. However, the government has not announced any benefits or
conditions for funds to qualify as such AIFs so far. A similar disconnect is
seen in the regime for QFIs who were allowed to invest in the Indian equity
420and debt markets to boost foreign investment in the country. However,
this route hasn’t seen much success due to the skepticism surrounding the
tax risk for depositories whose clients are QFIs.
Question
1. What is the problem in this case? Give suggestions to solve the
problem.
