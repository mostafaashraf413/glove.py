CHAPTER  
Introduction 
Open a book   any book  on the economics of developing countries  and it will begin with 
the usual litany of woes  Developing countries  notwithstanding the enormous strides they 
have made in the last few decades  display fundamental economic inadequacies in a wide 
range of indicators  Levels of physical capital per person are small  Nutrition levels are low 
Other indicators of human capital such as education   both at the primary and seconday 
levels   are well below developed-country benchmarks  So are access to sanitation  safe 
water and housing  Population growth rates are high  and so are infant mortality rates  One 
could expand this list indefinitely 
Notice that some of these indicators   infant mortality or life expectancy  for instance  
may be regarded as defining features of underdevelopment  so in this respect the list above 
may be viewed  not as a statement of correlations  but as a definition of what we mean by 
development  or the lack of it  But other indicators  such as low quantities of physical capital 
per capita  or population growth rates  are at least one step removed  These features don t 
define underdevelopment  For instance  it is unclear whether low fertility rates are intrinsically 
a feature of economic welfare or development  Surely  many families in rich countries may 
take great pleasure in having a large number of offspring  Likewise  large holdings of 
physical capital may well have an instrumental value to play in the development process 
but surely the mere existence of such holdings does not constitute a defining characteristic 
of economic welfare 
And indeed  that is how it should be  We do not make a list of the features that go hand in 
hand with underdevelopment simply to define the term  We do so because   implictly 
or explicitly   we are looking for explanations  Why are underdeveloped countries 
underdeveloped 
It is easy enough to point to these inadequacies in terms of physical 
and human capital  but the extra step to branding these as causes of underdevelopment is 
perilously close  and we should avoid taking that step  Low levels of capital  or low levels 
of education  are just as much symptoms of development as causes  and to the extent that 
 Perhaps the word  underdeveloped  does not constitute politically correct usuage  so that several publications 
  those by well-known international organizations chief among them   use the somewhat more hopeful and 
placatory present continuous  developing  I won t be using such niceties in this article  because it should be 
clear   or at least it is clear in my mind   that economic underdevelopment pins no derogatory social label on 
those who live in  or come from  such societies 
  Introduction 
they intertwine with and accompany the development process  or the lack of it  we cannot 
rely on these observations as explanations 
That doesn t stop economists from offering such explanations  however  More than one 
influential study has regressed growth rates  alternatively  levels  of per-capita income on 
variables such as the rate of savings and population growth  There is very little doubt  in fact 
that such variables are significantly associated with per-capita income  But nevertheless 
we do have to think about the sense in which these studies serve as explanations for 
underdevelopment 
For instance  is it the case that individuals in different parts of the world have some intrinsic 
difference in their willingness   or ability   to save  or to procreate  If this were the case 
we could hang our hat on the following sort of theory  such-and-such country is populated 
by people who habitually save very little  This is why they are underdeveloped 
Somehow  this does not seem right  We would like to have a theory which   while not 
belittling or downplaying the role of social  cultural and political factors   does not simply 
stop there  We would like to know  for instance  whether low incomes provoke  in turn 
low savings rates so that we have a genuine chicken-and-egg problem  The same is true of 
demographics   underdevelopment might be a cause of high population growth rates  just 
as high population growth rates themselves retard the development process 
My goal in these notes is to talk about some of these chicken-and-egg situations  in which 
underdevelopment is seen not as a failure of some fundamental economic parameters 
or socio-cultural values  but as an interacting  equilibrium  that hangs together  perhaps 
precipitated by inertia or by history   Indeed  in what follows  I will make a conceptual 
distinction between equilibria created by inertia and those created by history 
Why is this view of the development process an important one  There are three reasons 
why I feel this view should be examined very seriously 
  This point of view leads to a theory  or a set of theories  in which economic  convergence 
 of incomes  wealth  levels of well-being  across countries is not to be automatically had 
Actually  the intelligent layperson reading these words will find this reasoning a bit abstruse 
why on earth would one expect convergence in the first place  And why  indeed  should I 
find a theory interesting on the grounds that it does not predict convergence  when I knew 
that all along  This is not a bad line of reasoning  but to appreciate why it is misguided  it is 
important to refer to a venerable tradition in economics that has convergence as its very core 
prediction  The idea is based   roughly   on the argument that countries which are poor 
will have higher marginal products of capital  and consequently a higher rate of return to 
capital  This means that a dollar of extra savings will have a higher payoff in poor countries 
allowing it grow faster  The prediction  pooere countries will tend to grow faster  so that 
over time rich and poor countries will come together  or  converge 
This is not the place to examine the convergence hypothesis in detail  as my intention is 
to cover other views of development  But one should notice that convergence theories 
in this raw form have rarely been found acceptable  though rarely does not mean never 
 
See Ray   Chapters   and  
Introduction  
among some economists  and there are several subtle variants of the theory  Some of 
these variants still preserve the idea that lots of  other things  being equal  convergence 
in some conditional sense is still to be had  It s only if we start accepting the possibility 
that   perhaps   these  other things  cannot be kept equal  that the notion of conditional 
convergence starts losing its relevance and very different views of development  not at all 
based on the idea of convergence  must be sought 
  The second reason why I find these theories important is that they do not reply on 
 fundamental  differences across peoples or cultures  Thus we may worry about whether 
Confucianism is better than the Protestant ethic in promoting hard-headed  succesful 
economic agents  and we might certainly decry Hindu fatalism as deeply inimical to 
purposeful  economic self-advancement  but we have seen again and again that when it 
comes down to the economic crunch and circumstances are right  both Confucian and 
Hindu will make the best of available opportunities   and so will the Catholics and a host 
of other relgions and cultures besides  Once again  this is not the place to examine in detail 
fundamentalist explanations based on cultural or religious differences  but I simply don t 
find them very convincing  This is not to say that culture   like conditional convergence 
  does not play a role   In fact  I provide such examples below  But I also take the view 
that culture  along with several other economic  social and political institutions  are all part 
of some broader interactive theory in which  first cause  is to be found   if at all   in 
historical accident 
  The last reason why I wish to focus on these theories is that create a very different role for 
government policy  Specifically  I will argue that these theories place a much greater weight 
on one-time  or temporary  interventions than theories that are based on fundamentals  For 
instance  if it is truly Hindu fatalism that keeps Indian savings rates low  then a policy of 
encouraging savings  say  through tax breaks  will certainly have an effect on growth rates 
But there is no telling when that policy can be taken away  or indeed  if it can be taken away 
at all  For in the absence of the policy  the theory would tell us that savings would revert 
to the old Hindu level  In contrast  a theory that is based on an interactive chicken-and-egg 
approach would promote a policy that attempts to push the chicken-egg cycle into a new 
equilibrium  Once that happens  the policy can be removed  This is not to say that once-andfor-all 
policies are the correct ones  but only to appreciate that the interactive theories I am 
going to talk about have very different implications from the traditional ones 
 
CHAPTER  
The Calibration Game 
The simple model of convergence also has to be put through enormous contortions to fit the 
most essential development facts regarding per-capita income across countries  This is the 
point of the current section 
  Some Basic Facts 
Low per capita incomes are an important feature of economic underdevelopment perhaps 
the most important feature and there is little doubt that the distribution of income across 
the world s nations is extraordinarily skewed 
The World Development Report  see  e g  World Bank   contains estimates for all 
countries  converted to a common currency  By this yardstick  the world produced 
approximately   trillion of output in   A little less than   trillion of this   less 
than     came from low- and middle-income developing countries  around   of the 
world s population  Switzerland  one of the world s richest countries  enjoyed a per capita 
income close to   times that of Ethiopia  one of the world s poorest 
A serious discrepancy arises from the fact that prices for many goods in all countries are not 
appropriately reflected in exchange rates  This is only natural for goods and services that are 
not internationally traded  The International Comparison Program publishes PPP estimates 
of income  and under these the differences are still huge  but no longer of the order of  
Over the period   the richest   of the world s nations averaged a per capita 
income  PPP  that was about twenty-nine times the corresponding figure for the poorest 
  As Parente and Prescott   quite correctly observed  interstate disparities within the 
United States do not even come close to these international figures  In   the richest state 
in the United States was Connecticut and the poorest was Mississippi  and the ratio of per 
capita incomes worked out to slightly less than  
Of course  the fact that the richest   of countries bear approximately the same ratio of 
incomes  relative to the poorest   does not suggest that the entire world distribution 
of incomes has remained stationary  Of greatest interest   a recent financial crisis 
notwithstanding   is the meteoric rise of the East Asian economies  Japan  Korea  Taiwan 
  The Calibration Game 
Singapore  Hong Kong  Thailand  Malaysia  Indonesia  and  commencing somewhat later 
China  Over the period   the per capita incomes of the aforementioned eight East 
Asian economies  excluding China  increased at an annual rate of   Over  
the pace slowed somewhat  especially in Japan  but averaged well over   per year for the 
remainder 
Impressive as these rates are  they are dwarfed by China s phenomenal performance 
Between   and   China s per capita income grew at an annual rate of   The 
corresponding figure for the  s is even higher  around  
In contrast  much of Latin America languished during the  s  After relatively high rates 
of economic expansion in the two preceding decades  growth slowed to a crawl  and in many 
cases there was no growth at all  Morley s   study observed that in Latin America  per 
capita income fell by   during the  s  and only Chile and Colombia had a significantly 
higher per capita income in   than they did in   It is certainly true that such figures 
should be treated cautiously  given the extreme problems of accurate GNP measurement in 
high-inflation countries  but they illustrate the situation well enough  With some notable 
exceptions  such as Chile    and Argentina    annual per-capita growth in incomes 
continues to be extremely slow for Latin America in the  s  though these rates did turn 
positive through most of the region 
Similarly  much of Africa stagnated or declined over the  s  Countries such as Nigeria 
and Tanzania experienced substantial declines of per capita income  whereas countries such 
as Kenya and Uganda barely grew in per capita terms  Notable turnarounds in the  s 
have occurred in both directions  with alarming declines in countries such as the Congo 
Rwanda and Burundi  and substantial progress in Uganda 
Looking at the overall picture once more without naming countries  one can get a good 
sense of the world income distribution by looking at mobility matrices  an idea first applied 
to countries by Danny Quah  I ve constructed one such matrix using   countries over the 
period   see Figure  
Each row and column in this matrix is per-capita income relative to world per-capita income 
The rows represent these ratios in   the columns the corresponding ratios in   The 
cell entries represent percentages of countries in each row-column combination  the rows 
adding up to   each  So  for instance    of the countries that earned less than than a 
quarter of world per-capita income in   continued to do just that in  
Clearly  while there is no evidence that very poor countries are doomed to eternal poverty 
there is some indication that both very low and very high incomes are extremely sticky 
Middle-income countries have far greater mobility than either the poorest or the richest 
countries  For instance  countries in category    between half the world average and the 
world average  in   moved away to  right  and  left  less than half of them remained 
where they were in   In stark contrast to this  fully   of the poorest countries 
 category   in   remained where they were  and none of them went above the world 
average by   Likewise  another   of the richest countries in   stayed right where 
 To appreciate how high these rates of growth really are  note that for the entire data set of   countries studied 
by Parente and Prescott  per capita growth averaged   per year over the period

Figure   The Income Mobility of Countries   
they were  This is interesting because it suggests that although everything is possible  in 
principle  a history of underdevelopment or extreme poverty puts countries at a tremendous 
disadvantage 
There is actually a bit more to Figure   than lack of mobility at the extremes  Look at the 
next-to-poorest category  those with incomes between one-quarter and one-half of the world 
  The Calibration Game 
average in   Almost half of them dropped to an even lower category  Thus it is not only 
the lowest-income countries that might be caught in a very difficult situation  In general  at 
low levels of income  the overall tendency seems to be movement in the downward direction 
My book contains a corresponding mobility matrix for   with very similar findings 
To summarize  then  we have the following observations 
  Over the period   the relative distribution of world income appears to have been 
quite stable  The richest   of the world s nations averaged a level of per capita income 
that was about   times the corresponding figure for the poorest   By any standards 
this disparity is staggering  and especially so when we remember that we are talking about 
incomes that have been corrected for purchasing power parity 
  The fact that the overall distribution has remained stationary does not mean that there 
has been little movement of countries within the world distribution  Of particular interest 
in the  s is the rise of the East Asian economies and the languishing of other economies 
particularly those of sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America  Diverse growth experiences 
such as these can change the economic composition of the world in the space of a few 
decades  Nonetheless  a single explanation for this diversity remains elusive 
  The observation that several countries have changed relative positions suggests that there 
are no ultimate traps to development  At the same time  a history of wealth or poverty does 
seem to partly foretell future developments  The mobility of countries appears to be highest 
somewhere in the middle of the wealth distribution  whereas a history of underdevelopment 
or extreme poverty appears to put countries at a disadvantage 
  That history matters in this way is an observation that requires a careful explanation 
Poor countries do seem to have some advantages  They can use  relatively free of charge 
technologies that are developed by their richer counterparts  Scarce capital in these countries 
should display a higher rate of profit  because of the law of diminishing returns  They can 
learn from mistakes that their predecessors have made  In this way differences across 
countries should iron themselves out over the longer run  Thus the observation that history 
matters in maintaining persistent differences needs more of a justification than might be 
obvious at first glance 
One can see different attempts to reconcile the failure of convergence with the traditional 
theory 
 A  Hardline View  Don t abandon the traditional aggregative theory but seek reasons for 
productivity and other controls to be systematically different across countries  Conditional 
on those controls  attempt to establish convergence 
 B  Multiplicity View  Abandon the convergence argument  Argue that the same fundamentals 
can progress in very different directions depending on initial conditions 
 C  Interactive View  Argue that the world is one interactive system and cannot be split up 
into several growth models  with or without convergence  running side by side 
In these notes we shall spend some time with each of these views 
The Calibration Game  
  The Parente-Prescott and Lucas Calibrations 
Normalize labor to   and consider the following aggregative production function 
yt   Atk 
 
t 
 
where At captures some exogenous growth of TFP  It will be convenient to bestow on At the 
exponential form 
At   A     
 t 
 
so that      
 t     can be thought of as the growth rate of TFP  We have written things 
in the slightly ugly form so as to simplify the expressions later 
One way to think about it is to interpret   as the growth rate of labor productivity  That 
would translate into output productivity by a power of      
Write the capital accumulation equation 
kt         kt   xt 
 
where   is the depreciation rate and x is the flow of fresh investment  By the savings 
investment equality and the Solow assumption that savings is proportional to per-capita 
income  we see that 
xt   syt 
 
where s is the savings rate  We can combine all these equations and proceed as follows 
Define k 
 
t 
  kt     
t 
  then the capital-accumulation equation implies that

k

and dividing through by      
t 
  we may conclude that 
     k 
 
t 
 
 
        s 
yt 
kt 
 
k 
 
t 
 
Now yt kt simply equals A k 
 
t 
 
  so that k 
 
t 
simply converges to k 
 
  where k 
 
is given by 
        s 
A 
k 
 
       
or 
k 
   
 
sA 
     
 
 
It follows that kt converges to the path 
     
t 
 
sA 
     
 
 
so that yt converges to the path 
A     
t 
 
sA 
     
 
 
We may therefore conclude that in steady state  the effect of varying the savings rate only 
depends on the ratio      
  The Calibration Game 
But this has small effects  We know that in a Cobb-Douglas world of perfect competition 
  is a good proxy for the share of capital in national income  Lucas   uses an estimate 
for that share of around   so that the ratio in question is around   This means that 
a doubling of the savings rate   a huge increase   will only raise steady state per-capita 
incomes by a factor of  
  which is around a   increase  This comes nowhere close to 
the inequalities we see around us 
Parente and Prescott   impute around   to labor income and   to land  which leaves 
them with a capital share of   With that our required ratio is even lower       
That means that a doubling of the savings rate only translates into a   variation in percapita 
income 
And moreover  the savings rates in the richest countries are nowhere close to double that 
of their poor counterparts  In   the industrialized countries averaged a savings rate of 
  The LDCs actually had a higher savings rate during that period       while 
even Africa had a savings rate of  
Notice that TFP differentials in productivity give us a better chance to explain differentials 
whereas across two countries   and

A

When   is   the savings difference translate into income differences as the square root 
while for technology differences the ratio is taken to the power   So  for instance  a 
doubling of the technology difference  explains  a difference of close to three times in percapita 
output  This is a bit closer to what we see  and it is small wonder  then  that those who 
are wedded to Solow-type convergence models have been inclined to focus on technological 
differences 
Actually  the above calibrations  which are due to Parente and Prescott    see also 
Mankiw  Romer and Weil   can be given a sharper and more immediate expresson by 
simply using the production function and no more  This is the route taken in Lucas  
Once again begin with the Cobb-Douglas production function 
y   Ak 
 note  no time subscripts  I won t even need to do any growth theory  Use the competitive 
condition to assert that the rate of return to capital is given by 
r   A k 
 
 
or equivalently 
r    A 
 y 
 
 
The Calibration Game  
Once again take the share of capital to be   then       so that across two countries  
and  
r 
r 
 
 
y 
y 
 
 
This yields absurd numbers  If the per-capita income in the US is   times larger than that of 
India  the rate of return on capital in India should be over   times higher  Even if the share 
of capital in production is taken to be    used by Lucas  the ratio in the rates of return 
should be close to   also plainly absurd 
There are alternative routes out of this dilemma 
  Differences in Human Capital  Of course  we should get the immediate alternative 
out of the way first  which is that labor qualities in the two countries are not the same  So 
differences in per-capita income are not the same as differences in income per  effective 
capita  For instance  Anne Krueger   attempts to compare US and Indian workers 
by looking at information on each country s mix of workers  by age  education and sector 
and combining this with  US-based  estimates of how these factors affect productivity  as 
measured by relative earnings 
Krueger obtains an overall ratio of one US worker   approx    Indian workers  This means 
that the ratio income per effective capita is   but this too generates a rate of return differential 
between    if capital s share is   and    if that share is set lower at   This difference is 
also  too large  and there is still a lot left to explain 
 Update on Krueger and per-capita income differentials  Heston  Summers and Aten  
argue that in   the PPP income differences were perhaps   Banerjee and Duflo  
adjust the Krueger estimates of relative worker productivity to about   This leaves us 
effectively in the same place  the adjusted ratio is then about   which creates the same 
differentials in the rates of return as in the previous paragraph 
  Differences in TFP  Now let s turn our attention to technological differences  Let 
us look at the implicit TFP ratios needed if we were to equalize rates of return in the two 
countries and maintain the requirement that per- effective  capita income ratios are around 
  Use subscripts I for India and U for the US  then the equality of the two rates of return to 
capital demands that

so that

provided that the share of capital is around a third  So this means that 
AU 
AI 
   
     
It is hard to get a feel for whether this is a large difference or a small one  One way of looking 
at it  if the US and India put in the same amounts of capital and quality-corrected labor into 
production  the US will produce twice as much as India  This may be a tall order 
  The Calibration Game 
Nother way  Lucas s view is that this difference is attributable to an externality created by 
human capital  Suppose that the externality is proportional to h 
a 
  where a is some coefficient 
and h is the human capital endowment per capita  Then

Lucas estimates a at around   using Denision s productivity comparisons within the 
United States over   and   and combining them with human capital endowments 
over the same period  Because       this takes care of the problem as far as Lucas is 
concerned 
  Misallocation of Capital  Another way to think about it is to generate the productivity 
differences from the misallocation of capital in a disaggregated model  Banerjee and 
Duflo   adopt this approach  but there is an interesting tension here  To generate 
serious misallocation problems  one must presume that the marginal product of capital is 
substantially different across small and large firms  But this means that capital has high 
curvature in production  so that one must choose correspondingly smaller values of  
Assuming that capital is misallocated cannot provide a ready fix on this problem 
That said  credit constraints and consequent misallocation of resources may well be 
important 
  The Share of Capital  One way out is to somehow enlarge the share of capital  and 
in this way the value of   Parente and Prescott   p    discuss this route in some 
detail  by considering intangible forms of capital and the possibility that physical capital is 
grossly mismeasured  but these adjustments are just not enough 
  Government Failure  One view is that governments might expropriate new investors 
while existing investors  who may be unproductive  are overprotected  This is 
a view in which incumbent elites are not necessarily the best business hands  yet they are 
in a position to control the entrance of others more efficient than they are  This is related 
to political-economy arguments made by Engerman and Sokoloff and Acemoglu-JohnsonRobinson 
that we will discuss later in the course 
Parente and Prescott consider a variant of this point of view  in which they regard the 
government as intervening excessively and thus lowering productivity 
Another sort of government failure may arise from the lack of intervention  such as 
intervention to protect property rights  Certain types of long-run investment may then 
not be made  see Besley  Bandiera  or Goldstein-Udry  Or there may be various free-rider 
problems in joint production  as also overexploitation of the commons 
  Summing Up 
Convergence relies on diminishing returns to  capital  If this is our assumed starting point 
the share of capital in national income does give us rough estimates of the concavity of 
The Calibration Game  
production in capital  The problem is that the resulting concavity understates observed 
variation in cross-country income by orders of magnitude  Huge variations in the savings 
rate do not change world income by much  For instance  doubling the savings rate leads 
to a change in steady state income by a factor of   which is inadequate to explain an 
observed range of around    PPP  Indeed  as Lucas   observes  the discrepancy 
actually appears in a more primitive way  at the level of the production function  even 
without the attendant steady state theory  For the same simple production function to fit 
the data on per-capita income differences  a poor country would have to have enormously 
higher rates of return to capital  say    times higher if it is one-fifteenth as rich  This is 
implausible  And so begins the hunt for other factors that might explain the difference 
What did we not control for  but should have 
This is the kind of mindset that you will take on board if you get on the convergence boat  The 
Solow benchmark of convergence must be tested against the empirical evidence on world 
income distributions  savings rates  or rates of return to capital  The two will usually fail to 
agree  Then we look for the missing variables that will bridge Solow  or some close variant 
thereof  to the data  Thus it is not uncommon to find economists  explaining  inter-country 
variation by stating that one country is more corrupt than another  or more democratic  or 
is imbued with some particularly hardworking cultural ethic 
With careful economists such as the ones I have cited here  the argument is conducted far 
more responsibly   Human capital  is often used as a first port of call  might differences 
here account for observed cross-country variation  The rest is usually attributed to that 
familiar black box   technological differences  As one might imagine  that slot can be 
filled in a variety of ways  externalities arising from human capital  incomplete diffusion of 
technology  excessive government intervention  within-country misallocation of resources 
take your pick  All of these   and more   are interesting candidates  but by now we have 
wandered far from the original convergence model  and if at all that model still continues 
to illuminate  it is by way of occasional return to the recalibration exercise  after choosing 
plausible specifications for each of these potential explanations 
The Solow model and its immediate variants don t do a bad job  In the right hands 
the model serves as a quick and ready fix on the world  and it organizes a search for 
possible explanations  Taken with the right grain of salt  and viewed as a first pass  such 
an exercise can be immensely useful  At another level  playing this game too seriously 
reveals a particular world-view  It suggests a fundamental belief that the world economy 
is ultimately a great leveller  and that if the levelling is not taking place we must search 
for that explanation in parameters that are somehow structurally rooted in a society  These 
parameters cause economic growth  or the lack of it 
To be sure  the factors identified in these calibration exercises do go hand in hand with 
underdevelopment  So do bad nutrition  high mortality rates  or lack of access to sanitation 
safe water and housing  Yet there is no ultimate causal chain  many of these features go hand 
in hand with low income in self-reinforcing interplay  By the same token  corruption  culture 
procreation and politics are all up for serious cross-examination  just because  cultural 
factors   for instance  seems more weighty an  explanation  does not permit us to assign it 
the status of a truly exogenous variable 
  The Calibration Game 
In other words  the convergence predicted by technologically diminishing returns to inputs 
should not blind us to the possibility of nonconvergent behavior when all variables are 
treated as they should be   as variables that potentially make for underdevelopment  but 
also as variables that are profoundly affected by the development process 
This leads to a different way of asking the development question  one that is not grounded 
in any presumption of convergence  Quite unlike the convergence hypothesis  the starting 
presumption is distinct  two economies with the same fundamentals can move apart along 
very different paths  Several factors might lead to such divergence  among them various 
processes of cumulative causation  or poverty-traps  or initial histories that determined  
at least to some degree   the future that followed

  A   R 
where A is the product of the actions sets  Say that this game exhibits complementarities if 
whenever a i   a 
 
 i 
  then 
arg max 
ai

It will suffice for the purpose of these notes to provide a simplified and more special 
description  Suppose that a set of individuals all have access to some set of actions A 
taken to be a subset of the real line  Denote by a a generic action  ai 
the action taken by 
individual i  and by mi 
the average of all actions other than the one taken by i 
Assume that the payoff function is given by  i a  m  for each individual i  where a denotes 
his action and m denotes the average action taken by everybody else  Then it is easy to see 
that there are complementarities in our more general sense if for all i 
   i a  m     i a 
 
  m  is increasing in m 
whenever a   a 
  are two actions in the set A 
Notice the difference between complementarities and positive externalities  The former 
change the marginal gain to taking an action while the latter affects payoff levels  Changes in 
the marginal gain are compatible with payoff levels going in either direction 
As we shall see  Pareto-ordered outcomes are typical of these situations  though they won t 
necessarily happen 
  Some Examples 
  Qwerty  There are two technologies  call them  Q werty and  D vorak  There are 
many individuals  each of whom employs a single Q-trained secretary or a single D-trained 
secretary  The cost of installing each technology is the same  but the cost expended on a 
  Expectations and Multiple Equilibrium 
secretary is a decreasing function of the number of other people using the same secretary 
type   More secretarial schools exist for that type  This is a situation of complementarities 
The same goes for technologies such as PCs and Macs  in which the benefits from adopting 
the technology depend positively on the number of other users  networking 
  Infrastructure  A railroad is used for transporting products from the interior to the 
ports  People are indexed on     and person i gets a benefit B i  from being able to use the 
railroad  The cost of railroad use is declining in the number of users  c n  where n is the 
number of users and c 
 
 n      This is a situation of complementarities 
  Finance  A thicker financial market caused by lots of people putting their money 
in financial assets can create the possibilities of greater diversification  So at the margin  it 
becomes easier for an individual investor to invest 
  Capital Deepening  Greater roundaboutness in production increases the productivity 
of capital  the scale of aggregate production  and in this way the final demand 
for individual machine varieties  This may in turn justify the greater roundaboutness of 
production 
  Social Capital  High rural-urban migration can destroy social capital back in rural 
areas  In turn  that destruction can increase the pace of rural-urban migration 
  Discrimination  Individuals discriminated against may not invest in human capital 
perpetuating that discrimination 
  Currency Crises  Apart from the fundamentals of holding or selling a currency 
there is a strong incentive to sell if other individuals are selling  This forms the basis of a 
class of currency-crisis theories based on complementarities 
  Endogenous Growth  Economy-wide investment raises the return to individual 
investment  thus potentially generating a sustainable growth path 
  Social Norms  Sometimes  social norms can change a Prisoner s Dilemma to a 
coordination game  Examples  spitting in public  throwing garbage on the streets  or 
engaging in tariff wars  Sometimes repeated interactions can imitate the same outcome 
 though with many agents this is hard 
  Complementarities and Development 
The ordinary view of capitalist development is that it inflicts negative externalities  pollution 
greed and so on  This is certainly true  But there is an important sense in which the capitalist 
investment process creates severe complementarities  whether the underlying externalities 
are negative or positive  they could be either 
Expectations and Multiple Equilibrium  
For instance  a firm that prides itself on quality and fair dealing will induce its competitors 
to take the same actions simply to maintain business competitiveness  and could spark off a 
quality race  the same applies to research and innovation  or indeed  low prices  Note that 
the underlying externalities are negative but that we have a case of complementarities in the 
appropriate action space 
In another context  the combined actions of several firms can  a  lower infrastructural costs 
 b  create demand for each others  products  both directly and  c  by creating higher incomes 
and can  d  enable the creation of new products or the startup of some other productive 
activity by making inputs available  These are complementarities  too  in the sense that 
these actions of  investment  increase the incentive for other firms to  invest  as well  This 
time the externalities are positive 
So complementarities can exist both with positive and with negative externalities  Indeed 
the medieval guild system was designed to avoid some of the complementaries which had 
negative externalities attached to them   e g  a new improvement had to be sanctioned 
by existing guild members  As you can imagine  such an outcome cannot be stable unless 
severe punishments were available for offenders  and such punishments themselves became 
weaker as the guild system died away  provoking others to leave the guilds   Thus the guild 
story is also one of complementarities 
It is very important to understand that while the distinction between positive and negative 
externalities is important in understanding the normative properties of a particular 
equilibrium  the distinction between complementarities and what might be called anticomplementarities 
 reverse the movement of   in others  actions  is essential in understanding 
the possible variety in the development experience  Complementarities create the 
possibility of multiple equilibria  so that we might argue that countries   or societies   are 
in different equilibria though there is nothing intrinsically different between them 
  Multiple Equilibrium 
  Complementarities through Demand  How do complementarities manifest themselves 
in multiple equilibria  One way to begin exploring this is through the standard 
general equilibrium model  Understand  first  that some amount of limited competition is 
necessary  If the price at which an output is being sold  or an input being bought  is fixed 
then the agent can inflict no externality on another   he internalizes these externalities 
through the price  But if the price drops as you sell more of a product  or the input price 
raises  you are creating a gain for another agent that you fail to internalize  Thus perfect 
competition may be at odds with the multiple equilibrium story that creates a set of Paretodominating 
equilibria  of course  multiple equilibria that are Pareto-undominated are clearly 
possible by classical considerations 
The route envisaged by Rosenstein-Rodan was two-fold  Investments everywhere create a 
climate for more investment   a  directly  via intersectoral changes in price  and  b  indirectly 
via the generation of incomes  The parable of the shoe-factory emphasized  b  This is the 
Rosenstein-Rodan story as extended by Murphy  Shleifer and Vishny  
  Expectations and Multiple Equilibrium 
  Pecuniary Externalities  Before I get into the Murphy-Shleifer-Vishny model it is 
important to observe that the Rosenstein-Rodan view is one of pecuniary externalities  in 
which one sort of change  investment  provokes another  investment somewhere else  via a 
change in prices  Such externalities are to be contrasted with what one might call technological 
externalities  in which there is a direct effect that has nothing to do with prices   Using a PC 
when lots of other people use a PC is a networking effect that is a technological externality 
Of course  one could also tell a pecuniary story in which a big market for PCs drives down 
their prices and therefore makes it more attractive to buy one 
Pecuniary externalities are natural  Tibor Scitovsky   in a famous article  argued that 
they are orders of magnitude more compelling than technological externalities  Indeed 
because of Rosenstein-Rodan and Hirschman  pecuniary externalities are viewed as the 
fundamental process underlying development  or the lack of it 
But percuniary externalities are hard to model using competitive markets  Basically the 
first fundamental theorem of welfare economics stands in the way  That theorem rules 
out Pareto-ranked equilibria whenever there are no technological externalities  Let us very 
quickly review the theorem in the context of a CRS production model 
Suppose that each person i has a utility function ui and a vector of endowments x i  The 
total endowment vector is x  
P 
i x i  Denote by c the vector of final consumption goods  it 
is allocated among the population of all individuals with person i getting c i 
There is a production technology T to convert x into c  Thus T is a set of feasible  c  x 
output-input pairs  We don t make any particular assumption on T 
Note that production may generate positive profits so we have to distribute them among 
the agents  Let  i  be the share of aggregate profits   that accrue to agent i 
Finally  there is a price vector p for the final goods and w for the endowments  Say that 
 p 
 
  w 
 
  c  i  is a competitive equilibrium if  defining c 
   
P 
i 
c 
 
 i  we have profit maximization 
    p 
 
c 
    w 
 
x   p 
 
c 
    w 
 
x 
 
for all  c 
 
  x 
 
    T 
and utility maximization subject to budget constraints 
c 
 
 i  maximizes u c i  on  c i p 
 
c i    w 
 
x i     i 
Proposition   A competitive equilibrium is Pareto optimal  so in particular there can be no 
Pareto-ranked equilibria 
Proof  Suppose not  Then there exists an alternative vector of outputs c  feasible  so that 
 c  x    T  and an allocation c i  of it such that u c j    u c 
 
 j  for all j  with strict inequality 
for some j  But then by utility maximization  we must have 
p 
 
c j    p 
 
c 
 
 j  for all j  with strict inequality for some j 
and adding over all j  we must conclude that 
p 
 
c   p 
 
c 
 
 
Substracting the common term w 
 x from both sides of this inequality  we contradict the profit 
maximization property 
Expectations and Multiple Equilibrium  
This is why we employ some imperfect competition in the models of pecuniary externalities 
that follow 
  Model   The Profit Externality  There is a continuum of sectors indexed by q      
The utility function for a consumer is 
Z  
 
ln x q dq 
With this utility function  when consumer income is given by y  an amount of y is spent on 
every good q 
Now  normalize wage rate to unity  then y       L  where   is profits and L is the labor 
endowment of a typical agent 
Now suppose that each sector has two technologies  a cottage technology which is freely 
available without any setup cost  and an industrialized technology  which requires a setup 
cost  In the former  assume that one unit of labor produces one unit of output  In the latter 
assume one unit of labor produces   units of output  where       But there is a setup cost 
which we denote by F    
Now the cottage sector is competitive  while demand for each good is unitary elastic  so it 
follows that if there is industrialization in some sector the price will be set at the limit price 
equal to one  Thus the profit from industrialization is given by 
  y  
y 
 
  F  
     
 
y   F   ay   F 
The point  therefore  is that a larger y is more conducive to industrialization  To complete 
the circle  more industrialization is also conducive to a larger value of y  To see this  notice 
that if a fraction n of the sectors do industrialize  then profits per firm are 
 n    ay   F 
so that aggregate income y n  is given by 
y n    n n    L   n ay n    F    L 
or equivalently 
  y n   
L   nF 
    an 
 
Notice that 
y 
 
 n   
 aL   F    an 
    an 
and that 
   n    ay n    F  
aL   F 
    an 
so that combining these two equations we get 
  y 
 
 n   
 n 
    an 
  Expectations and Multiple Equilibrium 
Note that   exhibits a multiplier-like quality because of the externality  Extra profits 
create more than their own weight in income  while higher income in turn can spur 
industrialization  This is a classic case of complementarities 
But it isn t so classic in one respect  Oddly enough  despite the complementarity  there can 
only be a single equilibrium in this model  If F   aL  then this means that at y    L it is 
worth industrializing  so everyone will  On the other hand  if F   aL  then from equation  
it is not worth industrializing even when income is all the way at y   set n     in   and 
evaluate  
 To be sure  when F   aL there are  in fact  a continuum of equilibria but they are all 
equivalent in that they generate the same level of national income 
One possible  explanation  for uniqueness is that the model is too simple  there isn t enough 
heterogeneity among the firms  Let s satisfy ourselves that this has nothing to do with it 
Suppose that the fixed costs vary smoothly across sectors  all the way from zero to infinity 
Order the sectors so that F      F      and F i  is smoothly increasing  Then if n sectors 
invest  it must be the interval of firms   n  that s doing the investing  and the following 
zero-profit condition must hold 
  ay n    F n     
where 
  y n   
Z n 
 
  i di   L 
and 
    i    ay n    F i 
for each i  Let A n  denote the average value of all the fixed costs on   n  then combining 
  and   we see that 
y n    any n    nA n    L 
or 
y n   
L   nA n 
    an 
 
and using this information in   and moving terms around  we see that 
      an F n    anA n    aL 
is the fully reduced-form zero-profit condition  Can there be more than one solution in n 
to this condition  Differentiating the LHS of   shows that the derivative is     an F 
 
 n 
which is positive  There cannot be more than one solution 
Why does the complementarity have no effect  It does not because the externality is 
generated by the payoff of the firm  At all points for which the marginal payoff is positive 
 and so is the externality  the firm pushes ahead and produces more  It does not internalize 
the externality but it does not need to   the privately profitable and the socially profitable 
moves coincide  Likewise for the case in which profits are negative  There is a cutback which 
Expectations and Multiple Equilibrium  
enhances both private and social outcomes at the same time  So even though there is an 
externality  the actions fully internalize the externality  as it were 
One lesson from all this is that the Rosenstein-Rodan intuition needs to be examined more 
carefully  The source of the complementarity must be something other than private profit 
alone 
The main idea in what follows   and this is perhaps the lesson of the Murphy-ShleiferVishny 
exercise   is that  to obtain multiplicity  one needs an externality source which isn t 
effectively internalized by the externality provider  For instance  if there are taxes on output 
 with proceeds given  say  lump-sum to the economy  then the profit-maximum for a firm 
will not correspond to the point at which the marginal externality washes out  Likewise for 
the example that we discuss below 
  Model   The Wage Externality  Suppose that industrialization not only benefits 
the industrializing firm  it also benefits workers in that firm in the form of higher wages 
These higher wages need not mean higher utility  they could be compensation for a higher 
disutility of labor  Or they may be Shapiro-Stiglitz type wages designed to prevent shirking 
in a hard-to-monitor activity  Or there may be political and economic pressures to keep 
wages above some stipulated minimum in the organized industrial sector 
Let the  additive  wage premium be v  so that the wage to be paid is     v  Now the 
monopolists s profit from industrializing in any particular sector is 
      y   
    v 
  
y   F    v 
when the total demand for that sector is given by y 
This specification can generate multiple equilibria  If there is no industrialization  then 
y   L  This is self-justifying if profits  evaluated at this level of income  are nonpositive 
That is  using   we have the condition 
  L 
 
    
    v 
  
 
  F    v     
On the other hand  to see if one can have an equilibrium in which all industrialize  one must 
have the condition that profits are nonnegative when aggregate income  and hence demand 
is evaluated at the full-industrialization point  Aggregate income is given by 
y        L    v   
 
   
    v 
 
 
y    F    v    L    v 
or 
  y     L   F 
 This is an intuitive expression  since the RHS corresponds to the total output produced  So 
profits are nonnegative at the full industrialization point if 
 
   
    v 
 
 
 L   F    F    v     
  Expectations and Multiple Equilibrium 
and rewriting this  we obtain the condition 
  L 
 
   
    v 
 
 
  F    
Now   and   can easily be compared to see why multiplicity is possible 
A similar exercise can be carried out using the heterogeneous-cost variant  Make the same 
assumptions on the function F i  as before  Then the equilibrium condition is given by 
  y n 
 
   
    v 
 
 
  F n    v 
Notice that 
y n   
Z n 
 
 i di   L   v 
Z n 
 
F i di  
vny n 
 
 
where 
 i    y n   
    v 
 
y n        v F i 
and combining these last two equations we see that 
y n    ny n 
 
   
    v 
 
 
  L       v 
Z n 
 
F i di   v 
Z n 
 
F i di  
vny n 
 
  any n    L  
Z n 
 
  F i di 
Employing   in   we see that 
L  
R n 
 
F i di 
    an  
   
    v 
 
 
  F n    v 
or 
  L  
Z n 
 
F i di   F n   
    v    an 
        v 
 Notice that   reduces to   when v     so that there is no possibility of multiple 
equilibrium when v    
You can differentiate both sides of this condition  just as we did before  to provide restrictions 
for which multiple equilibria are possible 
Model   Separation of Costs and Benefits 
Another example of the general principle discussed earlier  but we don t do this in class  of minor 
importance 
If the setup costs and the later revenues are separated in time  then the latter will drive 
demand  while industrializers care about revenues net of setup costs  This will be sufficient 
to drive a wedge between private and socially optimal decision-making 
Expectations and Multiple Equilibrium  
There is a problem though  For the economy to go through this deferred industrialization 
process  the interest rate must rise to encourage consumption postponement  For the 
industrializers  this brings up the opportunity cost of investing in industrialization 
If no one industrializes  then income is  L  L  and    
 
 r 
solves out for the interest rate  So 
the condition for no industrialization is simply 
   aL   F    
On the other hand  if full industrialzation occurs  current output is L   F and in the next 
period it is  L  This must be rationalized by the Euler equation for aggregate consumption 
If u denotes the indirect utility of current consumption of the composite  then solve 
max u c     u c 
subject to 
c   
 
    r 
c    present value of income 
so that 
 
    r 
   
u

It follows that the condition for full industrialization is 
   a L

 L

  F    
Are   and   compatible  Yes  if the interest rate does not rise by too much   Actually 
with the logarithmic specification employed by Murphy  Shleifer and Vishny   this does 
not work  but if the indirect utility function of composite consumption has higher elasticity 
than logarithmic    and   can be compatible 
  Complementarity through the Production Process   The division of labor is 
limited by the size of the market  Thus spake Adam Smith  and he spake well  A large 
market size encourages investments that may be complicated and costly  but have immensely 
high productivity  The deeper insight of Allyn Young was to note that the converse is also 
true  the  division of labor  or production roundaboutness  also determines the size of the 
market  In this sense  roundaboutness begets roundaboutness 
The example that we consider has to do with the provision of intermediate inputs that 
are required in the production of final output in the economy  One feature of economic 
development is the creation and use of increasingly sophisticated methods of production 
often characterized by their  roundaboutness  Almost any productive activity can serve 
as an example  Let s take construction  In developing countries  construction is a pretty 
labor-intensive activity  The area is cleared by hand  rubble is removed in small baskets 
carried by hand  cement is often mixed at the site and carried by hand  and walls are put 
up brick by brick  In industrialized economies  each of these tasks has been automated 
cranes are used for clearing and prefabricated walls are erected at the site  Each automated 
instrument  in turn  is produced through a complicated activity  think about how cranes 
and prefabricated walls are themselves produced  Thus the final production of a house is 
reduced to a large series of automated steps  each of a high degree of sophistication and 
requiring the provision of many intermediate inputs 
  Expectations and Multiple Equilibrium 
These sophisticated inputs can be extremely costly to produce if they going to be sold in tiny 
markets  The manufacture and sale of cranes requires that there be a fairly large demand 
for cranes in construction  and so it is with prefabricated walls  Otherwise it is simply not 
worth setting up separate plants to manufacture these items  In other words  intermediate 
inputs are often produced under conditions of increasing returns to scale 
At the same time  the provision of intermediate inputs  and the consequent roundaboutness 
of production  can have very productive consequences  because production not only benefits 
from scale  it also benefits from the variety of inputs that are employed  To see this in concrete 
terms  suppose that output is produced using a constant returns to scale technology that 
includes as inputs intermediate goods as well as labor  If the quantity of labor as well as of all 
existing varieties of intermediate inputs is doubled  then output doubles  this is just a feature 
of constant returns to scale  This notion suggests that if the production budget is doubled 
output doubles too  Not so  simply because a doubling of all inputs is only one option under 
a doubling of the budget  It is also possible to expand the variety of intermediate inputs that 
are used in production  The option to expand variety leads to a situation where output more 
than doubles  with input variety  increasing returns to scale is built in provided that the 
underlying production function exhibits constant returns  It follows that the productivity 
of the economy depends on the scale and richness of operations of the intermediate goods 
sector 
To formalize this  suppose that an intermediate good   which we loosely call capital  - is 
 produced  by means of several intermediate inputs  machines  Machines are indexed by 
i  they appear on a continuum     The more machines are used  the more variety there 
is in the production process  but all machines are used ina symmetric way  the easiest way 
to capture this is to suppose that 
  X  
 Z n 
 
x i 
 
 
  di 
where n is an index of the variety of machines or the roundaboutness of production  and 
      proxies the degree of substitution across machines  This is like a CES production 
function where the elasticity of substitution exceeds    so that no one machine is necessary 
in the production process 
Suppose that capital is produced by means of a  budget  K which can be used   at a 
normalized price of one   to produce intermediate inputs  Then by strict concavity of the 
production function in   and the symmetry of the problem  the budget would be equally 
divided among available machines  so that K   xn would solve for x  the quantity of each 
machine used in the production process  Consequently 
  X    n  K n 
 
    n 
 K 
It is in this sense that variety can be equated with total factor productivity 
We are now in a position to see how this leads to multiple equilibria  Suppose that the 
economy is  poor  and exhibits a low demand for the final product  This situation means 
that intermediate production cannot occur at an economically viable scale  which means 
that the prices of intermediate goods are high  Consequently  firms substitute away from 
intermediate goods to the use of raw labor  This lowers productivity because of the argument 
Expectations and Multiple Equilibrium  
in the previous paragraph and generates low income in the economy  Low income in turn 
generates a low demand for the final good  and the vicious cycle is complete  The other side 
of the coin is a virtuous circle  High demand for the final consumption good increases the 
demand for intermediates  and because these intermediates are produced under conditions 
of increasing returns to scale  prices of intermediates fall  Falling prices encourage a further 
substitution away from labor to intermediates  which raises the productivity of the economy 
Incomes rise as a consequence and so does demand  completing the virtuous circle 
A formalization follows  based on Ciccone and Matsuyama  
The idea of this exercise is to endogenize the degree of roundaboutness in production  notice 
in passing that the same kind of analysis can be carried out using variety in consumption 
To this end  we suppose that each of the machine sectors must be set up  with a fixed cost of S 
denominated in terms of labor  before production can commence  Thereafter production of 
machines takes place under constant returns to scale  see description below  Each machine 
sector is run by a monopolist  but since different machines can   in principle   be very 
close substitutes in production  there are limitations on his pricing behavior  This is what 
we begin by exploring 
Imagine that varieties   n  are in force  Then producers of the final good will demand a 
quantity x i  of machine i  chosen to 
max F 
 
 
Z n 
 
x i 
 di 
 
  L 
 
  wL  
Z n 
 
p i x i di 
Of course  the input i is of measure   but the following calculation can easily be justified by 
thinking of this as an approximation for a large but finite number of input varieties  The 
necessary and sufficient first-order condition is 
FX 
 
     
 
Z n

 Note  p i x i

  so demand is elastic 
Now turn attention to machine producers  Suppose that machines are produced using labor 
alone  and that a units of labor are needed to produce one unit of a machine  Then the 
marginal cost of producing y units of a machine is given by way  where w is the wage rate 
Using  we can conclude that producers of the intermediate good will choose p i  to 
max 
F 
 
X

and  because each machine is of measure   this is equivalent to the problem 
max

p i 
 
 
wa 
p i 
 
 
You should check that the first-order conditions characterizing this problem are necessary 
and sufficient  They are 
     p i 
    wa p i 
     
or 
p i   
wa 
     
 
To make things easier to write  choose units of labor so that a         then 
  p i    w for all i 
Before we go on to determine varieties  think of what it will now cost to buy one unit of the 
composite capital X  given that this price determination process is in place  Recall that the 
composite is 
X  
 Z n 
 
x i 
 di 
  n 
 x 
because the same amount of every machine is bought given the pricing rule   So the 
effective price of X   call it P   is given by 
P  
cost of buying X 
X

Thus P w   the effective relative factor price   is equal to n 
 
  which is declining in n 
So if F is CRS and we denote by    
FX X L X 
F X L 
the factor share of X in production  then 
       n 
 
    A n 
If the elasticity of substitution between X and L exceeds unity  A n  is an increasing function 
 it is flat if F is Cobb-Douglas 
Now we return to the problem of determining equilibrium variety  Denoting the value of 
final output by Y  the operating profit for a producer of intermediates is given by

where the second equality follows from the pricing rule p   w  the third equality from the

Equation   tells us that an increase in variety has three effects on the operating profit of 
a typical producer of intermediates 
Expectations and Multiple Equilibrium  
  A larger n increases variety and this decreases the share to each variety  this is the  n 
term 
  A larger n affects the factor share of intermediates  generally in a positive direction  this 
is the A n  term 
  A larger n affects final output  and therefore national income 
Now let us go ahead and finish the endogenization of n using the free-entry condition

This expression tells us that the potential for multiplicity is intimately linked to the behavior 
of n A n    to its possible nonmonotonicity in n  to be more accurate  For instance  in the 
Cobb-Douglas case  A n  is a constant as we have already seen  so that there is a unique 
level of product variety in the economy  On the other hand  if A n  increases sharply with 
n  at least over some range  then the complementarity is strong and multiple equilibria are 
indeed possible 
  Complementarity and Finance  The focus in this section is not so much the idea 
of multiple equilibria as the notion of how externalities might permeate the development 
process through different channels  In this section we study the financial sector 
It is well known that financial deepening is one of the characteristics of the development 
process  The introduction of money into a subsistence economy opens up opportunities 
for trade that never existed before  Similarly  the expansion of the credit system opens up 
new opportunities for investment  and this is taken one step further when a stock market 
comes into being  Now  the investment-enhancing effects of financial deepening are well 
worth studying  but we concentrate here on a slightly different set of questions  how is the 
availability of finance  from end-savers  tied to the extent of financial deepening 
The answer that we would like to explore is that financial deepening offers opportunities for 
diversification  and this encourages a greater flow of savings from low-risk  but low-return 
activities to the higher-risk  but higher-return  sectors  To be sure  the greater flow permits 
in its turn  greater deepening of the financial market  This is the phenomenon explored in 
this section  we draw on Acemoglu and Zilibotti  
Notice that if each sector costs nothing to set up  then large amounts of diversification can 
be achieved even with small amounts of finance by simply spreading the available finance 
arbitrarily thinly over the existing sectors  Thus the idea of setup costs  or more generally  a 
nonconvexity  must enter the picture again 
  Expectations and Multiple Equilibrium 
Begin by looking at individual choices  Suppose that financial securities for different 
production sectors are indexed by j       Sector j pays off a return of R if state j occurs 
States are realized with uniform probability on    
Notice that our goal is not to examine the determinants of productivity in each sector  as we 
did earlier  nor do we ascribe different rates of return to each production sector  The only 
goal here is to examine diversification possibilities 
Suppose that a measure n of sectors is  open  at any particular date  Rearrange sectors so 
that we can think of these as sectors in   n  where     n     Now an agent must assign 
his current assets to a savings portfolio  Denote assets by A  The sectors available are all 
these  of measure n  and a riskless sector which pays a return factor of r  That is  if an agent 
assigns a fraction   of his savings to the risky portfolios  and owns a  density  f j  of asset 
j  his return in state j is 
c j         Ar    AR f j  if j     n 
         Ar if j     n 
Assume for now that these returns are all consumed  later we outline a model that allows 
for this as well as for other possibilities  Assume that the agent is risk-averse and that his 
utility is given by the familiar functional 
Z  
 
ln c j dj 
Substituting in the value of c j  from   we see that the agent s objective is to choose  
and the density f j  to maximize 
  Z n 
 
ln 
     Ar    AR f j 
 
dj       n  ln      Ar   
subject to the constraints that         f j      for j   n  and R n 
 
f j dj    
The first thing to note about this maximization problem is that given any value of   the 
density f j  must be uniform over   n  This equalizes agent returns over all states in   n 
and by second-order stochastic dominance the agent must prefer this to any other allocation 
over the risky portfolio  Consequently  our maximization problem reduces to the task of 
finding         to maximize 
  n ln  
     Ar  
 AR 
n 
 
      n  ln      Ar

conditions yourself

Expectations and Multiple Equilibrium  
Notice that   is increasing in n  simply differentiate   This summarizes our intuition 
that the greater the amount of financial deepening  as proxied by n  the the greater the 
amount of savings coming into the  risky  financial sector 
Now we move away from the individual level to understand some more about the process 
of opening new financial sectors  Specifically  we wish to caputure the possibility that some 
sectors require certain minimum investment sizes in order to open  and that these can vary 
from sector to sector  the easiest way to do this is to suppose that there is a function S i 
defined on     that captures the cost of opening a new sector i  We order sectors  this 
will not be at variance with our previous ordering  so that S i  is increasing   assume it is 
smooth  with S     
The macroeconomic equilibrium at any one point of time can now be described 
Assuming that n sectors are open  investment per sector   as we have seen   is given by 
the amount 
 A 
n 
 
R   r 
R   rn 
A 
using   It follows that the equilibrium financial depth is given by 
  R   r 
R   rn 
A   S n 
To be sure  there may be multiple solutions to this equation for the usual reason that there 
are multiple equilibria  but we are not going to pay this too much attention  The point that 
we wish to emphasize is this   as long as there is no equilibrium that involves maximal depth 
 n     every equilibrium is Pareto-inefficient  There are externalities in the process that will 
not go away  even if coordination failures are resolved 
To understand why  notice that the opening of a fresh sector confers positive benefits on 
all agents  simply because of the diversification possibilities that are involved  However 
individual agents wish to equalize their holdings across sectors  This tendency towards 
equalization means that sectors with large setup requirements cannot be accomodated  At 
the margin  some accomodation must be beneficial  This is the source of the inefficiency 
To make this point more precisely  imagine a situation in which a social planner chooses not 
only   and the portfolio for the representative agent in the economy  but also the value of n 
In other words  such a planner would actually maximize 
  Z n 
 
ln 
     Ar    AR f j 
 
dj       n  ln      Ar   
subject to all the constraints described after   and a suitable choice of n  under the 
additional constraint that  A f j    S j  for all j     n 
The solution to this problem is a bit more complicated because of this last constraint  In 
particular  equal division of the portfolio cannot be assured  But what we can say is this  if 
 A f j    S j 
over any interval of securities  then over that interval we must have equal division of the 
portfolio  For if not  a second-order dominance move can be created without violating 
any of the constraints  It follows that along some interval   n  we have equal division 
  Expectations and Multiple Equilibrium 
while possibly along an additional interval  n  n 
 
  we have portfolio holdings that exactly 
compensate for the fixed cost of those sectors  So our maximization problem may be rewritten 
as  choose n  n 
 
 not less than n  and         to maximize 
  n ln      Ar   S n R   
Z n

ln      Ar   S i R  di       n

Set up the Lagrangean

  ln      Ar

and write down the Kuhn-Tucker conditions  we ll only need to do so for the derivatives 
with respect to n 
  and n 
  ln      Ar   S n 
 
 R    ln      Ar     S n

    n 
and 
  nS 
 n R 
     Ar   S n R 
   nS 
 n      with equality if n    
Now the question is  is it ever possible for an equilibrium to satisfy the Kuhn-Tucker 
conditions  which  as we know  are necessary for an optimum   Never mind whether they 
are sufficient  The answer is no  To see this  notice that in an equilibrium  n      because 
S      Consequently    holds with equality  so that 
   
R 
     Ar   S n R 
 
Therefore  if n   n 
 
    implies that 
  ln      Ar   S n R    ln      Ar   
RS n 
     Ar   S n R 
 
But this contradicts the strict concavity of the logarithmic function  We know that ln y   
ln x     y   x y  Applying this to x        Ar and y        Ar   S n R  we may conclude 
that 
ln      Ar   S n R    ln      Ar   
RS n 
     Ar   S n R 
 
which contradicts  
It follows that we must always have n 
    n in the social planning problem  that is  some 
sectors must be  cross-subsidized  But no agent wants to take up the burden of crosssubsidization 
Given that other agents are holding unequal portfolios in order to keep a 
sector open  a given agent will always want to allocate his portfolio equally among the 
sectors  To be sure  if all agents do so  some sectors will have to close down  perpetuating 
the inefficiency 
Expectations and Multiple Equilibrium  
Observe that the financial deepening problem has implications for the pace of development 
as well as its uncertainty  In countries with small asset levels  proxied by A  aggregate 
development will be beset by frequent crises  as full insurance  diversification  is not possible 
Extend the model a little bit to recursively define A in each period in one of two ways 
  A is the product of savings decisions made by young agents who only earn a wage  the 
wage is the marginal product of labor evaluated at the going capital stock of the economy 
Total returns to the financial sector constitute the amount of capital  which is ploughed 
into the deterministic production of a final good  under an Inada-style production function 
Agents live two periods  This is the approach taken by Acemoglu-Zilibotti and this model 
can be easily embedded into sucha dynamic model 
  A is the product of savings decisions made by long-lived agents  in which the log utility 
function postulated here must be viewed as the value function of a dynamic program with 
underlying utility functions also logarithmic  Income is then the sum of wages and capital 
returns at any date  This is a bit more complicated as a dynamic program needs to be solved 
With either of these extensions  A will fluctuate for long periods of time at low levels  if one 
starts low  until a certain asset level is reached that permits full or near-full diversification 
At this point the economy settles down to a steady rate of growth  Thus  while the ergodic 
behavior of all economies is the same  the transitions can be very different  for a poor 
economy  the steady state can be a long time coming 
Notice in conclusion that this is one view of history-dependence  Another has to do with 
the possibility that long run behavior may also be different depending on initial conditions 
This is what we take up in coming sections of the course 
 
CHAPTER  
History Versus Expectations 
So far  we ve discussed the existence of a virtuous circle of expectations that might lead 
communities to Pareto-superior states among multiple potential equilibria  As we have 
already noted  it is possible to think of these as generalized coordination games  Once the 
game-theoretic analogy is pressed into service  however  certain troubling issues arise 
Rosenstein-Rodan and Hirschman were concerned with multiple equilibria  no question 
but this was only the starting point of their analysis  They took it as self-evident that history 
somehow plays a role in pinning down the  starting equilibrium  and that the role of policy 
would be to construct ways of  moving  society from one equilibrium to another 
It is of interest to note that the theory of pure coordination games makes it very difficult 
if not impossible  to ask this question in a well-defined way  Imagine a sequence of such 
situations  Suppose that a bad equilibrium outcome has been in force for the previous  
plays of the game  In what sense does that make it more likely that in the  st iteration 
the bad equilibrium will occur again  Formulated in this way  the answer must be  in no 
sense at all  For as is well-known  all sorts of complicated switches between the good and 
bad equilibria can actually constitute a perfect equilibrium of the repeated game  There is 
no role for history in such a formulation 
Thus  by and large  this literature ignores a central question raised by Rosenstein-Rodan and 
Hirschman  how does an economy  move from a bad to a good equilibrium  We place this 
entire phrase in quotes because it is imprecise  so called transitions from one  equilibrium 
to another must themselves be viewed as the equilibria of some encompassing intertemporal 
process 
It appears  unless some convincing psychological model can be found that weds people to 
the historical status quo  that some sort of state variable is needed to make sense of the 
Rosenstein-Rodan Hirschman argument   This will also serve as a tentative introduction to 
the next part of the course in which such state variables  such as initial inequalities  are strong 
enough to pin down a unique equilibrium  But the state variable must be introduced in 
some  economical way  that does not rule out   by fiat or by assumption   the possibility 
of moving to a new equilibrium 
  History Versus Expectations 
In what follows  we look at some different approaches to the question of equilibrium-picking 
when there is potential coordnation failure 
  State Variables and Common Knowledge 
The first avenue that we explore is due to Morris and Shin    see also Carlsson and 
Van Damme   The basic idea is very simple and very powerful  Suppose that a 
coordination game is played between several agents   we shall write a concrete one down 
in a moment   and that the realization of a state variable affects the payoffs  Suppose that 
for certain values of the state variable the play of one action or the other is a dominant 
strategy  but for other values of the state there is a coordination problem  If the realization 
of the state variable is common knowledge  there is no bite at all in introducing the state 
variable  each realization of the state precipitates a different game  and each game is played 
separately 
But suppose that there isn t common knowledge of the realizations  Suppose that we all 
see the realized value with a bit of noise  Then I know that you have seen something  but 
you may have seen something a bit different from me  Now there isn t a string of separate 
games for each realization of the state variable  The implications can be surprising  as the 
following model of financial crises reveals 
Consider a country which has pegged its exchange rate at some value e   For concreteness 
think of e as the number of dollars required to buy one unit of the domestic currency  We 
shall assume that this exchange rate is unambiguously overvalued  in the following sense 
suppose that there is some random variable    the state  on     which determines the  true 
exchange rate f  were the currency to be allowed to float at   Then e always exceeds f 
for all        
But   also influences the exchange rate  which is to say that f  varies with   Arrange 
so that f  is strictly increasing in   So the idea is that   is some  fundamental  which 
influences the country s capacity to export or import  or to attract investment  the higher 
being   the more favorable the climate 
Now there is a bunch of speculators  of total measure   each of whom can sell one unit 
of the local currency  If they do  they pay a transactions cost t  If the government holds 
the peg  the exchange rate stays where it is  and this is the payoff to selling   t  If the 
government abandons the peg  then the speculators make a profit of e   f  so their net 
payoff is e   f    t 
What about the government s decisions  It has only one decision to make  whether to 
abandon or to retain the peg  We assume that it will abandon the peg if the measure of 
speculators exceeds a  where a is increasing in    that is  if the basic health of the economy 
is better  the government is more reluctant to abandon 
 
 
See Morris and Shin   for a very simple account of how to derive a  from a somewhat more basic starting 
point 
History Versus Expectations  
We will assume that there is some positive value of   call it 
 
  such that below 
 
  the situation 
is so bad that the government will abandon the peg anyway  In other words we are assuming 
that a      for      
 
  Then it rises but always stays less than one by assumption 
Consider  now  a second threshold for   which we ll call   this is the point above which no 
one wants to sell the currency even though she feels that the government will abandon the 
peg for sure  In other words    solves the equation 
  e   f    t    
We will assume that such a   strictly less than one  indeed exists  But we also suppose that 
there is a gap between 
 
  and   that 
 
     
 If there were no such gap  there wouldn t be a coordination problem to start with 
Now we are ready to begin our discussion of this model  First assume that the realization of 
  is perfectly observed by all agents  and that this information is common knowledge  Then 
there are obviously three cases to consider 
Case      
 
  In this case  the government will abandon the peg for sure  The economy is 
not viable  all speculators must sell  and a currency crisis occurs 
Case         In this case no speculator will attack the currency  and the peg will hold for 
sure 
Case  
 
          Obviously this is the interesting case  in which multiple equilibria obtain 
There is an equilibrium in which no one attacks  and the government maintains the peg 
There is another equilibrium in which everyone attacks and the government abandons the 
peg  This is a prototype of the so-called second-generation financial crises models  in which 
expectations   over and above fundamentals   play an important role  see Obstfeld  
 
So much for this standard model  variants of which we have already seen in excruciating 
detail  Now we drop the common knowledge of realizations  but we will maintain the 
assumption of common knowledge of the information structure that I am going to write 
down 
Suppose that   is distributed uniformly on     its value will be known perfectly at the 
time the government decides whether or not to hold the peg or to abandon it  Initially 
however  the realization of   is noisy in the following sense  each individuals sees a signal 
x which is distributed uniformly on             for some tiny        where   is the true 
realization  Conditional on the realization of   this additional noise is iid across agents 
Proposition   There is a unique value of the signal x such that an agent attacks the currency if 
x   x 
 
and does not attack if x   x 
 
 
This is an extraordinary result in the sense that a tiny amount of noise refines the equilibrium 
map considerably  Notice that as       we are practically at the common knowledge limit 
 or are we  the question of what sort of convergence is taking place is delicate and important 
here  yet there is no  zone  of multiple equilibria  The equilibrium is unique 
  History Versus Expectations 
What is central to the argument is the  infection  created by the lack of common knowledge 
 of realizations  To see this  we work through a proof of Proposition   with some informal 
discussion 
Start by looking at the point 
 
      Suppose that someone receives a signal x of this value or 
less  What is she to conclude  She doesn t know what everyone else has seen  but she does 
know that the signal is distributed around the truth with support of size   This means that 
the true realization cannot exceed 
 
  so that the government will abandon the peg for sure 
So she will sell  That is  we ve shown that for all 
x   x   
 
     
it is dominant to sell 
Now pick someone who has a signal just bigger than x  What does he conclude  Suppose 
for now  he makes the assumption that only those with signals less than x  are selling  no one 
else is  Now what is the chance   given his own signal x   that someone else has received 
a signal not exceeding x  To see this  first note that the true   must lie in  x     x     For 
each such   the chances that the signal for someone else is below x  is  x         
so the overall chances are just these probabilities integrated over all conceivable values of  
which yields  x     x     So the  infection  spreads  if x is close to x  these chances 
are close to   In this region  moreover  it is well known that the government s threshold 
is very low  close to zero sellers  and certainly well less than half the population  will cause 
an abandonment of the peg  Knowing this  such an x must sell  Knowing that all with signals 
less than x  must sell  we have deduced something stronger  that some signals above x  must create 
sales as well 
So let us proceed recursively  Suppose we have satisfied ourselves that for some index n 
everyone sells if the signal is no bigger than xn  we already know this for x  We define xn 
as the largest value of the signal for which people will want to sell  knowing that all below 
xn are selling 
This is a simple matter to work out  Fix x   xn  and imagine any      x     x     For such 
  everybody with a signal between       and xn  such an interval may be empty  of course 
will attack  by the recursive assumption  Because these are the only attackers  also by the 
recursive assumption  the government will yield iff 
 
 
 xn            
or 
     a    xn    
So we can define an implicit function h x    such that the above inequality translates into 
    h xn   
Put another way  the implicit function h x    solves the equation 
  h x       a h x      x    
History Versus Expectations  
It follows that if our person with signal x were to attack  her expected payoff would be given 
by 
   
 
Z h xn 
x 
 e   f d    t 
Now retrace the recursion starting all the way from n     we have x   
 
      Then 
 remembering that a      for all    
 
  it is easy to see that   reduces to 
 
 
Z 
 
 
x 
 e   f d    t 
For x   x  this is just 
 
 
Z 
 
 
 
 
 e   f d    t 
which is certainly strictly positive  So x  is well-defined  and x    x 
Now put x  in place of x  and repeat the process  Notice that h is increasing in x  so if we 
replace x  by x  in   then  evaluated at x   x  the payoff must turn strictly positive 
So the new x  which is the maximal signal for which people will sell under the belief that 
everyone less than x  sells  will be still higher than x  And so on  the recursion creates a 
strictly increasing sequence  xn  which converges from below to x 
 
  where x 
 
solves 
   
 
Z h x 
 
 
x 
 
 e   f d    t    
It is very easy to see that there is a unique solution to x 
  defined in this way  In fact  something 
stronger can be established 
Claim  If x 
 
is some solution to   and x 
    x 
 
  then 
   
 
Z h x 
 
 
x 
 
 e   f d    t    
To prove this  consider any x 
    x 
 
  Then two things happen  first  it is easy to see that 
h x 
 
      x 
    h x 
 
      x 
 
 
so that the support over which integration takes place in   is narrowed  Moreover  the 
stuff insidethe integral is also smaller when we move from x 
 
to x 
 
  because f  is increasing 
So the LHS of   unambiguously falls when we move from x 
 
to x 
 
  and we are done with 
the Claim 
To learn a bit more about x 
 
  use   to see that h x      x           a h x    so that 
   
 
 
Z h x 
 
 
x 
 
 e   f d    t       a h x   e  
 
 
Z h x 
 
 
x 
 
f d    t 
or 
e  
 
 
Z h x 
 
 
x 
 
f d    t   a h x   e 
 This is on the assumption that the sequence  xn  stays bounded below   This will certainly be the case  see 
below  so it s not really an assumption at all 
  History Versus Expectations 
A comnparison of this equation with   categorically shows that x 
 
is bounded below  
for small  
So there is a unique solution to x 
  and it is below   which justifies the previous recursive 
analysis  see in particular  footnote   Notice also that our analysis shows that every 
equilibrium must involve attack for signals less than x 
 
 
To complete the proof  we must show that no signal above x 
 
can ever attack  Suppose 
on the contrary  that in some equilibrium some signal above x 
  finds it profitable to attack 
Take the supremum of all signals under which it is weakly profitable to attack  call this x 
 
 
Then at x 
 
it is weakly profitable to attack  Suppose we now entertain a change in belief 
by supposing that everybody below x 
  attacks for sure  then this cannot change the weak 
profitability of attack at x 
 
  But the profit is 
 
 
Z h x 
 
 
x 
 
 e   f d    t 
which is nonnegative as we ve just argued  But this contradicts the Claim 
So we have proved that there is a unique equilibrium to the  perturbed  game  in which a 
speculative attack is carried out by an individual if and only if x   x 
 
  As       this has 
an effect of refining the equilibrium correspondence dramatically  To describe this  calculate 
the threshold x 
  as       The easiest way to do this is the  sandwich  inequality 
 e   f h x 
 
      a h x 
 
     
 
 
Z h x 
 
 
x 
 
 e   f d     e   f h x 
 
      a h x 
 
   
which is obtained by noting that f x 
        f    f h x 
 
    for all      x 
      h x 
 
    Both 
sides of the sandwich go to the same limit  because x 
  and h x 
 
      as well as the realization 
of the state   all go to a common limit  call it  
 
  This limit solves the condition 
   e   f 
 
    a 
 
    t 
It is obvious that there is a unique solution to  
Note  At this point be careful when reading Morris-Shin  There is an error in Theorem  
See Heinemann  AER   for a correction of this error which agrees with the calculations

 irrespective of sectoral membership  at any one point of time is a useful way of thinking about 
 relatively  short-run episodes such as financial crises  It may not be as useful when thinking 
about a country or region which is stuck in some low-investment trap for long periods of 
time  It is much harder to conceive of a state variable that will signal positive profitability for 
the high-investment outcome  regardless of the actions of other investors  in any one period 
In what follows  we take two approaches  one that dispenses with this sort of state variables 
altogether  Adsera and Ray   this section  and one that resurrects state variables  but

Figure   A Depiction of Sectors A and B 
has them follow a Markov process  possibly with small local support  over time  Frankel 
and Pauzner   next section 
Suppose that an economy has two regions  A and B  A total capital  or labor  endowment 
of K  is split at date   between the two regions  Denote by K the capital in region B  so that 
K    K is the capital stock in region A  Capital invested in Region A yields a fixed rate of 
return  normalized to zero  Region B s rate of return r is taken to depend positively on its 
capital endowment 
  r   f K 
where f is continuous  strictly increasing  and f        f K 
Imagine that there is a continuum of agents  and each agent owns a single unit of capital 
Capital is free to move between regions but each relocation entails a nonnegative cost 
This model may be conveniently summarized by using a simple diagram 
Figure   shows us the two sectors  In A the rate of return is flat at the  normalized  level 
zero  In B  the return to any one individual to participating in a sector depends positively 
on the number of individuals already active in that sector  starting below zero and ending 
above  To complete the description  we locate the initial allocation of individuals across the 
two sectors  given by history  This is given by OA people in A and OB people in B  You 
could think of the line segment AB as the total number of people in the economy  as the 
allocation of people changes  the only thing that alters is the position of AB but not its length 
Now  the initial allocation of people has been chosen to deliberately illustrate a point  Even 
though B is  in principle   better  than A  if everyone were in B the rate of return would 
  History Versus Expectations 
exceed that of A  at the starting location  the actual rate of return in A exceeds the actual rate 
of return in B 
Note that our examples discussed so far fit in quite neatly into this framework  For instance 
the return in B could be interpreted as the wages paid to people who have decided to acquire 
a certain set of skills  as a function of the number of individuals who have already acquired such 
skills  In this interpretation  if you were to think of the alternative occupation as conferring 
no externalities  you might imagine that the rate-of-return line in A as nearly flat  while the 
one in B slopes upwards  Or you could think of B as typewriters with the Dvorak system 
or for that matter as alternative chip designs  while A contains the QWERTY typewriters 
or Intel chips  The rate of return is then to be interpreted as the total amount of satisfaction 
accruing to a consumer or user  net of the cost of purchase or usage  In all these examples 
it might be useful to think of OA as a large segment  while OB is very small  perhaps zero 
Now we are ready to make this model run  Imagine that  as indicated in Figure   the rate 
of return in A exceeds the corresponding rate in B  Then  as time passes  individuals will 
gravitate from B to A  This describes the failure of of an exciting new sector when there is 
enough critical mass to keep the momentum going  Matters will end with everybody in A 
and nobody in B 
Figure   also reveals that if there had been sufficient critical mass  matters could have been 
entirely different  For instance  suppose that initial history initially put us at the allocation 
OA  and OB 
  where the rates of returns in the two sectors are exactly equal  Then the 
slightest additional tilt towards B can spark off an accelerating tempo of beneficial change 
as people switch over to the new technology  or the new product  or a new way of life 
Now here is a different story that works entirely on the basis of expectations  Begin again in 
the situation where OA individuals are in A  while the rest  OB  are in B  Now imagine that 
for some reason  everybody believes that everybody else will be in B tomorrow  Never mind 
where this belief came from  Simply note that if this belief is genuinely held by someone  he 
must also believe that B is the sector to be in  because the return there is higher  Consequently 
he will gravitate to B tomorrow  But if everybody thinks the same way  everybody will be 
in B  and the seemingly absurd belief is completely justified  provided that the one-time 
cost of moving is not too high  of course  Thus  it would seem from this argument that 
history plays no role at all  Irrespective of initial conditions  there are only two self-justifying 
outcomes that are possible  everyone in A or everyone in B  and that both these outcomes are 
always possible  depending only on expectations  How do we square this story with the 
one that we described earlier 
To analyze this  we enrich both the switching cost specification as well as the intertemporal 
structure of the externality 
In all that follows  regard K as the amount of capital in Sector B  so that K    K is the amount 
of capital in Sector A  Assume that the cost of moving from B to A is given by a function 
c A K  and that the cost of moving from A to B is given by some function c B K  Say that 
either of these cost functions exhibits congestion if it increases  at least over some interval  in 
 There is also a third outcome in which the rates of return in the two sector are exactly equalized  but it is 
possible to rule this out on grounds of  stability 
History Versus Expectations  
the capital in the relevant sector  That is  c A exhibits congestion if it is decreasing over some 
range  while c B does so if it is increasing over some range 
Before we describe agent behavior  let us track the relevant prices  Let      r t  cA t  cB t 
 
t 
be some point expectation about the path  measurable in time  of returns and relocation costs 
in each region  Future returns are discounted in the standard way  using a discount rate  
Denote by V  i  t  the optimal value to an agent in region i  i   A  B  beginning at time t  when 
the commonly anticipated path of returns is   Then by standard dynamic programming 
arguments  an agent in region i will switch sectors at time t if V  i  t    V  j  t    cj t  will 
stay if the opposite inequality holds  and will be indifferent if equality holds 
A path   is an equilibrium if it is generated by the optimal decisions of  almost  all agents in 
response to  
To discuss the generation of   consider now some exogenously given measurable path 
 K t 
 
t 
 recall the interpretation that K t  is the amount of capital in sector B  We assume 
that there is some lag  however small  in the speed at which external effects induced by 
incoming outgoing factors affect the going rates of return  From this point of view  we 
regard the return function f K  as representing a  long run level  of the rate of return  once 
the economy has settled at a certain level of capital K  We assume that at date   r  is 
precisely f K   see   Thereafter  we introduce an increasing function g  with g     
such that 
  r t    g f K t    r t 
Thus  the rate of return at any date  chases  the  appropriate  rate of return corresponding 
to the division of the capital endowment at that date  The specific functional form of g 
determines the speed at which returns adjust  In any case  capital owners will get paid r t 
at date t 
Thus a path of capital allocations  K t  generates a path of returns  r t  using   and a 
path  cA t  cB t  using the relationships cB t    c B K t  and cA t    c A K    K t  for all t 
Several economic situations conform quite naturally to this specification  In models of 
search or matching  the productivity of some fixed amount of capital may depend on the 
ability of that capital to find partners  with more capital  say  because of minimum scale 
requirements in production  This ability  in turn  will depend on the total amount of capital 
in the economy  see  e g  Diamond   Note that a discontinuous jump in the capital 
stock will lead to a smooth intertemporal increase in productivity as long as the process 
of  matching partners  takes place in continuous time  Likewise  if one replaces  capital 
by  population  and  rate of return  by  utility  the concentration of population in a 
particular geographical region may provoke large amounts of productive activity and a 
variety of goods and services  attracting still more people because of the greater utility to be 
had  Krugman  b  Again  the degree of productive activity might react smoothly to 
 Note that we do not a priori restrict  K t  to be a continuous path  so that self-fulfilling  jumps  are  in principle 
permitted 
  History Versus Expectations 
a sudden influx of population  perhaps because the information regarding a larger market 
needs time to permeate to all the producers 
Say that an intertemporal equilibrium is exclusively history dependent if the long-run outcome 
either equals the initial allocation  or entails migration only to the sector that is initially 
profitable  Note that myopic tatonnement has the same properties  though obviously the 
exact path may be different  The main similarity is that no room is left for farsighted 
expectations 
Proposition   Assume f K      Unless the cost of relocation exhibits congestion  every 
equilibrium must be exclusively history dependent  irrespective of the discount rate 
This observation is independent of the magnitude of discounting  and of the degree of 
responsiveness of returns  as long as it is not instantaneous  Thus by a minor and reasonable 
weakening of one of the assumptions in the literature  we obtain a class of models where 
expectations are dwarfed by history  where initial conditions determine the final equilibrium 
Of course  if rates of return adjust instantaneously  then expectations-driven equilibria are 
possible 
We reiterate  our claim is not that ahistorical equilibria are impossible  But that  in this 
class of models  in addition to the intersectoral agglomeration externalities  the  migration 
technology  is crucial to understand the sources of such equilibria  The only way in which 
such outcomes can occur is by introducing a cost to postponement  i e  by making future 
relocation costs increase in the stock of settlers in our case 
Proof of Proposition   Consider the case in which f K      The case f K      can 
be settled by a parallel argument 
Fix any equilibrium   We claim that K t    K s  for all t   s  which settles exclusive 
history-dependence 
Suppose this is false  Then  indeed  there is some t and s with t   s  and exhibiting the 
following features 
a  K t    K s 
b  r      for all      s  t 
c  Some agent moves to sector B at date s 
d  The moving agent does not return to A until after date t 
Part  a  is simply the negation of our proposition  Part  b  follows from the fact that returns 
adjust continuously  and that r      Part  c  follows from the fact that K cannot begin to 
climb unless there is movement from A to B  And Part  d  follows from Part  b  there is no 
point in someone going to B and coming back while the returns there are strictly negative 
throughout 
Now consider our moving agent at date s and have her move at date t instead  following 
thereafter her original optimal strategy  by  d  this is possible  Then her deviation return 
History Versus Expectations  
discounted by   to date s  is given by 
  e

where the first inequality follows from Part  b  the third from discounting  and the last from 
the no-congestion assumption 
But together    and   yield a contradiction 
  State Variables and Time 
We now resurrect state variables but in a way that concentrates on the possibly long-term 
nature of the coordination problem  as in Adsera-Ray and in contrast to Morris-Shin   The  
material here is based on Frankel and Pauzner   As in the previous sections  we 
assume that in every period there is a coordination game to be played  However  we will 
take the return in Sector B to depend  not just on the amount of K in that sector  but also on 
some exogenous state variable zt 
  Thus we write f K  z  for the return in that sector  while 
the return in sector A is normalized to zero just as before  Without loss of any generality 
assume that f is increasing in z  the realization of the random variable zt at date t 
The idea is that zt 
is some random variable which is changing over time and is exogenous 
to the model at hand  For example  it could be the price of oil  which makes the industrial 
sector B relatively less or more attractive than the agricultural sector A 
The first main assumption on z is that it follows some nondegenerate stochastic process with 
no trend  So the increments to z all look the same  no matter what the starting level  The 
second assumption is a joint one on f and z  there are values of z  in its overall support 
which you can think of as the entire real line  so that it pays for everyone to be in Sector B 
today no matter what happens in the future  and no matter how many people are in Sector 
B today  Likewise  there are values of z so low that the opposite is true  it is worth being in 
Sector A today no matter what happens in the future 
Like the previous model  this one is easier to do in continuous time  Let   be the discount 
factor of the agents  The former assumption can be formally expressed as 
  E 
 Z  
t 
e

f  zt z    z 
 
   
for some z  in the support of the random variable  The latter assumption can be expressed as

for some 
 
z in the support of the random variable 
Notice that this model emphatically does not rule out the multiple equilibrium problem  The 
assumptions embodied in   and   only rule out the problem for extreme and possibly 
very low-probability values that zt might take on at some later date  For  most  intermediate 
values of z  there should be a genuine coordination problem as before  my behavior will 
depend  in principle  on what I anticipate others to do  now and in the future 
To describe behavior a bit more clearly  let us specify the model a bit further  We shall 
suppose that there is no cost of moving  but that everybody gets the chance to move at 
some point according to a Poisson process with independent arrivals  Thus each person is 
arbitrarily and randomly given the chance to move  she may not exercise this right  however 
The remainder are stuck in whichever sector they may happen to be in that instant  All 
moves are made under the asumption of rational expectations and full intertemporal utility 
maximization  just as in the previous model 
Proposition   In the infinite-horizon moving game  there is a function  k z  such that everyone 
who has a chance to move at any date  chooses sector B when k    k z  chooses Sector A when k    k z 
and is indifferent when k    k z  The specific nature of the function  k will depend on the data of the 
problem 
The proposition states that despite the potential scope for multiple equilibria  history once 
again fully pins down the outcome  but in a completely different way from the previous 
exercise  The extreme values that z can conceivably assume somehow serve to pin down 
behavior in the intermediate  more likely  zone 
Understanding this proposition teaches us something subtle about the role of beliefs in 
equilibrium models  so it is worthwhile to go through the details  To emphasize the 
nontriviality of this proposition  it may be worth considering   just for a moment  
the case in which z does not change at all over time  see Figure   This sort of diagram will 
be repeated more than once so let us get used to it  On the horizontal axis are various values 
of z  in particular  the threshold values of z  and 
 
z are clearly marked  On the vertical axis 
are different values of the capital stock in Sector B  The maximum such value is obviously 
K  this is marked as well 
You are to interpret both these values as current values   Of course  this injunction is irrelevant 
for z at the moment because its value is fixed  but it will become relevant later 
The diagram also contains two downward-sloping lines  The first of these lines   call it 
line I   depicts the combinations of  K  z  values such that if Sector B starts with K  and then 
gains capital whenever people get a chance to move  the present discounted value of sector B 
is zero  Formally  this first line is the collection of all  K  z  pairs such that

move  starting from K

Figure   Boundaries for Multiple Equilibria when z is Fixed 
Notice that as z goes up  this makes returns better for Sector B  so that the threshold value 
of K needed to sstisfy the condition goes down  This is why the line is downward-sloping 
The second line   call it line II   describes the combinations of  K  z  values such that if 
Sector B starts with K  and then loses capital whenever people get a chance to move  the 
present discounted value of sector B is zero  Formally  this first line is the collection of all 
 K  z  pairs such that

where  K 
 
t 
  is the process in which people move to sector A whenever they have a chance to 
move  starting from K 
Line II is downward-sloping for the same reason that line I is  In addition  it should be 
obvious that line II must lie to the right of line I  as it imposes zero profits for Sector B on the 
basis of more pessimistic expectations about that sector 
Now notice that lines I and II mark out demarcations for unique and multiple equilibria  If 
the system finds itself to the right of line II  everybody must move to B when they get the 
chance  Likewise  if the system finds itself to the left of line I  everyone must move to A 
when they get the chance  But between lines I and II the situation is up for grabs  Because 
such a configuration is to the left of line II  it is possible to speculate that if everyone flees 
for Sector A  then a particular agent must too  when she gets the chance to move  This is 
self-fulfilling  Similarly  because the configuration is to the right of line I  one can sustain the 
opposite movement in this zone  Multiple equilibria are not ubiquitous  for extreme values 
of z there is only one equilibrium  but they haven t vanished  not by a long shot

Figure   Recursive Construction of the Locus k 
 
 z 
So much for the case in which the value of z is exogenously given  Now let s suppose that z 
follows a Markov process as described above  Figure   starts this analysis by drawing the 
analogue of line II  the one with pessimistic expectations from the point of view of Sector 
B  I say  analogue  because the earlier description took z to be given  now we have to 
take expectations over changes in z as well  Formally  we look at all pairs of points  k  z   
forming the locus k z      such that

where Kt 
is the  pessimistic process  in which individuals move to A whenever they get the 
chance  and zt 
is the exogenous stochastic process starting from z    z 
The locus k z    is the analogue of line II  and it is downward-sloping for exactly the same 
reason  But now matters get interesting just to the left of this locus  The pessimistic 
expectation  can it be validated  It can if z is fixed  but now it is possible that tomorrow 
z might increase  taking the whole system into the area right of k z    In that case we 
know that whoever gets a chance to move will not move to A  So expectations that are fully 
pessimistic are inconsistent with what we already know about the model  at least with some 
probability  Let us modify  then  our process K to say that it pessimistically moves down 
 as before  except under the above contingency  But now this makes Sector B a bit more 
attractive than it was when constructing the locus k z    It follows that the new zero-payoff 
locus associated with these somewhat brighter expectations   call it k z      must be to the 
left of k z     see Figure  
This starts an iteration  Even k z    must be too pessimistic  because the prospects of moving 
to B are brighter than those described by k z    In general  define k z  n     to be the locus

Figure   Recursive Construction of the Locus k z 
of all  k  z  points which make people indifferent between Sectors A and B  assuming that 
whenever the system is to the right of k z  n  people will move to B  and will move to A otherwise 
 Because z has a density  we don t have to worry about what happens if we land right on 
k z  n  All these loci are downward-sloping  and they converge to some limit which we 
shall call k 
 
 z  This limit locus has the following properties 
  If the system is to the right of this locus  everyone who has a chance to move at that point 
must move to Sector B 
  If the system is to the left of this locus  matters are ambiguous  Certainly  if everyone 
is expected to go to A whenever the system is to the left of k 
 
 z  then they will do so  But 
there is no ruling out multiple equilibria yet  It may be that points to the left of k 
 
 z  are also 
consistent with a move to B 
So we need to continue the analysis  and to do so we start an iteration from the left this time 
The iteration is not going to be entirely symmetric  so pay attention to what follows 
First  we translate the locus k z    way over to the left  Figure   illustrates  By our 
assumption on extreme values  I can find  in fact  a translate that is so far over that for every 
 k  z  on that  translated  locus

where Kt 
is now the  optimistic process  in which individuals move to B whenever they get 
the chance  and zt 
is the exogenous stochastic process starting from z    z  That is  these 
values of z are so bad for sector B that despite the harbouring of optimistic expectations 
  History Versus Expectations 
about future moves to Sector B  it is best to stay in Sector A  In this way  we have identified 
a sufficient condition for moves to Sector A to always constitute an equilibrium  that  k  z  be 
to the left of this translated locus  call it k 
 
 z   
But now  once again  we know that these optimistic predictions are too optimistic  People 
won t always move to B  in fact  as we have just seen  if the state moves into the extreme 
left zone that we have just identified  they will move to A  or stay there  as the case may 
be  Thus we can define a fresh collection of  k  z  with the property that starting from each 
of these points and entertaining the optimistic expectation except when the state wanders to 
the left of k 
 
 z    state A is weakly better  Figure   shows the boundary of this set as a 
dotted line to the right of k 
 
 z   
Now iterate as follows  translate the locus k 
 
 z      to the right this time   as far as possible 
subject to the condition that no part of it wander out of the dotted line  see Figure   to 
follow this fully  This translation we will call k 
 
 z    More generally  continue the iteration 
as follows  given k 
 
 z  n  consider the collection of all  k  z  points which make people weakly 
prefer Sector A to B  assuming that whenever the system is to the right of k 
 z  n  people will move to 
B  and will move to A otherwise  Having done so  define k 
 
 z  n     to be the furthest translate 
of k 
 
 z  n  subject to the constraint that it fully lies within the set of points defined in the 
previous sentence  Let k z  denote the limit of this recursion 
Appreciate again that this iteration is different from the first one  It has a similar flavor  but 
we only restrict ourselves to translates  Nevertheless  we can certainly say that for all points 
to the left of k z  it is a dominant strategy to move to sector A  after all  we have been   if 
anything    conservative  towards A when performing this iteration 
Now we need to look at points on the locus a bit more carefully  Notice that the first limit  
k 
 
 z    certainly has the property that on k 
 z  one is indifferent between A and B   provided 
we assume everyone moves to B on the right of this locus  and towards A on the left of this 
locus  But because we have thrown away some points in doing the second iteration  we 
cannot say the same of k z  All we can say is that if we assume everyone moves to B on the 
right of k z  and towards A on the left of k z  then on the locus people weakly prefer A to 
B 
But we can go one step further  there must be some point on k z  at which individuals must be 
indifferent between A and B  provided we assume everyone moves to B on the right of this 
locus  and towards A on the left of this locus  The reason is the nature of our iteration  at 
each stage we chose the maximal translation to the right that is possible  If strict preference 
for A held at all points on k z  the iteration could not have ended at that stage 
Call this point of indifference   Now go back to the locus k 
 
 z  and pick its  twin point   
 see Figure   That there is a twin point  at eactly the same vertical height  follows from 
the fact that the loci k 
 
 z  and k z  are translates of each other 
Our final claim is that   and   must coincide  To see this  recap the following two points 
 This is a crucial technical point in the proof and establishing it formally needs a bit of care  though the intuition 
is very clear

assuming that everybody  who can  will choose A to the left of the locus k 
 
 z  and everybody 
will choose B to the right of that locus 
Now recall that z has no trend  But then statements  i  and  ii  must be incompatible if we 
insist that   and   are distinct  To see this  simply couple together the events at   and  
and thereafter  For every path starting from   there is a twin path starting from   forever 
separated by the same distance in z  And the two share exactly the same probability measure 
But the expectation of returns over the first set of paths is zero  Therefore the expectation 
of returns over the second set of paths must be positive  because f is increasing in z  This 
proves that   and   cannot be distinct 
But then the entire functions k 
 
 z  and k z  must coincide  Call this common function  k z 
We have proved the proposition  It must be that to the left of  k z  everyone moves to A 
while to its right everyone moves to B  Multiple equilibria have been eliminated 
 
CHAPTER  
History-Dependence  An Introduction 
  An Overview 
To summarize what we have studied so far  we ve looked at multiple equilibrium models 
in which there are  good  and  bad  equilibria  often Pareto-ranked  The presence of such 
multiplicities has often been put forward as an explanation for underdevelopment  Ot at 
least  even if it cannot serve as an explanation  it does succeed in pointing out why entirely 
different levels of economic outcomes are consistent with the same underlying fundamentals 
As we have seen  the potential difficulty with the multiple-equilibrium explanation is that 
we have no theory of how one equilibrium or the other comes about  Indeed  if we run such 
models in real time  there is no particular reason why the economic system cannot  jump 
from one equilibrium to another  such jumps helped along by acts of coordination among 
the population  At the same time we know that such jumps make no intuitive sense  An 
economy locked into many years of one bad equilibrium is not likely to change overnight 
 or at any rate  overnight on any one particular night  We have looked at three different 
theoretical frameworks that attempt to come to grips with this  The first takes seriously the 
common-knowledge presumptions that underlie these models and shows that a departure 
from such presumptions can often pin down unique equilibria  typically mediated by some 
public signal  The second approach studies lagged external effects  The third approach 
returns to public signals in a dynamic context to precipitate a unique equilibrium 
What s nice about these models is that they will typically generate rapid transitions from 
one equilibrium to another  What these models say that we will observe are long periods 
spent in a particular equilibrium  and then a series of events that suddenly hurl the economy 
into an entirely different configuration  Many social and economic transformations do have 
this  logistic  feature 
In what follows  we take a very different   and complementary   path  Now the state 
variable will get center stage and we will push multiple equilibrium into the background 
Indeed  we will consider models in which at every date  and for each going value of the 
state variable  there will be a unique outcome  But the dynamics of the system will allow for 
multiple steady states  Multiple steady states are therefore not to be confused with multiple 
  History-Dependence  An Introduction 
equilibrium  There will typically be just one for every initial condition  But different initial 
conditions will often map into different steady states 
There are many different state variables that we can study  Each of them is important enough 
to have a book written on them  First begin with economics 
  The capital stock is  of course  the most common example of a  state  in development 
economics  It is the central variable of growth theory  Section   below tells you a little 
bit about the Romer model  in which the initial capital stock can have long-term effects on 
economic growth  unlike in the convergence models 
  Infrastructure represents a special case of item   but an extremely important special 
case that has yet to be studied carefully in the context of history-dependence 
  Likewise  it would be of great use to have economic theories of culture and corruption 
which then feed back into economic progress  or the lack thereof  Not that models of 
economics and culture don t exist  but once again there is not that much that fits the historydependence 
framework that I emphasize here 
  Poor societies have legal systems that are limited  if not in terms of laws on the books 
then in terms of actual enforcement of those laws  The same is true of contract enforcement 
Limited enforcement of contracts and laws then feed back on the economic system 
  Economic inequality  this will be the one topic that we discuss in great detail below  But 
stay tuned for future editions in which I plan to take up all the other themes one by one 
Then there is politics 
  Elites that deny power and therefore cripple subsequent growth 
  Historical inequalities in  say  the distribution of land that distorts and limits political 
participation to demands for redistribution rather than for growth-enhacing investments 
  the poverty-conflict-poverty cycle  about which we shall have something to say in these

  Introductory Notes on Economic Inequality 
We now turn to a particular   but important   state variable  the disparity in the historical 
distribution of assets  or economic inequality  To be sure  inequality is a concept that is of 
intrinsic interest  and there is a large literature that has attempted to axiomatize measures 
of inequality so that one can keep track of changing income or wealth distributions from a 
purely ethical perspective  But there is also the functional aspect of inequality  the interaction 
between inequality and other variables of significance in the economy  such as aggregate 
output  efficiency  unemployment  and so on  These interactions may take place  within the 
period  so that they are analyzable using a static model  or they be dynamic  in which case 
we must use intertemporal models that keep track   among other things   of accumulation 
decisions 
History-Dependence  An Introduction  
Why does inequality matter  not intrinsically  which is a question of ethics  but functionally 
There are several answers to this question 
  Inequality matters because it affects productive potential  The cleanest parable of this has 
come to be known as the nutrition-based efficiency wage hypothesis  In poor societies 
wages affect food consumption  and food consumption affects the ability to work  This will 
lead to an equilibrium in which the distribution of asset ownership will have economy-wide 
effects 
  Inequality matters because it affects the ability of individuals to gain access to productive resources 
As long as the distribution of productive ideas or new projects is loosely correlated with the 
distribution of wealth  there will be people who have ideas  and abilities  but do not have 
access to the wealth needed to put those ideas into real outcomes  This sort of argument 
hinges on a missing or imperfect market for capital 
  Inequality matters because it affects incentives  There are various aspects of this problem and 
we shall address some of them  For instance  what is the connection between an egalitarian 
society and incentives  What is the connection between egalitarianism and the extent of 
collective action 
 Inequality matters for  political-economy  reasons  Under this catch-all are a number of effects 
that may be discussed  Inequality may affect voting behavior  leading to different degrees 
of redistribution and consequently affecting the incentives to accumulate capital  Inequality 
may create social conflict and in this way be related to low output  Finally  inequality  within 
an organization  may create efficiency losses  because individuals at different wealth levels 
may effectively have different objectives 
  Inequality matters because it prevents correct resource allocation on the part of the government 
That is  high inequality may affect the ability of individuals to transmit information 
accurately to a policy-maker 
We begin with dynamic models that track the evolution of inequality over generations  The 
emphasis will be on items   and   discussed above 
  A Special Note on Capital Stocks 
We now begin our transition to a more serious assessment of initial conditions  Unlike the 
more abstract role for history postulated in repeated coordination games  these considerations 
arise from full-fledged dynamic models in which state variables play a fundamental 
role 
I provide a preliminary illustration of this using a variant of a growth model due to Romer 
  In this model  multiplicity of equilibrium paths can exist from the same initial 
condition  but the initial conditions play a fundamental role as well 
  History-Dependence  An Introduction 
Suppose that output is produced at each date t according to the equation 
  yt   F 
 
kt 
 
 kt 
 
 
where  k is the average economy-wide stock of capital  introduced to express the social 
externalities from capital  or the knowledge embodied in capital  The idea is that greater 
capital in the society at large has positive spillovers for any one producer  In the sequel we 
will take kt    kt for all t  but no one individual internalizes this connection in his decisionmaking 
Produced output is divided among consumption and investment as follows 
  yt   ct   atkt 
 
where c represents consumption and ak represents the amount of net investment in the 
production of new capital  The fact that we express new investment as a fraction a of the 
existing capital stock is simply a matter of convenience 
Investment creates growth in the capital stock  We postulate that 
  kt    kt 
kt 
  G at 
so that the rate of growth of the capital stock depends on the  intensity  of investment  on 
the investment-capital ratio a 
The objective function takes the familiar form 
  maxX 
t 
 
tu ct 
where   the discount factor lies between   and   and u is a one-period utility function 
The following assumptions will be in force 
 U  The utility function u is increasing  continuous and strictly concave on R 
 G  The function G a  is continuous  increasing and concave  with G      and sup G a   
B    
 F  The production function F is continuous  nondecreasing  and increasing and concave in 
its first argument  However  when private and social capital move together  we assume that 
the  private  marginal product of capital is nondecreasing  that is  F k  k  is nondecreasing 
in k 
Also restrict the discount factor   to ensure that the infinite sum of utilities is always welldefined 
I omit the details here 
Fix some initial stock k and a path of  social capital  stocks  z    kt  with  k    k  Notice 
that a program  for some individual  can simply be identified with the  private  sequence 
z    kt   everything else can be recovered from it Say that such a program z is optimal from k 
History-Dependence  An Introduction  
under z  if it maximizes utility  see   in the class of all feasible programs  Finally  z is an 
equilibrium program if it is optimal from k under z itself 
Using fixed point arguments  it is possible to prove that an equilibrium exists  But of course 
there may be many of them  and this comes from exactly the same considerations that we 
have seen earlier in these notes  The fact that an increase in social capital increases private 
marginal product means that a complementarity is at work here   higher investments in 
the economy as a whole may be self-fulfilling  The point of this section  however  is not to 
emphasize the multiplicity but to see how an initial state  proxied in this instance by the 
capital stock    or history   can determine the set of equilibrium paths 
To this end  define an equilibrium program from k to be stationary if kt   k for all t  We may 
now state 
Proposition   There exists an equilibrium program from k which is stationary if and only if 
  F k  k G 
 
     
     
Proof  Necessity  Here is an outline which can easily be made fully rigorous  The idea is that 
if an equilibrium program is stationary  then a tiny sacrifice of consumption today in return 
for a larger stationary stream of output in the future is not worth it  Let s suppose that the 
tiny sacrifice of consumption is   Then the current loss is approximately u 
 c  What is the 
future gain  The extra capital stock produced is approximately G 
  and consequently the 
extra stream of output available from tomorrow is approximately F k  k G 
 
  If this is all 
consumed  then the extra stream of utility from tomorrow is approximately u 
 c F k  k G 
 
 
Calculate the present value of this extra stream of gains  Our program is an equilibrium 
 and therefore an optimum from k under itself  so this deviation should not be worth it 
This yields  
Sufficiency  Suppose that expectations of social capital are stationary at  kt   k for all t  We 
want to show that the stationary program is optimal under these expectations  starting from 
k  let c be the consumption under the stationary program and let  kt  be any other program 
 feasible from k under stationary expectations  with associated consumption sequence  ct

which completes the proof 
Proposition   shows us that stationary equilibria exist under certain conditions  and 
moreover  that they cannot exist unless those conditions are met  Notice that the condition 
  combines technological parameters  the discount factor  and the initial capital stock in a 
specific way  If you combine this restriction with our assumption that F k  k      we see 
that at certain low levels of the capital stock  it is possible to stagnate forever 
The role of the initial capital stock is made even sharper in the next proposition  which 
tells us that if   is not met   that is  if the initial capital stock is large enough   then 
equilibrium programs must exhibit sustained growth 
Proposition   If 
  F k  k G 
 
         
then every equilibrium program must exhibit kt    
Proof  Notice that  kt  must be a nondecreasing sequence  Suppose  contrary to our claim 
that kt    k     as t     Consider the sequence of programs  k 
n 
t 
  given by k 
n 
t 
  k t   n  for 
each n and t  Note that the nth sequence has as its starting stock kn  and that for each n  the 
program is an equilibrium from kn  By a standard maximum-theorem-style argument that 
History-Dependence  An Introduction  
we do not include here  the pointwise limit of these programs also represents an equilibrium 
But the limit is the stationary sequence  
 kt  given by  kt    k for all t  By Proposition    
F 
 k 
 k G 
 
     
     
But  k   k  the original initial stock  and given that k fails   and F k  k  is nondecreasing  we 
have a contradiction 
Thus in the Romer model  if the initial capital stock is large enough  equilibrium programs 
must grow  No self-fulfilling expectational argument can create stagnation  However  if 
the initial capital stock is low  an expectations trap is possible  In this way history and 
expectations interact 
In case you have not noticed this already  notice that Propositions   and   are different in 
one significant respect  Proposition   rules out stagnation  while Proposition   says that 
stagnation is one possible outcome  but does not rule out growth  So there is a role here for 
expectations  despite the influence of history  With more work  one can show that there is an 
even lower  positive  value of the capital stock from which no growth can ever occur  and in 
the remaining  intermediate  zone there are multiple equilibria involving both stagnation 
 as we ve already seen  and sustained growth  depending on expectations 
 
CHAPTER  
The Dynamics of Inequality 
  A Introductory Framework 
Every dynamic model of growth and distribution will exhibit some form of the following 
equations at the level of the individual unit  person  household  region  country  Think 
of time as being divided into discrete periods and adopt the view that each period is the 
length of an entire generation  So individuals indexed by different dates belong to different 
generations  The first equation is just budget balance 
  yt   ct   xt 
 
where y is the lifetime income or wealth of an individual in generation t  c is her consumption 
and x is the bequest she leaves to the next generation 
The next equation describes how bequests translate into lifetime income for the next 
generation 
  yt    f xt 
where f is some production function  Such production functions have different interpretations 
depending on the context 
  It may just be a standard production function as used in the theory of growth  say of the 
Cobb-Douglas form 
  If the individual is part of a competitive economy everyone could earn a wage rate w and 
then get a return of     r on bequests  so that 
f x    w       r x 
  The  production function  may simply represent returns to different  occupations  For 
instance  suppose that it costs nothing to keep your child unskilled but costs x  to turn her 
into a skilled laborer  then 
f x   
 
w for x   x 
  w  for x   x 
  The Dynamics of Inequality 
in this case the production function will be exogenous to an individual dynasty but may 
well be endogenous from the point of view of the economy as a whole  because the wages 
for skilled and unskilled labor will be determined in equilibrium  These represent the sort 
of interactive models that will occupy a lot of our attention 
The last ingredient has to do with preferences  There are four notions that appear in the 
literature 
WG  Warm Glow  Generation t has a utility function given by U ct 
  xt  See  e g  Banerjee 
and Newman  
CB  Consumption-Based  Generation t has a utility function given by U ct 
  ct  See  e g 
Arrow   Bernheim and Ray  
IB  Income-Based  Generation t has a utility function given by U ct 
  yt  See  e g  Becker and 
Tomes    
NP  NonPaternalistic  Generation t has a utility function given by U ct 
  Vt  where Vt  is 
the lifetime utility of generation t     See  e g  Barro   and Loury  
Notice that WG starts to look really problematic in those cases in which the production 
function is endogenous  as in the case of occupational choice  It is hard to cling to 
some exogenous utility function that is based on bequests when what those bequests are 
accomplishing is endogenous to the system  Thus  while WG and IP are equivalent when f 
is exogenous  WG is not really something we will be looking at seriously 
What about CB versus IB  I prefer the latter for two reasons 
First  I should be getting a utility out of my child s  capability  measured here by lifetime 
income or wealth  Just what she does with it   how much she consumes  how much she gives 
away   should not really be my concern  That said  we might sometimes see paternalistic 
parents who care more about the child s consumption rather than the resources that she has 
access to  I m not saying this is a logical rebuttal of CB 
Second  a model based on CB is typically hard  There are all sorts of game-theoretic subtleties 
involved here  see Kohlberg   and Bernheim and Ray   It does not seem sensible 
to bring in all those subtleties and still try to address the different questions of inequality 
and development that we are more interested in here 
That said  however  why not go the whole hog and choose NP over IB  After all  NB is 
completely nonpaternalistic  parents only care about the utility of their children  not the 
bequests they leave them  or how much they consume  or indeed how much they earn 
There is some sense in this view and we will try and incorporate it in what follows  But it 
has to be realized that the value-function approach can be conceptually problematic  It is well 
known that NP is equivalent to the maximization of a utility function defined on an infinite 
generational stream of consumptions  Do we really internalize that much  Do parents really 
calculate future utilities  or do they use the  capability measure    income wealth   as a 
convenienet shorthand 
The Dynamics of Inequality  
There is another reason   but more on this later   why NP may not be the correct 
specification 
In any case  even at this level of abstraction  we can glean a few general principles  The most 
important of these   at least for the aggregative models that we consider   is the principle 
of monotonicity  The easiest way to see this is to suppose that a generation has the utility 
function 
E U c   k   
where c is its consumption  k is its investment    is some random shock  and  k    is some 
mapping  If it is the identity mapping  then  k      k and this is like warm-glow  But 
  could also represent next-period s consumption  or income  or utility  For now let us 
not worry about the endogeneity of these mappings  we will do that when we get to the 
equilibrium analysis 
Assume that 
 U  The utility function U is differentiable and strictly concave in c  and exhibits complementarities 
between c and   U c       
Renark  Obviously U is not an ordinal property and all of the above can be written as a 
suitable supermodularity condition  However  condition  U  is fine enough for what we 
want to do 
Proposition   Assume  U  and suppose that   is nondecreasing in k  Let h be the policy 
correspondence that describes the optimal choice of k for each y  subject to the constraint that c   y k 
Then if y   y 
 
  k   h y  and k    h y 
 
  it must be the case that k   k 
 
 
Proof  Suppose this assertion is false for some  y  y 
 
  k  k 
 
  as described in the statement 
of the proposition  Then k 
    k  Notice that k 
 
is feasible for y  because it is feasible under y 
 
 
which is smaller  while k is feasible under y 
 
 because k 
 
  which is bigger  is feasible under 
y 
 
  It follows from optimality that 
EU y   k   k      EU y   k 
 
   k 
 
   
while 
EU y 
    k 
 
   k 
 
      EU y 
    k   k   
Adding these two inequalities and transposing terms  we see that 
EU y   k   k      EU y 
    k   k      EU y   k 
 
   k 
 
      EU y 
    k 
 
   k 
 
   
Now use the assumption that   is nondecreasing in k  plus the complementarities condition 
to conclude that 
EU y   k 
 
   k 
 
      EU y 
    k 
 
   k 
 
      EU y   k 
 
   k      EU y 
    k 
 
   k   
Combine these last two inequalities to obtain that 
EU y   k   k      EU y 
    k   k      EU y   k 
 
   k      EU y 
    k 
 
   k   
and now draw yourself a diagram to see that the strict concavity of U in c is violated by this 
last inequality 
  The Dynamics of Inequality 
This proposition yields the following corollary when there is no uncertainty 
Proposition   Suppose that there is no uncertainty  that the production function is increasing 
in k  and that the optimization problem above is solved repeatedly by successive generations starting 
from some initial y  Then the resulting paths of yt and kt must be monotonic in time 
Proof  Suppose not  Then two cases are possible 
Case   There exist dates t and s with s   t     such that yt   yt  yt            ys 
  and 
ys    ys 
 
Case   There exist dates t and s with s   t     such that yt   yt  yt            ys 
  and 
ys    ys 
 
It is easy to see that one of these two cases must occur if the proposition is false  We now 
obtain a contradiction in Case   the same argument holds for Case  
In Case   we have yt    ys  it follows from f increasing that kt   ks 
  However yt   ys 
 
This contradicts Proposition  
  Inequality and Capital Markets  Noninteraction 
There are two approaches to study of evolving inequality  One is to look at ongoing random 
shocks  The other is to argue that there are intrinsic market forces which tend to separate 
individuals  The first approach typically consists in looking at the ergodic behavior of a 
single dynasty  and then equating this to the cross-sectional distribution of the system as a 
whole  This is the viewpoint epitomized in several papers  we discuss a variant of Loury 
  in these notes 
On the other hand  it should be obvious that the second type of analysis   inequality 
arising from market-generated separations across individuals   cannot be conducted by 
simply studying the intertemporal behavior of a single agent  Interactions are fundamental 
This is the topic of the next section  Here we study the single-dynasty model 
There is one agent alive at every date  and each agent has a single child  who becomes an 
adult in the next  period   or generation  An agent at date t has access to total resources yt 
 
which we may sometimes loosely call income  but is really to be interpreted as the sum of 
income and any starting wealth  The agent divides this into consumption  ct  and bequests 
for the next generation  kt 
yt   ct   kt 
 
Bequests create starting wealth yt  for the next generation  More than one interpretation is 
possible  these may be financial bequests  or upfront educational investments  the preferred 
interpretation by Loury  In any case  yt  is not fully pinned down by kt 
  A random shock 
 t        is also assumed to play a role  One might call this the ability of the agent at date 
t     Thus we have 
yt    f kt 
   t 
The Dynamics of Inequality  
where it is obviously reasonable to assume that f is increasing and smooth in the first 
argument and that we simply label abilities so that f is also increasing  and continuous  in 
the second argument  We assume that abilities are iid on     with a continuous density 
that is strictly positive on    
We will make further assumptions on f  but at present we only need to make one  that even 
for the highest ability  the production function ultimately  flattens out  limk  f 
 
 k       
 where f 
 
is the derivative with respect to the first argument  This can be justified at a couple 
of levels  but the main reason we do this is convenience  we want everything to be bounded 
so that we can analyze it simply   Why does this assumption guarantee that income and 
capital must be bounded  Draw a diagram of the  best-case  production function under 
this assumption and satisfy yourself 
Note that   unlike Loury   we do not assume that f is concave  This allows us to put other 
models in perspective  more on this below 
Now turn to preferences  We shall assume that each generation is a dynastic utility 
maximizer  that is  it seeks to maximize 
u c     EV 
where u is some smooth strictly concave utility function defined on current consumption 
        is a discount factor  and V is the expected lifetime utility to be experienced by the 
child  The expectation is taken before the V because it is assumed that the parent does not 
know how the child s ability will turn around at the time of making the educational bequest 
That is  given some y  a parent tries to maximize  choosing k 
  u y   k     E V 
 
f k   
 
subject to the constraint that     k   y  Notice that the function V is fundamentally 
endogenous and that it must solve the well-known functional equation 
V y    max 
 k y 
 
u y   k     E V 
 
f k   
 
That such a consistent V exists can be proved using standard arguments  which we omit 
here  It can also be shown that V is continuous in y 
 
The beauty of this sort of argument is that it essentially reduces an infinite-dimensional 
problem to something very simple  the one-variable maximization problem expressed in 
equation   From this problem we get what is called an  optimal  policy correspondence 
 y  This is the set of all k s which solve   given the starting value y  Notice that we 
have made no assumptions on the curvature of f so in principle this correspondence could 
have arbitrary shape  It turns out that the following monotonicity argument must be true 
Proposition   Suppose that y   y 
 
and that k    y  and k     y 
 
  Then it must be that k    k 
Proof  Verify that all the conditions of Proposition   are satisfied 
 The argument used to establish the existence  uniqueness and continuity of V is the famous Banach contraction 
mapping theorem  See Stokey and Lucas   for how this works with value functions such as those in this 
model 
  The Dynamics of Inequality 
Recall from Proposition   that this would immediately yield a convergence argument if 
there is no uncertainty  Of course  the current model does have uncertainty so this simple 
sequence argument cannot be applied   Try it and see where it fails  But nevertheless  the 
proposition continues to be helpful in this and in other cases  as we shall see in a bit 
Let s return to the convergence argument in the face of uncertainty  Is there some way 
in which we can approach this problem  Here I follow Loury in making the following 
additional assumptions on the production function 
Poor Geniuses Exist  f       
Rich Fools Exist  f k      k for all k    
I ve labeled the assumptions so that they are self-explanatory  Just in case  the first 
assumption states that even if you don t invest anything into a high-ability child  she will 
end up making some money  The second assumption states that low-ability children drain 
resources  whatever you put in  less comes out 
Under these two assumptions  the following important proposition is true 
Proposition   Let   be an initial probability measure on the set of initial incomes of generation 
zero  and denote by  t the distribution of income for generation t induced by the equilibrium behavior 
described above  Then there exists a unique measure  
 
such that  t converges to  
 
as t     and 
this measure  
 
is independent of  
It is important to understand why this result is true  as it leads to a significant insight into 
how uncertainty works in these models  To this end  consult Figure   He we show 
diagrammatically how income evolves from generation to generation within a dynasty 
starting with income y  at date   An investment of k  is made  and this leads to an uncertain 
income at the next generation  the little hill on the t     line marks the density of such 
incomes  A typical income realization is the level y  at which the investment k  is made 
and the whole process repeats itself  The density conditional on an investment k  is shown 
by the little hill on the t     line  while the thick density with larger support shows all 
possible values of y  two periods hence  that is  conditioning on y  but not on the specific 
realization of y 
Now  in this diagram I have marked out a special interval of incomes I which has the 
property that no matter where you start from  there will be a  common  date T such that 
these densities  conditional on the starting point   envelop  the interval I  with probability 
uniformly positive  This fact follows from the two assumptions we ve made above regarding 
 poor fools  and  rich geniuses   though  as we shall see in a bit  the assumptions are not 
necessary  The point is that with positive probability and at some uniformly chosen date 
the system will wander into I no matter what the initial conditions were 
A formal proof of this assertion is provided in Section   But intuitively  what this means 
is that the system must lose its memory  its history  at some point of time  for whatever 
happens with positive probability must happen for sure  That suggests that limit behavior 
is independent of history  which indeed is the broad substance of Proposition

If you want to know more about the technicalities of this ergodic theorem  look at the 
general result  Proposition   given in Section   Essentialy  the ability of the process to 
 communicate  or  mix  no matter what the initial conditions were  is responsible for the 
history-independent limit behavior of the system 
Another way to graphically examine the mixing property is to look at the policy functions 
generated as a result of dynastic optimization  While these map from current y to the current 
choice of k  we shall do this slightly different  the result is shown in Figure   The diagram 
places current income on the horizontal axis  and tomorrow s income on the vertical axis 
Of course  tomorrow s income is uncertain  and may therefore be represented by a band 
of possible incomes  which boils down to an interval of incomes for each value of today s 
income 
Now  in part  a  of this figure  notice that there are two clear zones  In Zone I  income must 
be bounded above by the value YI 
  which is the biggest intersection  in this region  of the 
stochastic correspondence with the  
line  By monotonicity of the policy correspondence 
it follows that if y   YI 
  y can never cross the value YI 
  even under the most optimistic 
conjectures regarding the realization of ability shocks  Likewise  there is a lower bound YII

in a different region of the policy correspondence  By the same logic  if y   YII  y can never 
fall below the value YII  even under the most pessimistic realization of ability shocks  Notice 
that in this diagram  YII exceeds YI 
  so that there two regions are effectively segregated 
Proposition   can thus never hold for this scenario 
Now study panel  b  of Figure   Here  there is an upper trap YII just as we had before 
but there is no  lower trap  incomes starting below can always wander into the zone to the 
right of YII  and must stay there therafter  Thus there is full mixing and the ergodicity result 
of Proposition   is restored 
But are the two assumptions concerning fools and geniuses met  Not really  We have 
reflected in panel  b  a variant of these assumptions  which does just as well  In fact 
convince yourself by drawing an imaginary panel  c  that if YI 
is well-defined but there is 
no YII  that this would be pretty much in line with the assumptions we do have  But now you 
also see that the specific form of our assumptions is not really necessary  what we are after 
is really the existence of a mixing zone  as described in Figure  s panel  b  for instance 
  Uncertainty  Inequality  and Ergodicity  What  then  is the precise role played by 
uncertainty in these models  To understand this  it will be useful to first strip the uncertainty 
away altogether  and simply look at a deterministic version 
First of all  suppose that the model is fully convex  that is  in addition to u being strictly 
concave  we shall also assume that f is strictly concave  in addition to assuming the endpoint 
conditions f 
 
      and f 
 
      Now the optimal policy correspondence is really a 
function  and by proposition   it must be a nondecreasing function  It is therefore easy 
enough to see   by iteration   that the sequence of dynastic incomes  y  y  y        must 
converge to some steady state y 
 
  It is also easy to see  under our assumptions  that y 
  must 
be strictly positive 
The Dynamics of Inequality  
At this stage we don t know what y 
 
is  We do not even know whether y 
 
is unique or not  Of 
course  it is unique given y  but nothing in what we ve said so far rules out the possibility 
that it might change as y  changes  But in fact  this cannot happen  and the easiest way to see 
this is to use the Euler equation to the solution of the optimization problem  which shows 
us that 
  u 
 
 ct     u 
 
 ct f 
 
 kt 
for all t     In the limit  yt   y 
 
  so it is trivial to see that kt and ct must converge as well  say 
to k 
  and c 
 
respectively  Passing to this limit in the Euler equation   we may conclude 
that 
    f 
 
 k 
 
     
which  by the way  is the famous formula for the  modified golden rule  in optimal growth 
problems  When f is strictly concave  the value of k 
 
is uniquely pinned down  There can 
be  therefore  no more than one value for limit income  no matter where one starts from 
Convergence occurs to perfect equality  though this may take time 
This brings us to the first role of uncertainty  by creating ongoing shocks  in this case to 
ability  it keeps individuals away from perfect equality  With each shock  one might think 
of the convergence problem as beginning again  but it is regularly perturbed by ongoing 
further shocks  Thus uncertainty acts as a tool to create inequality in a world of convergence 
Several economists who rely on convergence-based models generally invoke uncertainty to 
 explain  inequality   In fact  Loury s model assumes that f is strictly concave and is 
therefore an example of this 
Now suppose that we drop the concavity of f  Now   is still valid as an interior first-order 
condition  though we must be careful about checking second-order conditions  The main 
point  however  is that   will now admit several solutions in general  And indeed  there 
are now several steady states  depending on initial conditions  With decreasing returns 
dispensed with  history is perfectly capable of creating a lock-in effect  If there is inequality 
to start with  it may not go away  individuals may remain stuck in different steady states 
This multiplicity in the face of nonconvexities has been known for some time  see  e g 
Majumdar and Mitra   and more recently  the first part of Galor and Zeira  
But the possibility of such historical lock-in  arising from the convex f  brings us to a second 
role for uncertainty  which is its ability to remove such lock-ins  After all  the analysis in the 
previous section did not rely at all on the concavity of f  It is quite possible that the  mixing 
condition discussed there holds even when f has the  wrong  curvature  This means that 
uncertainty can actually remove lock-ins and restore equality  or at least equality of long-run 
opportunity  when in the presence of perfect certainty  such equality would be missing 
This sort of discussion suggests that a study of uncertainty in this context may be misleading 
at the same time that it may be illuminating  It may be misleading because even very small 
mixing probabiluities lead us back to ergodicity  for instance  assume that everyone has a 
small but positive probability of winning the state lottery  then the mixing condition would 
be satisfied  But it may be a long time coming  For this reason  an uncertainty-based theory 
may hide certain structural features of the model   For instance  we we ve seen  there is a 
  The Dynamics of Inequality 
deep difference between the case of concave and convex f  but somehow the presence of 
uncertainty permitted us to provide a mathematically similar treatment 
There is a final point about the role of uncertainty that might be worth making  It is peculiar 
to the noninteractive models that we have been discussing  Notice that with or without 
a mixing condition  it is possible to derive limit theorems regarding the distribution of 
income  in the following sense  starting from an initial y  the resulting distributions of 
income converge  The mixing condition simply adds that there will be a common limit to 
which the convergence occurs  Without the mixing condition   as in panel  a  of Figure  
  there will be several steady states  but two different limit distributions must have no incomes 
in common   If they did  the mixing condition would be satisfied  and we would not have 
two different limits in the first place 
This is a peculiar and interesting characteristic of the noninteractive model  and also points to 
its inadequacy  If one wants to use such models to explain varying different distributions in 
say  different countries with the same underlying fundamentals  one would have to contend 
with the uncomfortable prediction that the poorest person in one country must be richer 
than the richest person in the other country  The more realistic  but more complicated 
interactive models that study later will set us free of this difficulty 
  Technical Aside on Markov Processes and Existence of Mixing Interval   This 
section included for completeness only  Not for a development course 
Let P be a transition probability on some state space X  It will be useful to have notation 
for the m-step transition probability generated by P  This is  intuitively  the probability of 
the system being in the subset A after m periods  starting from some given state x  today 
Clearly  this is given by the measure  m  starting from the case where   assigns probability 
one to x  This measure we will denote in transition probability form as P 
m x  A  for any 
measurable subset A of X 
The fundamental condition to be investigated is 
Condition M  Stokey and Lucas   There exist       and an integer M     such that for 
any event A  either  i  P 
M x  A      for all x   X  or  ii  P 
M x  A 
C      for all x   X 
To appreciate condition M  let s look at a case when it is not satisfied  Consider the familiar 
two-state Markov chain in which  ij     if and only if i   j  for i  j       Pick A     Then 
for any positive integer M  P 
M x  A      either if M is even and x     or if M is odd and 
x     Otherwise  P 
M x  A      This means that condition M fails  We see therefore  that 
the real bite of condition M is in the postulated uniformity with which all states hit particular 
events 
Before we state the main result of this section  let us also relate Condition M to convergence 
in the Loury model  Let Y be the solution to f Y      Y  it is the maximum possible output 
level  We first prove a formalization of the claim made in the main text regarding the  mixing 
interval  I 
The Dynamics of Inequality  
Claim  There exists a date M  an interval I of incomes  and  
      such that for every 
measurable subset I  of I of measure  
Prob  yM   I y     
independently of y     Y 
Proof  By the assumptions on f and   and using the  rich genius  condition  there exists a 
compact interval I    A  B  with     A   B  and a number a with     a   A  such that the 
random variable f k    has strictly positive density on I for every k     a  Let  
  be the 
minimum value of this density  It is easy to see that under our assumptions   
     
It follows that for every measurable subset I  of I of measure  
  Prob  f k      I k     
independently of k     a 
For any y  and t     let Yt denote the random variable describing output at date t if all output 
is systematically invested up to date t  and none consumed  By the rich fools assumption 
there is some date M     and some probability       such that 
Prob  YM      a y     
independently of y     Y 
Now turn to the equilibrium policy  Look at the equilibrium value of kM conditional on any 
y     Y  Because kM   yM   YM  we see that 
  Prob  kM     a y     
independently of y     Y 
Combining   and   we must conclude that for every measurable subset I  of I of 
measure  
Prob  yM   I y     
independently of y     Y  and the claim is proved 
With the Claim in hand  it is easy to verify Condition M for the Loury model  Pick I  M and 
 
  as in the Claim  let   be the measure of I  and define      
  Now for any event A  either 
A   I has measure at least    in which case define I    A   I  or I   A has measure at least 
   in which case define I    I   A  Now apply the Claim to the set I  to verify Condition 
M 
The main result of this section concerns the implication of Condition M 
Proposition   Under condition M  there exists a unique invariant probability measure  
 
such 
that for any initial   on X  the generated sequence  t  converges strongly to  
 
 
Proof  We will follow the finite horizon case exactly  That is  we will show that 
  M   the set of all probability measures on X   equipped with the total variation 
metric is a complete metric space 
  The Dynamics of Inequality 
  The operator T 
M   M   M given by 
T 
M A

M x  A dx 
for all A  is a contraction 
  Thus T 
M has a unique fixed point  
  and the M-step iterates of any initial probability 
measure must converge to  
 
 
  The convergence of the entire sequence of measures  and not just this particular 
subsequence  can then be established by a subsequence argument identical to that 
used in the finite horizon case 
All the new stuff is in the first two items  To these we now proceed 
First we establish the completeness ofM  To this end  suppose that  
n 
  is a Cauchy sequence 
in M  then from the definition of the total variation metric  it follows that for each event A 
 
n 
 A  is a Cauchy sequence of numbers  By the completeness of the real line   
n 
 A  converges 
to some  A  for each A  We will show that   is a probability measure and that  
n 
converges 
strongly to  
It is obvious that  A        for all A  that  X      and that       It remains to prove 
countable additivity to establish that   is indeed a probability measure  To this end  let  Ai 
be a countable collection of disjoint events in X  Then

i Ai    limn 
X

where the second-last equality follows from the dominated convergence theorem  This 
proves that   is indeed a bonafide probability measure  What s left to do is to show that 
 
n 
        as n     Note that because  
n 
  is Cauchy  for all       there is N such that if 
n  m   N 
 
n 
 A     
m A     
for all sets A  Taking limits in m  it follows that 
 
n 
 A     A     
for all n   N  and for all A  which implies that  
n 
        as n    
This establishes the completeness of M 
Our next task is to show that T 
M is a contraction of modulus       To this end  pick  
and  
 
in M  Then there is a  common  part   and  idiosyncratic  parts  
  and  
 
  so that 
     
       
     
      and  
  and  
  have disjoint support 
Digression  The technical details of this assertion rely on the Radon-Nikodym Theorem  see 
Stokey and Lucas   Lemma   But one can informally illustrate how the common 
part is obtained in the case where   and  
  have densities f and f 
  on the real line  In this 
case  simply define g x    min f x  f 
 
 x  for each x   R  and integrate this as you would to 
get a cdf  to arrive at the common part of the measure   This measure   is  of course  not 
a probability measure  The idiosyncratic residuals  
  and  
  are then defined by inserting 
the rest of the probability  event by event  to bring total probability up to   and  
 
  In this

way you see that the measures  
  and  
  are not probability measures either  Now study 
the values  
 
 X  and  
 
 X  which are the values assumed by the measures on the entire 
state space  Note  first  that these must be equal to each other  Note  also  that their common 
value must be equal to the supremum difference between the probability measures   and  
 
over any event  To see this  note that for any event A

  Interactive Inequality 
It is now time to unpack the nature of the household production function  In many important 
situations  it is determined by relative prices  This nring us to models of interactive 
inequality  in which no household or dynasty can be treated as an isolated unit 
  Relative Prices and Efficiency Units  Economists have traditionally employed a 
simple shorthand for the study of occupational diversity  which is to reduce different 
qualifications and skills to aggregate quantities of  human capital  In other words  all 
human capital is   even before we write down the definition of equilibrium for the society in question 
  commonly expressible in some common efficiency unit  This approach is summarized 
by Becker and Tomes in their   paper 
 
So  for instance the investment choice in Loury s model is interpreted as a choice of  how much  education to 
acquire  there is no formal difference between human and physical capital  The so-called endogenous growth 
models  see  e g  Lucas   continue  by and large  to retain this shorthand 
  The Dynamics of Inequality 
Investment Levels 
Returns 
 Human Capital 
 Financial Capital 
Figure   Efficiency Units 
 Although human capital takes many forms  including skills and abilities 
personality  appearance  reputation and appropriate credentials  we further 
simplify by assuming that it is homogeneous and the same  stuff  in 
different families   Becker-Tomes   p  emphasis ours 
The crucial assumption is that the relative returns to different occupations are exogenous 
so that the reduction to efficiency units can be carried out separately from the behavioral 
decisions made in the population  It is  in fact  common to specify that the returns to human 
capital are concave while the return to financial investment is linear  see Figure  
It is unclear what different  levels  of human capital mean independent of the relative market 
returns  which are typically endogenous  We might all agree that skilled labor embodies 
more human capital than unskilled labor  But the assumption that skilled and unskilled 
can be reduced to a common and determinate yardstick of efficiency units presumes much 
more than this ordinal comparison  The implications of such an assumption can be quite 
significant  as we show in the next section 
  Endogenous Relative Prices  Persistent Inequality With Two Skills  The following 
analysis is based on Ray   Elements of this model appear in Ljungqvist  
Freeman   and Mookherjee and Ray   The specific exposition follows Ray  
Suppose that aggregate production is a CRS function of just two inputs  skilled and unskilled 
tasks  satisfying Inada conditions in each  There are two occupations  skilled and unskilled 
The Dynamics of Inequality  
labor  The latter can only do the unskilled tasks  Wages in each occupation equal their 
respective marginal products  and so depend on relative supplies of workers in the two 
occupations  Skill acquisition requires a fixed parental investment in education  Assume 
that this is the only way a parent can transfer wealth to their children  i e  there are no 
financial bequests  In a later section we drop this assumption 
Now observe that even if all parents in the economy have identical wealth and preferences 
they cannot all leave the same bequests  The reason is simple  If every parent keeps their child 
unskilled  there will be no skilled people in the next generation  raising the return to skilled 
labor enough that investment in skill will be the optimal response  Conversely  if all children 
are skilled  the return to skill will vanish  killing off the investment motive  Hence even 
if all families start equal in generation   some will invest and others will not  in the next 
generation their fortunes must separate 
Just who goes in one direction and who in another is entirely accidental  but such accidents 
will cast long shadows on dynastic welfare  Indeed  the two directions are utility-equivalent 
for generation   but not for generation   Furthermore  in succeeding generations wealthier 
parents will have a greater incentive to train their children  so that the  primitive inequality 
that sets in at the first generation will be reinforced  children of skilled parents will be 
more likely to acquire skills themselves  The logic of  symmetry-breaking  implies that 
every steady state in this example must involve persistent inequality  The endogeneity of 
occupational returns is central to this argument 
In contrast to this example  observe that the same argument does not apply to activities in 
which each unit is a perfect substitute for another  For instance  if shares in physical capital 
can be divisibly held  everyone can derive the very same rate of return on each unit  But a 
single individual cannot hold an arbitrarily fine portfolio of different occupations 
In the subsections that follow  I develop this argument in more detail 
  Preliminaries Time is discrete  running t               A dynasty is represented by 
an infinite sequence of individuals  each individual living for a single period  There is a 
continuum of dynasties so that a unit mass of atomless individuals belongs to a generation 
at each date 
There are two skill categories   high  and  low  which are combined via a production 
function f to produce a single final output  which we take to be the numeraire  An individual 
in the high-skill category  or a  high individual  for short  earns a wage w t at date t 
 
If skilled labor cannot perform unskilled tasks  the unskilled wage will become very high by the Inada 
conditions  But even if they can perform unskilled tasks  this will equalize the two wage rates  Either 
interpretation has the same outcome 
 
See e g  Katz and Murphy   for the responsiveness of US skill premia to relative supply of skilled workers 
 This discussion suggests  then  that the correct dividing line is not between  physical  and  human  bequests 
but rather bequests that result in endowments that are alienable  e g  money  and endowments that are not 
 e g  occupations  The latter may include transfers of physical assets such as a family business which is not 
incorporated   perhaps for reasons of moral hazard or simply the lack of development of a stock market  These 
transfers are no different from human bequests in their implications for disequalization  and should be included 
in the category of  occupational bequests 
  The Dynamics of Inequality 
Likewise  a low individual earns 
 
wt 
  Whether or not an individual is high or low depends 
on the investment made by her parent  Being low at any date requires no investment by the 
parent  being high requires an exogenous investment of x 
Earned income is partly consumed and partly used in educating the individual s offspring 
Depending on the education level of the child  the child receives an income next period  and 
the entire process repeats itself without end 
Now I turn to the determination of wages  Assume that the production function f for final 
output is smooth  CRS in its two inputs  strictly concave in each input and satisfies the Inada 
end-point conditions  Given a unit mass of individuals  if a fraction   of them is high at 
some date  then the high wage is given by 
w    f       
while the low wage is given by 
 
w    f       
where these subscripts represent partial derivatives  We will call these wages the wages 
associated with  
It is easy to see that w  is decreasing and continuous in   with w      as    
  Likewise 
 
w  is increasing and continuous in   with 
 
w      as       These 
observations imply  in particular  that there exists a threshold   such that w   
 
w 
To complete the description of the model  we presume that each generation t maximizes an 
additive function of the one-period utility ut from its own consumption  and the lifetime 
utility  Vt  felt by generation t     discounted by         The utility function u will 
be assumed to be increasing  smooth and strictly concave in consumption  and defined at 
least on  x    This last requirement is innocuous but serves to simplify notation and 
exposition  Moreover  the idea that consumption can go negative captures the idea that the 
borrowing constraint is never absolute  but that the investment of x at lower wealth levels 
entails ever greater utility losses  by strict concavity of u 
  Equilibrium Suppose  now  that an infinite sequence of wages is given  one for 
each skill category  We may denote this by the path  w t 
 
 
wt 
 
 
t 
  With such a sequence given 
consider the maximization problem of generation t  Denote by V 
t the lifetime utility for 
a high member of that generation  and by 
 
Vt 
the corresponding lifetime utility for a low 
member  Standard arguments tell us that the sequence  V

is connected over time in 
the following way  for each date t

and  
These maximization problems describe how education levels change from generation to 
generation  given some sequence of wage rates  To complete the equilibrium setting  we 
remind ourselves that the wages are endogenous  in particular  they will depend on the 
proportion of high individuals at each date

such that 
 i  Given   the path  t  is generated by the maximization problems described above 
 ii  For each t  w t and 
 
wt 
are the wages associated with  t 
 
Standard fixed-point arguments suffice to show that a competitive equilibrium exists  and 
we will not pursue such matters here 
Notice that our definition of competitive equilibrium assigns wages on the presumption that 
skilled labor must carry out skilled tasks  Alternatively  we could restate the definition so 
that if the  natural wages   as given by marginal product  for a skilled worker falls short of 
that of an unskilled worker  the former will move into the sector of the latter so that the two 
wages will be ex post equalized  None of this matters much anyway because of the following 
easy observation  which holds no matter what definition we use 
Observation   Recalling that   solves w   
 
w       t     for all t     along any

The formalities of the  obvious  proof are omitted 
From now on I will also presume that 
        as well  There is no great mystery in this  it saves the expositional trouble of 
having to qualify several arguments for the initial value of  
For later use  I also record a familiar single-crossing observation 
Observation   Under a competitive equilibrium  there is no date at which a low person creates a 
high child while simultaneously  a high person creates a low child 
The proof of this observation runs exactly parallel to  and in fact can be derived as a special 
case of  Proposition   and is therefore omitted

V be the 
 That  t     for all t follows from the fact that the difference between skilled and unskilled wages would be 
infinitely high otherwise  so that some educational investment would have taken place prior to that period 
 Here we use the assumption that u is defined on  x    On the other hand   t cannot exceed   for any t    
for in that case high and low wages are equalized  and no one in the previous generation would then have 
invested in high skills

Figure   The Set of Steady States 
Figure   plots the three terms in   as a function of   The left hand side  denoted by 
  is just the utility cost to a high parent of acquiring skills for her child  This lies uniformly 
below the right hand side  denoted by 
 
  which tracks the same utility cost to a low parent 
Finally  the middle term  denoted by B  is the present value of benefits to being high rather 
than low  Of course  the   and 
 
  lines meet at   because wages are equalized there 
The Dynamics of Inequality  
Note  moreover  that as       B turns negative while   is positive  On the other hand 
as       B grows unboundedly large while   is bounded above  Because the changes are 
monotone  there is a unique  
        such that the first inequality in   holds with 
equality  Observe  moreover  that at      
 
  the second inequality in   must hold as well 
because of the strict concavity of the utility function  Thus the set of steady states contains 
some interval to the left of  
 
  and must be a subset of    
 
Beyond this last observation  the set of steady states may be complicated  In particular  the 
set need not be connected  For instance  in Figure   the set of steady states is the union of 
the two intervals     and    
 
Notice that every steady state involves persistent inequality  not just in gross incomes but in 
net utility  In the subsection that follows  I show that the dynamics of an intertemporal 
competitive equilibrium leads society to one of these steady states 
  Dynamics Recall from the previous section that  
 
is a steady state  and it is the 
largest possible steady state  We now state and prove the following 
Proposition   If      
  then there exists a unique competitive equilibrium from   It goes to 
a steady state in one period           t 
for all t    
If      
  then along a competitive equilibrium  t converges monotonically to the smallest steady 
state no less than   Convergence is never attained in finite time unless   happens to be a steady 
state to start with  in which case  t     for all subsequent t 
The proposition provides a full account of the behavior of skill proportions over time 
starting from any initial condition  If that initial condition happens to be a steady state 
the proposition rules out any equilibrium path other than the steady state path itself  More 
interesting is the asymmetry of equilibrium behavior under the two remaining kinds of 
initial conditions  When   is larger than the largest conceivable steady state  convergence 
to a steady state occurs in a single unit of time  When   is such that there are steady states 
 above  it  convergence is gradual in that the process is never completed in finite time  This 
asymmetry may have interesting implications for unanticipated technical changes which 
once realized  are expected to stay in place thereafter  Changes that call for a reduction 
in steady state skill proportions take place quickly and dramatically  whereas a climb to a 
higher steady state is more gradual and drawn out 
Moreover  in the case that convergence is  up  to a steady state  the proposition asserts that 
it will occur to the nearest steady state to the right of the initial conditions  Put another way 
only the left-most steady state in each interval of steady states can be an attractor for initial 
conditions that are distinct from that steady state  and the basin of attraction is precisely the 
set of initial conditions that lie between it and the next  lower interval of steady states  if 
any  Thus  despite the multiplicity of steady states  final outcomes can be tagged to initial 
conditions in a unique way  allowing us in principle to perform comparative dynamics 
To provide some intuition for these results  first study a non-steady-state value of   that is 
smaller than  
 
  Why is this not a steady state  Surely  the  no-deviation  condition for the 
skilled  the first inequality in   is satisfied  after all  it was satisfied at  
 
  and now at 
  The Dynamics of Inequality 
the smaller value of   both the wage differential is higher and the utility cost of education is 
lower for the skilled  So  the reason why   fails to be a steady state is that the  no-deviation 
condition for the unskilled   the second inequality in     is violated  their utility cost 
of education is high  but not as high as the wage differential  To maintain equilibrium 
incentives  then  the economy-wide skill ratio must rise  compressing the sequence of wage 
differentials until the unskilled are exactly indifferent between acquiring and not acquiring 
skills   We have already seen in Lemma   that this compression to indifference is a necessary 
feature of non-steady-state equilibrium  otherwise no one would stay unskilled 
Now here is the main point  the skill ratio achieved in the very next period cannot be a steady 
state  For if it were  then the no-deviation condition of the unskilled must be satisfied here 
so that the new implied wage differential generates no incentive for them to acquire skills 
But the very same wage differential created indifference at date   when the utility cost of 
acquiring education was higher for the unskilled  This is a contradiction  By an obvious 
recursive argument  it follows that the upward movement in the skill ratio must be gradual 
and perennial 
Exactly the opposite is true for non-steady-state values of   that exceed  
 
  For such values 
the  no-deviation  condition for the skilled surely fails  the wage differential is too small 
relative to the utility cost of maintaining skills  So in equilibrium    falls  This fall along the 
equilibrium path raises wage differentials so that the skilled are now indifferent between 
maintaining and relinquishing skills 
We claim that the new skill ratio one period later must be a steady state  Suppose the claim is 
false  Then the new skill ratio is not a steady state  and this can happen for one of two 
reasons  First  the no-deviation condition for the unskilled fails   the wage differential at 
date   is too attractive  In that case  we already know that the remaining sequence of wage 
differentials  counting from date two on  must render the unskilled indifferent at date   But 
this means that the sequence of wage differentials counting from date one on is still attractive 
for the unskilled  and would have been a fortiori attractive relative to the skill-acquisition 
cost for the unskilled at the higher skill ratio prevailing at date   But this  in turn  exceeds 
the cost of skill maintenance for the skilled  which contradicts the fact that the equilibrium 
creates indifference for the skilled at date    see last sentence of preceding paragraph 
The second reason why the new skill ratio may fail to be a steady state is that the no-deviation 
condition for the skilled fails again  just as it did at date   This means that the skill ratio 
must fall even further in succeeding periods to create indifference for the skilled at date  
However  because the wage differential at date   is not attractive enough  this means that 
the entire sequence of wage differentials  counting the one at date   would not have been 
attractive enough for the very same skilled individuals  had they been located at date   but 
with the utility costs they possess at date   This would be a fortiori true if we were to replace 
the utility costs with the true utility costs of maintaining skills at date   which are higher 
But now we have a contradiction again  see the last sentence two paragraphs above  This 
completes our intuitive description 
Proposition   asserts convergence from every initial condition to some steady state 
Moreover  the particular steady state to which convergence occurs can be identified  and 
this is of interest because there are multiple steady states 
The Dynamics of Inequality  
How general are these results on convergence  in particular  do they extend to the case of 
several occupations  The simple answer is that I do not know  At the same time  as we are 
going to see in the next section  with endogenous relative prices the steady state findings are 
very general  With endogenous price determination and imperfect credit markets  steadystate 
inequality among ex-ante identical agents is inevitable under broad conditions  It 
would  therefore  be of great interest to see if the dynamic counterparts of the results in this 
section also carry over 
  More on Relative Prices and Persistent Inequality 
Recall the two-skill example with which we started the previous section  We argued that 
even with parents of identical wealth  symmetry-breaking must occur  in equilibrium 
after all  it cannot be that all parents skill their children  or that all parents leave their 
children unskilled  This symmetry-breaking led to persistent inequality  It is natural to 
ask whether the same results hold when parents can compensate low-skilled children with 
greater financial bequests  Symmetry-breaking would still occur  but only in  occupational 
space  there would be no inequality in overall wealth  human plus financial  In this section 
based on Mookherjee and Ray   I carefully investigate the validity of this argument 
A second assumption that we made is that there are only two occupations  On the face of 
it  this is is just a simplification  and indeed  most of the literature works off two or three 
occupations simply for expositional ease  But as we shall see  bringing in many occupations 
 all with varying relative prices  makes two major conceptual differences  The first is that 
 many  different levels of human capital can be chosen  along with financial bequests 
 see previous paragraph  From the household point of view   with all relative prices 
taken as given   we have then a standard  production function  of the form displayed 
in Figure   which is the outer envelope of all human and financial investments  But 
there is one difference  the shape of this  production function  is entirely dependent on 
endogenous relative prices  Viewed from this perspective  at the household level all 
returns to investments are driven by relative prices  Whether this gives rise to a concave 
 technology  or not does not depend on technology but on economics  and on economic 
equilibrium at that  Yet  we will have something quite definite to say about the curvature of 
this production function 
The second conceptual difference  as we shall see below  is that steady state inequality might 
remain but history-dependence tends to vanish  Recall in the the two-skill model  see Figure 
  that there isn t just inequality in steady state  there is a continuum of steady states 
Indeed  the dynamics studied in that model take us to different limit points depending on 
initial conditions  Thus the two-skill model displays not just persistent inequality  but also 
persistent dependence on initial conditions  or on  history 
It turns out that with a rich set of occupations  this history-dependence vanishes  This 
doesn t happen at the level of an individual dynasty  whose fortunes remain profoundly 
linked to the distant past  Rather  it happens to the economy as a whole 
  The Dynamics of Inequality 
  The Model  Occupations and Training  There is a compact measurable space H of 
occupations that will be used in the production of a single  aggregative final good  There is 
an exogenous training cost x h  for occupation h   H  denominated in units of final output 
Production  A single aggregate output is produced by physical capital 
and individuals 
who hold occupations in H 
Output y  net of the undepreciated capital stock  is produced by a continuous 
strictly 
quasiconcave CRS production function y   f k    where k is physical capital and   is 
an occupational distribution  a finite measure on H  It is helpful to interpret different 
occupations as corresponding to different kinds of human capital 
Prices and Firms  Firms maximize profits at given prices  Normalize the price of final output 
to   Let w    w h  denote the wage function  and p    r  w  the factor price function  where 
r is the rate of interest  Denote by c p  the unit cost function 
By constant returns to scale  profit maximization at positive output is possible if and only if 
c p      in that case call p a supporting price  If  k    is a profit-maximizing choice under the 
supporting price p  we will refer to it as an associated input vector 
In these notes  I assume that the rate of interest r is exogenously given and time-stationary 
One simple interpretation is that capital is internationally mobile and that our economy is 
a price taker on the world market  Under this interpretation we also assume  in effect  that 
people are not internationally mobile  the wage function w will be determined domestically 
See Mookherjee and Ray   for extensions 
Now that r may be treated as a parameter  say that w is a supporting wage if p    r  w  is a 
supporting price 
Families  There is a continuum of families indexed by i       All families are ex 
ante identical  so we endow     with Lebesgue measure   Each family i has a single 
representative at each date or generation  indexed by t  Call this agent  t  i 
Consider a member of generation t  She begins adult life with a financial bequest b and 
an occupation h  both  selected  by her parent  The latter is obviously shorthand for the 
assumption that the parent bears the costs of upbringing and education  the child can select 
the particular occupation with no difference to the formal analysis  The overall wealth 
of our generation-t adult is then W   b    r    wt h  where wt h  is the going wage for 
occupation h at date t 
The agent correctly anticipates factor prices pt     r  wt  for the next generation t     and 
selects her own financial and educational bequests  b 
 
  h 
 
  to maximize 
  U  W   x h    b 
 
    V     r b 
    wt h 
 
 
 As in Mookherjee and Ray   this may be generalized to allow training costs to depend on the pattern of 
wages  We conjecture that the principal qualitative results of this paper will continue to hold in that setup 
 As long as capital goods are alienable and shares in them can be divisibly held  having several capital goods 
makes no difference to the analysis 
 Endow the space of all nonnegative finite measures on H with the topology of weak convergence  We ask that 
output be continuous with respect to the product of this topology and the usual topology on k 
The Dynamics of Inequality  
subject to the no-intergenerational-debt constraint b 
      We assume that U and V are 
smooth  increasing and strictly concave  and that U has unbounded steepness at  
Now b 
  and h 
  become the financial and educational inheritance of her child   generation 
t       and the entire process repeats itself ad infinitum 
Clearly  we are using a specification of utility that allows for income-based altruism  More 
on this specification later 
The condition b 
      is a fundamental restriction stating that children cannot be held 
responsible for debts incurred by their parents  The capital market is active in all other 
senses  households can make financial bequests at the going rate r  and firms can freely hire 
in capital at the very same rate 
Equilibrium  Begin with an initial distribution of financial wealth and occupational choices 
A competitive equilibrium given these initial conditions is a sequence of wage functions wt 
  t  
            and occupational distributions  t 
  t               as well as occupational and bequest 
choices for each generation in each family ht i  bt i  such that for each t and each family 
i 
 a  person  t  i  chooses  bt i  ht i  to maximize the utility function in   given that 
her own starting wealth equals     r bt i    wt ht i 
 b  these decisions aggregate to  t at each t 
 t H     i      ht i    H 
for every Borel subset H of occupations  and 
 c  wt 
is a supporting wage  with associated input vector  t 
  kt  for some choice of kt 
 
Observe that equilibrium conditions place no restrictions on kt 
  Because there is international 
capital mobility  financial holdings by households need bear no relation to capital used in 
production 
A steady state is a competitive equilibrium with stationary prices and distributions   wt 
   t   
 w    for all t  and strictly positive output 
The following observation is useful  in steady state  the total wealth of every family  not just 
of the economy as a whole  must be stationary 
Observation   The wealth of every family is stationary in any steady state 
Proof  This follows directly from Proposition  
 When there is no international capital mobility  kt must equal the aggregate of financial holdings  and r must 
adjust to assure this equalization in equilibrium 
 In general  such an assertion is not true of the financial wealth or the occupational choice of a family  which 
may vary over time 
  The Dynamics of Inequality 
  The Becker-Tomes Benchmark  A special case of this model is the following 
elementary textbook exercise  only financial bequests are possible  earning interest r  and 
everyone earns a fixed wage w 
Stochastic shocks apart  this is exactly the specification for the Becker-Tomes   model 
which assumes a linear rate of return to parental investment in children  We will henceforth 
refer to this special case as the Becker-Tomes benchmark 
In this special case  a parent with wealth W simply selects b     so as to maximize 
U  W   b    V  w       r b   
Let the resulting wealth of the child be denoted W    w       r b  We may write W  as a 
function of W  w and r  W   W  w r  By our assumptions  W  is fully characterized by the first 
order conditions 
  U 
 
 
W  
W    w 
    r 
 
      r V 
 
 W   
with equality if W    w 
It is obvious that W   W  w r  is nondecreasing and continuous in W  So an iteration of this 
mapping from any initial condition W     will yield long-run wealth starting from W  Call 
this long-run wealth   Passing to the limit in   it is trivial to see that if w        
  U 
 
 
r    w 
    r 
 
      r V 
 
  with equality if     w 
Becker and Tomes impose the following restriction on bequest behavior   W 
 W 
     
justifying it by available empirical evidence  This implies that the wealth of all families 
will converge to a common limit   independent of initial wealth  To ensure that our larger 
model is consistent with this key equalization property of financial bequests  we impose a 
similar  though weaker  restriction in this special case 
 LP  Limited Persistence  For any r     and w     there is at most one solution in     w to 
 
As in Becker-Tomes   LP  also implies that limit wealth  w r  is well defined and 
independent of starting wealth as long as as that starting wealth strictly exceeds w  that 
is  as long as starting financial wealth is positive  Given  LP  here is how we define that 
limit wealth  Set  w r  equal to   where   solves   in all cases except the one in 
which 
U 
 
 
r    w 
    r 
 
      r V 
 
 
 A more sophisticated version of their model is Becker and Tomes   in which bequests in the form of 
human capital are also permitted  but human capital is a priori reduced to efficiency units and it is assumed that 
the rate of return to successive units of human capital is declining  In that variant  all families will aim to invest 
the  same  amount of human capital before turning to linear financial bequests  Indeed  we do not claim that our 
elementary textbook exercise captures the full implications of the Becker-Tomes models  An important theme 
in these papers is the interplay between luck and convergence  an issue that is not of relevance here 
The Dynamics of Inequality  
for all     w  in which case set  w r     
  The important point is that  w r  is the same 
no matter what the  positive  level of inital wealth is 
This condition is less restrictive than the original Becker-Tomes assumption on  W 
 W 
  though 
the reader is welcome to keep the stronger restriction in mind  as long as it is understood 
that an implicit restriction on the interest rate is also implied thereby 
Condition  LP  is extremely easy to check  The following observation illustrates this by 
studying the HARA class of preferences 
Observation   Suppose preferences satisfy the following restriction  There exists       such that 
V    U  and U belongs to the HARA family 
 H    U c U 
 c         c 
where         and nonzero  Then the limited persistence property is satisfied  with the single 
exception in which       and w     in which case it is satisfied for all but one value of r 
Provided that preferences satisfy a constant discount rate property  Observation   states 
that  LP  holds for utility functions that are iso-elastic or exponential  or belong to the HARA 
class which nests these as special cases 
It helps to illustrate bequest behavior in the setting with financial bequests alone for the 
special case of iso-elastic utility with discounting  U c     c 
          with       and 
V    U  with         Define         r  Intergenerational wealth movements in the 
Becker-Tomes benchmark with stationary  w r  then takes the form 
W   
    r 
        r 
W  
 
        r 
w 
if W  
w 
 
  and W    w otherwise  This allows us to calculate limit wealth 
   w r   
 
 
 
w if      
 
 r w if          
 
r 
 
  if        
 
r 
 
If       there are no  limiting  financial bequests in steady state in the Becker-Tomes 
benchmark  and  r  w    w  Limit wealth  w r  is finite only if          
 
r 
 
If r is high enough that this condition is not satisfied  limit wealth is infinite  our version 
of the limited persistence property is satisfied  whereas the Becker-Tomes version is not 
We only point this out to emphasize that the Becker-Tomes version of limited persistence 
imposes more than a restriction on preferences  but in any case we are also fundamentally 
interested in the case in which limit wealth is finite 
 The only subtlety here is one in which   holds with equality at     w  while the inequality   holds for 
all     w  In this case both limits w and   are potential candidates  but the correct limit for starting W   w is 
easily seen to be the latter  This is a nongeneric case of little import but in any case our definition handles it 
 Notice that there are two limit wealths in this case  one at infinity and one at zero  But there is only one limit 
wealth provided we start with strictly positive wealth  and this is what  LP  requires 
 While the case of unbounded limiting wealth is formally a special case  ongoing growth really calls for a 
different model  ideally one in which training costs are endogenous as well 
  The Dynamics of Inequality 
A Comment on Nonpaternalism  We end this section by pointing out that preferences 
are inconsistent with the limited persistence assumption  By the envelope theorem  the 
derivative of the value function is just the marginal utility of  equilibrium  consumption 
At a steady state  then  these marginal utilities drop out from the Euler equation  and the 
conditions become independent of wealth  In particular  an increase in parental steady 
state wealth translates into an equal increase in child wealth  so that  LP  fails  Dynastic 
preferences do not allow us to take the Becker-Tomes postulates fully on board 
Why do we want to incorporate  LP  in the first place  One answer is that it is empirically 
attractive  That may be so  but we do not impose  LP  for this reason  We do so because 
we want to show that this assumption generates a form of the steady state wage function 
that can never exhibit diminishing returns  If at all that wage function is nonlinear  it must 
be nonconvex at least over a region  This shows that the assumption that returns to human 
capital must be diminishing  Becker and Tomes   merits careful scrutiny  to say the 
least  None of these points emerge with dynastic preferences  and this   apart from financial 
bequests   is another basic difference from the analysis in Mookherjee and Ray  
  Two Occupations with No Financial Bequests  In what follows  we study an 
extremely simply case  one in which there are just two occupations  and financial bequests 
are nonexistent  You can suppose that we are in a world in which  w r    w for all w 
Call the two occupations  skilled  and  unskilled  labor  For unskilled labor take the 
training cost to be zero  For skilled labor assume that there is a exogenous training cost X 
which is just the number of units of the consumption good used as input into the training 
process  Let   denote the fraction of the population at any date that is skilled  If some 
well-behaved production function f  satisfying the usual curvature and Inada end-point 
conditions  determines the wage to skill categories  the skilled wage at that date will be 
given by w    f        while the unskilled wage will be given by 
 
w    f       
where subscripts denote appropriate partial derivatives  This yields the following simple 
characterization  a fraction   of skilled people is compatible with a steady state if and only 
if 
U  w    u  w    X    V  w    x    V  
 
w 
  U  
 
w    U  
 
  w    X 
The left hand side of   represents the utility sacrifice of a skilled parent  hereafter 
denoted by  
s 
  in educating its child  while the right hand side is the corresponding 
sacrifice for an unskilled parent  denoted by  
u 
  The term in the middle is the present 
value benefit of all successive descendants being skilled rather than unskilled  which we 
shall denote by b 
 This applies only in the unrealistic event that skilled workers cannot perform unskilled tasks  More generally 
if skilled workers can perform unskilled tasks  then the skilled wage cannot ever fall below the unskilled wage 
So when the skill intensity   is large enough that f    f  wages will not be given by f  and f  but will be 
equalized  as a result of skilled workers filling unskilled positions whenever the latter pay higher wages  We 
omit this minor complication here because a competitive equilibrium with a positive fraction of skilled workers 
will never give rise to wage differentials that are incompatible with incentives for parents to educate their 
children

which the wages of the skilled net of training equal those of the unskilled  So b drops to zero 
there  These observations can be used in conjunction with   to establish 
Proposition   There is a continuum of steady states in the two-profession model with exogenous 
training costs  and both per capita income and consumption rise as the skill proportion in steady state 
increases 
Proposition   tells us that multiplicity   in the sense of a continuum of steady states   is 
endemic for a small number of professions  While stated only for the two-profession case  it 
is easy enough to extend the argument to any finite number of distinct professions 
Notice that the structure of the set of steady states may be complicated  In particular  the set 
need not be connected  For instance  in Figure   the set of steady states is the union of the 
two intervals     and    
The proposition also states that steady states are ordered not only in terms of skill premium 
but also per capita income  a steady state with a higher   and lower skill premium 
corresponds to higher per capita income net of training costs  This does not  however 
imply that these steady states are Pareto-ordered  For a detailed discussion of efficiency  see 
Mookherjee and Ray  
  The Dynamics of Inequality 
  A Rich Set Of Occupations  For a while  now  we shall abandon the idea of just two 
occupations and go to the opposite extreme  in which we examine what happens with a rich 
set of occupations  Two assumptions characterize richness 
 R  The set of all possible training costs is a compact interval of the form   X 
 R  For every subset C     X  of positive Lebesgue measure  if the occupational 
distribution has zero value over every occupation h with x h    C  then no output can 
be produced 
Thus we don t ask that every occupation be essential  only that  almost  every training cost 
in   X  has an essential occupation attached to it  Observe that conditions  R  and  R 
really go together as a pair  without some restriction like  R   R  can always be trivially 
met by simply inventing useless occupations to fill up the gaps in training costs 
Together   R  and  R  imply that whenever positive output is produced  the inhabited 
range of  equilibrium training costs  is always equal to   X 
We justify richness by noting that while there are large differences in training costs between 
unskilled occupations  such as farm workers or manual jobs  and skilled occupations  such as 
engineers  doctors and lawyers  there are also many semi-skilled occupations  technicians 
nurses and clerks  with intermediate training costs and wages  Besides  there are large 
differences in the quality of education within any given occupation  which translate into 
corresponding differences in education costs and wages 
The methodological innovation in the richness asumption is that it allows families to fully 
fine-tune their investments  Whether or not their investment set is convex depends  then 
not on assumed indivisibilities in training costs but in the endogenously determined factor 
price schedule 
Note that  R  includes a bit more than occupational richness  It states that there is an 
occupation with zero training cost  a restriction that we impose for expositional ease 
  Steady States With Rich Occupations  Fix a steady state  Say that an occupation 
 or training cost  is inhabited if some family chooses that occupation  or incurs that training 
cost  By the richness conditions  we know that every steady state  which has positive output 
by definition  must exhibit a full measure of inhabited training costs  Suppose that we can 
alter the wage function on the small set of uninhabited occupations without changing any of 
the observed features of the steady state  Then we will say that the new steady state wage 
function  which only differs by specifying different wages for uninhabited occupations  is 
an equivalent representation of the old 
One particular representation is of interest  in which all occupations with the same training 
cost command the same wage  In that case  though with some abuse of notation  we shall 
go back and forth between w h  and the representation w x 
Proposition   Assume  R   R  and  LP 
 a  Every steady state has an equivalent representation with a continuous wage function 
The Dynamics of Inequality  
 b  In an equal steady state  this equivalent representation may be described as follows  there exists 
w     such that

for all x  In that steady state  all families attain a common wealth of  w r  and

    r 
 
where X is the highest training cost across all occupations 
 b  In an unequal steady state  the equivalent representation may be described as a two-phase wage 
function  there exists w     and       X  such that for all occupations h with x h       
holds 
w h    w       r x h 
Families that choose any of these occupations at any date all attain a common wealth of  w r  that 
is precisely equal to w 
On the other hand  for all occupations h with x h      w and x are connected via the following 
differential equation 
  w 
 
 x   
U 
 w x    x 
V 
 w x   
with endpoint constraint that the wage at cost   equals w    w       r 
Families in such occupations attain a wealth that is strictly greater than  w r  and the marginal 
rate of return to these occupations  w 
 x  strictly exceeds     r almost everywhere 
The outline of the argument is as follows  Since  almost  every training cost must have 
at least one inhabited occupation  the marginal rate of return on training costs must be at 
least r everywhere  In other words  the presence of human capital allows parents to transfer 
wealth to their children at  weakly  lower cost than in a Becker-Tomes benchmark where 
only financial bequests are possible  Hence every family must attain at least the wealth 
 w r  that would have arisen in the latter context  corresponding to the flow wage w that 
is available to every generation even in the absence of any educational investment  In an 
equal steady state  the rate of return on human capital at all levels is exactly r  so that the set 
of investment options is exactly the same as in a Becker-Tomes benchmark with stationary 
 w r  Therefore all families attain precisely the wealth  w r 
Finally  equation   must hold in such a steady state  because the occupation with the 
highest training cost X must have a wage of w       r X  and must be willingly chosen by 
some family 
In an unequal steady state it is trivial to see that the rate of return to some occupation must 
then exceed r  If not  the set of investment options would be just as in a Becker-Tomes 
benchmark with financial bequests alone  and wealth equality is then the only possible 
long-run outcome 
What is more subtle is the exact form the wage function must take  The proposition claims 
that the wage function has two phases  For low-end occupations  financial and human 
  The Dynamics of Inequality 
rates of return coincide and the wage function is linear  This phase has an endogenous 
delineation  any occupation with training cost below the steady state financial bequest in 
the Becker-Tomes benchmark with  w r  must generate a rate of return of exactly r   Note 
well that w  the lowest wage  is endogenous 
For occupations with training costs that exceed the Becker-Tomes steady state bequest  the 
rates of return must be high enough to induce willing settlement  This requirement creates 
at least a local nonconvexity of the steady state wage function  the marginal rates of return 
to such occupations will exceed r 
A closer inspection of the differential equation   reveals that the shape of the wage 
function in the second phase relies entirely on preferences  To be sure  and as we shall see 
more clearly below  the existence and range of this phase will depend  among other things 
on the technology  For a large class of preferences  the wage function exhibits a  global 
nonconvexity  in the sense that the marginal rate of return rises monotonically with training 
costs beyond  
Observation   Consider either the constant elasticity case with U c     c 
               
or the case of exponential utility U c     exp c        and V    U  Then the marginal rate of 
return on occupations monotonically increases with training cost beyond the boundary   described 
in Proposition  
In the case of exponential utility  the wage function takes the form  for x    
  w x   
 
  exp x     w r   
 
  exp 
In the constant elasticity case w 
 x  monotonically increases to a finite asymptote that strictly exceeds 
    r 
This description stands the traditional theory on its head  That theory presumes   usually 
by assumption   that the rates of return to human capital must be declining in training 
cost  see  for instance  Loury   and Becker and Tomes   Therefore the poorer 
families make all the human capital investment  and once families are rich enough so that 
the marginal return on human capital falls to the constant rate assumed for financial capital 
all other bequests are financial 
In contrast  Proposition   is stated in a context in which the relative earnings of different 
occupations are allowed depend on the occupational distribution  for which there is 
considerable empirical evidence  e g  Katz and Murphy   The proposition then asserts 
that the theory endogenously generates rates of return that run counter to the assumptions 
made in the literature  Financial bequests are made at the low end  while  occupational 
bequests  carry a higher rate of return and are made by richer families  If a rich set of 
occupations is essential  the concavity of returns to human capital is never an equilibrium 
outcome in any unequal steady state 
As an aside  we note that we haven t yet provided conditions for a steady state to be unequal 
but will soon proceed to an analysis of this question

Figure   A Extension to Three Phases 
It is important to see that the predicted shape of steady state wage functions depend 
fundamentally on the limited persistence assumption  If several occupations are essential in 
steady state  then to sustain the  wealth-spreading  necessitated by those occupations and 
to counteract convergence  wage functions must display a nonconvexity  A dynastic model 
such as the one studied in Mookherjee and Ray   fails  LP  and cannot deliver this 
property of wage functions in steady state 
Are our predictions counterfactual  We think not  First  it is well known from inequality 
decomposition studies that earnings inequality accounts for most of overall income inequality 
For instance  Fields   summarizes observations from several studies  writing that 
that  labor income inequality is as important or more important than all other income sources 
combined in explaining total income inequality 
Second  there is evidence that within the class of financial bequests  which are admittedly 
large for rich families  intentional bequests are not important  For instance  Gokhale et 
al   argue that most financial bequests in the US economy are unintentional  the 
result of premature death and imperfect annuitization  In the iso-elastic example  this 
would correspond to the case with   below unity  Our theory then predicts that there are 
no intentional bequests anywhere in the wealth distribution  so human capital differences 
entirely account for all inequality  perhaps supplemented by unintended financial bequests 
 which we do not formally model 
Third  it is important to remember that by  occupations  we mean not just human capital but 
every productive activity that is inalienable  This includes human capital but it is certainly 
not restricted to it  In particular  it is possible to view large financial bequests observed at 
the top end of the distribution as a form of occupational investment by parents  in the form 
of transfer of ownership or control of  partly inalienable  business activities 
 For a model of unintended bequests arising from uncertain life span  see  e g  Fuster  
  The Dynamics of Inequality 
Finally  it is easy to generate variants of this model which exhibit financial bequests at both 
upper and lower ends of the wealth distribution  For instance  suppose that financial wealth 
can be left at two rates of return  one at the existing rate r and another at a higher rate r 
 
  only 
accessible when the level of financial bequests crosses some threshold  Then it can be shows 
 I do not do this here  that in general  a steady state wage function will have a  three-phase 
property  Phases I and II look just like they do in this proposition  In phase III there is a 
return to linearity  this time at the higher rate r 
 
  Financial bequests are left at both ends of 
the wealth distributrion  Figure   illustrates 
  Existence and Uniqueness With Richness  Existence  Having gained an understanding 
of the structure of steady states in this model  we can now provide conditions on 
the technology and preferences that guarantee the existence of a steady state 
Our definition of a steady state includes the requirement that output must be positive  so that 
existence is typically nontrivial  Proposition   informs us that a steady state must assume 
a particular form  In fact  it is easy to see that given some baseline wage w for unskilled labor 
that proposition fully pins down the wage function  The only scope for variation lies in w  It 
comes as no surprise  then  that the existence of a  nondegenerate  steady state depends on 
the economy being productive enough to sustain positive profit at one of these conceivable 
wage functions 
Of course  that isn t enough  Proposition   describes what a steady state necessarily looks 
like  but is silent on the question of whether such a description is indeed sufficient for all the 
steady state conditions  This  too  will need to be addressed 
We proceed  then  by searching for a steady state using the features described in Proposition 
  To this end  we describe the family of all two-phase wage functions  Start with a given 
baseline wage of w  and set w x    w       r x for all training costs no greater than 
 w    min 
 w r    w 
    r 
  X 
 This corresponds to the old threshold   used in Proposition   but now we make the 
dependence on w explicit  For occupations with higher training costs   if any   the wage 
function is set to satisfy the differential equation  
w 
 
 x   
U 
 w x    x 
V 
 w x   
with the endpoint constraint that the wage for training cost  w  equals w       r w  or 
equivalently   w r 
 There is a family resemblance here to the existence of steady states in the multisectoral optimal growth model 
which requires a  productivity condition   see Khan and Mitra   Fixed point arguments that neglect such 
a productivity condition  as in Sutherland   are bound to fail because they do not eliminate the trivial 
outcome with zero output and wealth all around 
The Dynamics of Inequality  
This procedure generates a unique wage function corresponding to any choice of w  Repeat 
this procedure for every w     we now have the entire two-phase family  with either one of 
the phases conceivably degenerate 
Given what we know already  the following  productivity  condition is necessary for the 
existence of a steady state with positive output 
 P  Unit costs c r  w  are less than or equal to   for some two-phase wage function 
It is easy enough to rewrite  P  as a productivity condition  For instance  if the production 
function is written as A f f    where A is some Hicks-neutral productivity parameter   P 
states simply that A is large enough 
As the following proposition reveals  condition P  in conjunction with the other maintained 
assumptions  is also sufficient for the existence of a steady state with positive output 
Proposition   Under  R   R  and  LP  a steady state with positive output exists if and 
only if  P  is satisfied 
Condition  P  isn t at all difficult to verify  one way or the other  As an example  suppose 
that each training cost x corresponds to a unique occupation  so name it x as well  and that 
the production function takes the Cobb-Douglas form 
ln y         ln k  
Z X 
 
 x  ln x dx   ln A 
where A is a productivity parameter   x      and R 
 x dx           Then it is easy to see 
that for any wage function w 
ln c r  w         ln r   ln       
Z X 
 
 x ln w x    ln x dx   ln A 
The verification of  P  therefore simply entails the choice of a wage function that minimizes 
R 
 x w x  and then checking whether the resulting expression above is nonpositive 
Uniqueness  Proposition   already takes a significant step towards uniqueness by 
establishing that any steady state wage function  or at least its continuous equivalent 
representation  must lie in the two-phase class  As described in detail earlier  it is linear 
with return r over a range of training costs  and then displays a marginal rate of return 
that strictly exceeds r  In a broad class of cases  see  e g  Observation   this marginal 
return can be shown to be ever-increasing  though it will usually possess a finite asymptote 
Finally  the training-cost threshold separating the two phases precisely corresponds to the 
Becker-Tomes limit bequest with wage equal to the lowest wage along this function 
 If  w    X  the second phase is degenerate  Remember that at w      r  is the limit of  w r  as w     It 
may or may not equal   which is always trivially a limit wealth  If it is  the first phase is degenerate 
 If  P  fails  it is easy to construct a steady state with zero output  simply construct the two-phase wage function 
that starts from a baseline wage of zero  and place all individuals in the zero-wage occupation 
  The Dynamics of Inequality 
To be sure  the same economic fundamentals are consistent   at least in principle   with 
several wage functions drawn from this two-phase class  But this is what the uniqueness 
proposition rules out 
Proposition   Assume  R   R  and  LP  Then  apart from equivalent representations 
which change no observed outcome  there is at most one steady state 
As already discussed  this uniqueness proposition has far-ranging implications  Apart from 
Mookherjee and Ray   to be discussed in more detail below  this observation has gone 
unnoticed in the literature because the literature typically concentrates on a sparse set of 
occupations  usually two  as in Galor and Zeira   or occasionally three  as in Banerjee 
and Newman   In such cases multiplicity is indeed endemic  but once the set of 
occupations expands such multiplicity must shrink  We reiterate that the expansion of the 
set of occupations does not convexify the set of choices  Indeed  as Proposition   takes 
pains to explain  equilibrium nonconvexity is the rule rather than the exception 
Following up on this point  our uniqueness proposition does not rule out the pathdependence 
of economic fortunes for individual families  The identities of those who inhabit 
the different occupational slots is up for grabs and may   will   depend on historical 
accident  But their numbers cannot 
Proposition   is a substantial extension of the uniqueness theorem in Mookherjee and Ray 
  to a context in which financial capital co-exists with human capital  Indeed  given the 
simplified context of our model  the uniqueness result of Mookherjee and Ray   can 
be seen very easily and intuitively 
Imagine reworking Proposition   by imposing the additional constraint that no financial 
bequests are permitted  One would reasonably suppose  then  that the first phase of the twophase 
function would disappear  and that any steady state wage function must be governed 
by the differential equation   throughout  Now it is easy to see why there can be only 
one such wage function  If we begin at two different initial conditions and apply  
thereafter  the two wage trajectories cannot cross   a well-known property for this class 
of differential equations  In short  if there are two steady state wage functions  one must lie 
entirely above the other  But now we have a contradiction  for two wage functions ordered in 
this way cannot both serve as bonafide supporting prices for profit maximization  We obtain 
uniqueness when there are no financial bequests 
While this serves as some intuition for the result at hand  different considerations emerge 
when financial bequests are permitted  Now crossings of the two putative steady state wage 
functions cannot be ruled out by taking recourse to uniqueness theorems for differential 
equations  After all  the behavior of the wage functions is not governed throughout by 
  a nontrivial  first phase  makes an appearance  Instead  the formal proof must rely 
on behavioral arguments  based on household optimization  to rule out such crossings 
 Apart from the central difference of financial bequests  there are two differences between our model and that 
of Mookherjee and Ray   First  they use a nonpaternalistic bequest motive and work with value functions 
Second  training costs are endogenously determined in their model  However  these differences are minor and 
can be readily accommodated 
The Dynamics of Inequality  
  Conditions for Inequality  We are now in a position a key question  under what 
conditions does the steady state of the model involve inequality rather than equality  In the 
language of Proposition   when must the second phase of the two-phase wage function 
necessarily be nonempty 
A simple preliminary exercise lays the groundwork for a complete characterization of this 
question  This exercise concerns the production technology alone and has nothing to do 
with preferences 
Consider the class of all linear wage functions of the form w x    w       r x defined on all 
of   X  parameterized by w    
Observation   Assume  P  Then there is a unique value of w   call it a   and a corresponding 
linear wage function w  with w 
 x    a       r x for all x   such that c r  w 
     
Now a isn t an explicit parameter of our model  But for all intents and purposes it is an 
exogenous primitive  To compute a all one needs is a knowledge of the production function 
As an example  recall the Cobb-Douglas case studied in Section   in which each training 
cost corresponds to a single occupation  Cobb-Douglas form 
ln y         ln k  
Z X 
 
 x  ln x dx 
Using the same logic as in that case  it is easy to see that a must solve the equation 
     ln r   ln       
Z X 
 
 x ln a       r x    ln x dx    
provided that condition P holds 
We are now in a position to state our central result concerning persistent inequality 
Proposition   Under  R   R   LP  and  P  the unique steady state is unequal if and only 
if 
   a r    a       r X 
We shall refer to the inequality   as the widespan condition  It is made up of two parts  As 
we noted above  the parameter a is entirely a feature of the production technology and the 
range of the occupational structure  On the other hand  the Becker-Tomes limit wealth map 
  is entirely a feature of preferences  The widespan condition states that Becker-Tomes limit 
wealth   commencing from a   is not enough to  span  the entire range of occupations 
it  net of a and discounted by the interest rate  is smaller than the span X  Proposition  
declares that in all such cases  the steady state must exhibit persistent inequality 
One should be careful enough to note that   may not prescribe a unique threshold for 
the span X  Such an interpretation is suggested by the rewriting of the condition as 
X  
 a r    a 
    r 
 
  The Dynamics of Inequality 
but observe that both a and X depend on the training cost technology  To make this a more 
precise  consider economies that are identical in all respects except for their training cost 
functions  which are drawn from an ordered family  all starting at   for some occupation 
Such an ordered family may be parameterized by the highest training cost X 
In this class  it is very easy to see that a depends negatively on X  Therefore provided 
that  w r  w is nondecreasing in w  we do generate a single-threshold restriction on span 
 there is X 
 
such that widespan holds if and only if X   X 
  This will be true  for instance  for 
isoelastic preferences  see   and the accompanying discussion below  More generally 
though  widespan must hold for all training costs large enough  even though   may not 
imply a single threshold for X 
Uniqueness plus widespan tells us that there is just one steady state  but it must treat 
individuals unequally  Conversely  if widespan fails  there is convergence to a common level 
of wealth for all families  The proposition asserts  therefore  that whether the disequalization 
or the equalization view of the market is relevant depends on whether or not the widespan 
condition is satisfied 
Observe that under widespan  the market must act to separate identical or near-identical 
families  as described informally in Section   Long-run equality is not an option  However 
this paper does not contain an explicit account of dynamic equilibria from non-steady-state 
initial conditions 
The discussion following the statement of Proposition   continues to be relevant here 
There is no history-dependence  in the large  as the steady state is unique  But just where 
an individual family will end up in that distribution profoundly depends on the distant 
history of that family 
The strength of the characterization result in Proposition   is such that it renders the proof 
of this proposition almost trivial  See Appendix 
  Applications and Implications  To illustrate the implications of the span condition 
in Proposition   it is useful to invoke the example of an iso-elastic utility function 
Recall  in particular  equation   and the discussion following it  If    
 
 r 
    is 
always satisfied and an equal steady state never exists  There are effectively no financial 
bequests in the limit  so the model reduces to the disequalization model in which financial 
bequests are not allowed  If  on the other hand         
 
r 
then  a r      and   fails 
Financial bequests overwhelm any inequality arising from the need to provide occupational 
choice incentives  and an unequal steady state cannot exist 
In the intermediate case in which   is neither too large nor too small    tells us that 
 a r   
 
    r     a 
where         r  so that the widespan condition reduces to 
 
    r     a   a       r X 
The Dynamics of Inequality  
Rearranging  we obtain the following version of widespan 
  X   a 
     
    r     
We now describe effects of varying parameters of the model  which are relevant to explaining 
cross-country differences  or effects of technological change 
 a  Differences in TFP Levels  Suppose we compare two countries which differ only in their 
levels of total factor productivity  TFP  Then for any common value of X  the poorer country 
has a lower value of a  implying that it is more prone to disequalization  Intuitively  the 
lower level of wages reduces the intensity of the parental bequest motive  they are less 
willing to undertake the educational investments for high-end occupations  The resulting 
shortage of people in high-end occupations causes a rise in the skill premium  This elicits 
the requires supply into high-end occupations  but makes wealth inequality more acute 
Technologically poorer countries are therefore more prone to disequalization 
Of course  this argument is based partly on the assumption that the range of training costs X 
is unaffected by wages  However  it is easy to incorporate this extension under the plausible 
assumption that both human and physical inputs enter into production  Then X lower in the 
unproductive country  but not by the same factor as a  This argument is obviously reinforced 
if poorer countries also possess a less productive educational technology 
 b  Differences in TFP Growth Rates  While TFP-related differences in poverty are positively 
associated with disequalization  higher growth may be positively related to it as well  For 
instance  if growth  from Hicks-neutral technical progress  causes all wages and costs to 
grow at a uniform rate  then   all other things being equal   the level of desired bequests 
will be dulled  raising the likelihood of disequalization 
To the extent that poorer countries grow faster owing to a  catch-up  phenomenon in 
technology  the widespan condition is therefore more likely to hold on two counts  higher 
poverty and higher growth  Of course  the net result is ambiguous if subsequent growth 
isn t positively correlated with initial poverty 
 c  Changes in Interest Rates  A change in the rate of return to capital has subtle effects  When 
r rises    also goes up  Both these effects work against the widespan condition  by raising the 
rate of return to financial bequests  So a first cut at this issue would suggest that an increase 
in the global rate of return to physical capital tends to be equality-enhancing  However 
there is the possibility that a may be lowered by the increase in r  This effect runs in the 
opposite direction  and a full analysis is yet to be conducted 
 d  Reliance on Physical Capital Now let us compare economies with differing degrees of 
mechanization  i e  reliance on physical capital vis-a-vis human capital in production  One 
 We omit a formal demonstration of this assertion  which proceeds by deriving an equivalent of the widespan 
condition   in the presence of neutral technical progress 
  The Dynamics of Inequality 
simple way to do this is to suppose that final output is produced via a nested function 
y   Ak m 
 
 
where m is a composite of the occupational inputs  e g  an intermediate good  produced 
by workers  Then greater mechanization corresponds to a rise in   Setting the marginal 
product of capital to the interest rate r  we obtain 
k 
m 
 
 
A 
r 
   
 
 
so that the indirect  reduced-form  production function is linear in m 
y   Bm 
where 
B   A 
 
A 
r 
   
 
 
Notice that B essentially prices the composite in terms of the final output  If B goes down 
for some reason  then w  will decline  So a reduction in B  other things being equal  will 
contribute to a greater likelihood of disequalization  Whether B goes up or down with  
depends on the ratio of A  TFP  to r 
  In relatively  unproductive  economies in which A 
is small  an increase in physical capital intensity lowers B  making inequality more likely 
The opposite is the case in  productive  economies in which A is large  We thus obtain an 
interesting answer to a classic question in the theory of distribution  the impact of greater 
mechanization in production on long-run inequality 
 e  Wider Product Variety  Wider occupational spans may be the outcome of introduction 
of new goods and services  owing to technological change  The production of new goods 
and services such as information and communication technology creates an entirely new 
set of occupations  Such occupations are likely to require high levels of education and 
training  which may be thought of as an increase in the span of occupations and associated 
training costs  Unlike the parameterization used in Proposition   such changes involve 
an increase both in X and in the productivity of the technology  In terms of   both X 
and a tend to rise and the net effect depends on the ratio of these two variables 
We have not yet analyzed this application in detail  but it is clear that the effect of wider 
product variety on inequality is a very important question 
 f  When   holds  the rising rate of return to occupations  as captured by Observation 
  is an important prediction of the theory  We have discussed this already  but it bears 
repetition that this derived property of the model contradicts the assumed properties of human 
capital in Becker and Tomes   and others  Empirical research will take us closer to 
settling this issue 
 The intuitive reason why this is the appropriate comparison is that A becomes the productivity of capital in 
the limiting case when      
The Dynamics of Inequality  
  A Summary  We ve addressed two central questions in the theory of income distribution 
 I  Do competitive markets equalize or disequalize wealth allocations 
 II  Does history matter  Are the same economic fundamentals consistent with multiple 
steady states 
We study a model of intergenerational bequests which allows for both financial bequests 
as well the choice of a rich variety of occupations  A fundamental postulate of the model 
is that occupational inputs are imperfect substitutes  so that factor prices are endogenously 
determined  At the level of an individual household  occupational investments may be 
fine-tuned to an arbitrary degree  provided that there is rich variation in occupations and 
training costs  But the returns to these occupations are endogenous  and the equilibrium 
of the market will determine whether households face a convex or nonconvex investment 
technology 
We provide a complete characterization of steady states  We show that if there is inequality 
in steady state  so that question I has been answered affirmatively  then the steady state 
wage function must be linear over a section and convex over others  so that each family 
must face an investment nonconvexity  This finding is at sharp odds with existing literature 
that simply assumes the opposite  that the rate of retrun to human capital must exhibit 
diminishing returns 
Our characterization permits us to move on to the two central questions  We prove that with 
a rich set of occupations  the steady state must be unique  There may  and generally will 
be path-dependence at the level of dynastic choices  but the overall distribution of outcomes 
must be independent of history  This provides an interesting negative answer to question 
II  and in this way challenges a literature that is predicated on steady state multiplicity 
The second principal goal is to address question I  we extend and unify three seemingly 
different views of market-driven inequality  equalization  embodied in traditional theories of 
income distribution  disequalization  central to the recent endogenous inequality literature 
and neutrality  that either can happen depending on historical conditions  We show that a 
fundamental condition  which we call the widespan condition  allows us to predict whether 
the steady state must involve inequality or not 
The widespan condition draws attention to an aspect of technology that has received little 
attention in the literature  the range or  span  of occupational structure  Whether equality 
or inequality results from market mechanisms depends on this key parameter representing 
the extent of occupational diversity  relative to the strength of bequests 
The theory has several potential applications and implications 
We end with a final comment on question II  Our uniqueness result stems from the assumed 
richness in occupational investments  Whether or not such richness exists therefore deserves 
to be studied empirically  If the assumption is valid  theories of macroeconomic history 
dependence will have to be based either on interest rate multiplicities rooted in the lack

occupational choice mechanisms

To prove this  apply Observations   and   By Observation   and our restriction on 
   t       for all t     Now using Observation   we may conclude that at all dates 
some of the high people stay high  while some of the low people stay low  This is enough to 
establish the result 
Thus along any competitive equilibrium  no dynasty will strictly prefer to switch skills 
though it may well be the case that it strictly prefers to stay where it is  Lemma   yields

with equality holding whenever a switch from  high  to  low  does occur along the 
equilibrium path  Invoking   of Lemma   we get half of   as well as  
The same argument applied to a currently low dynasty gets us the other half of   and 
 
The next step is central

Proof  It suffices to prove the result for t     I first show that 
  max B 
 
 
    B 
Suppose this assertion is false  Then I claim that there exists a first date T     such that 
             T and 
  BT   
 
   
 T 
Of course  if B     
 
  the claim is automatically true  otherwise B     
 
  We 
also have  by virtue of the presumption that   does not hold  that B      so 
that 
 
   
    B   
 
 
 
  The Dynamics of Inequality 
which   by Lemma     implies that       Moreover  B    b     B    b     B 
while B    b     B  so that 
B    B

and simple manipulation of this equality shows that 
  B    B   
     
 
 
where     B    B       again  by the failure of  
Following the same reasoning leading up to   as long as Bt     
 
 t    and as 
long as this is also true of all dates before t   we have              t    t  and 
  Bt    Bt  
     
 
 
It follows that there must be a first date T such that              T  and   holds  as 
claimed 
On the other hand    cannot hold with strict inequality  as this would surely violate 
  of Lemma   so it must be that 
  BT   
 
   
 T 
In turn  this means that  T     T  see   Moreover   BT    BT    b T  so that

    BT    BT    
which contradicts   at date T     This establishes  
Now we prove that 
  B    min B 
 
   
 
The argument runs closely parallel to the previous one  Suppose   is false  Then I claim 
that there exists a first date T     such that              T and 
  BT   
 
 
 T 
The steps are very similar to those used to establish   and are omitted 
Continuing the parallel argument    cannot hold with strict inequality  so we have 
  BT   
 
 
 T 
In turn  this means that  T     T  These two observations establish  however  that 
 BT     T     
The Dynamics of Inequality  
 following steps parallel to those establishing   which contradicts   and completes 
the proof of the lemma 
The following observation is a simple consequence of Lemma  
Lemma   Along any equilibrium  if B t     t  then Bt     t  Similarly  if 
B t     
 
 t  then Bt

Proof  We prove the first part  the second part uses a completely analogous argument  If 
B t     t  then max B t   t     t  so that by    t   
Bt  On the other hand  Lemma   tells us that  t    Bt  and the proof is complete 
With these steps in hand  we may complete the proof of the theorem  There are three 
possibilities to consider  each a restriction on the initial value  
I      B     
 
  Then by   B    B  In particular 
    B     
 
 
so that by Lemma         Continuing the argument recursively  we see that  t     for 
all t 
II  B      Then by Lemma   B      and so by Lemma        
Suppose  in fact  that strict inequality holds  Then       and  
 
   
 
 
  so that 
   
 
    B     
Now I claim that in fact 
   
 
    B     
Suppose not  First suppose that B      Then by Lemma   B      so 
that B         B     B      which contradicts   In exactly the same way 
one can rule out the possibility that B     
 
  so   is established 
Now we are in Case I  and   must remain constant thereafter  So in Case II  we move to a 
steady state in at most one step 
III  B     
 
  Then by Lemma   B     
 
  and so by Lemma        
To bring out the contrast with Case II  I claim that B     
 
  with strict inequality 
if the corresponding inequality at date   also holds strictly 
Suppose on the contrary that B     
 
  Then 
  B     
 
     
 
    B 
while it is also true that 
  B     
 
     
 
    B 
But   and   together contradict the fact that B         B     B 
  The Dynamics of Inequality 
If strict inequality holds at date  B     
 
  then we can arrive at a contradiction 
simply under the weaker condition B     
 
  For then       and therefore 
 because       it must be that       Therefore the weak inequality in   holds 
strictly  and we obtain the same contradiction 
So the claim is established and we can apply Case III repeatedly to argue that  t     t for 
all t in this case 
Moreover  if B     
 
  then B t     
 
 t  for all t subsequently  so convergence 
cannot ever occur in finite time  in contrast to the  one-step  property of Case II 
Finally  observe that in the case B     
 
  in which  t     t for all t  there is no 
t and no      t 
   t  which is a steady state  For suppose there were  then in particular 
 
    B  so that 
 
 
 t   
 
    B    B t    Bt 
where the very last inequality follows from the fact that  s    s  for all s  But  
contradicts the equilibrium condition   This proves that in Case III  convergence 
occurs to the smallest steady state to the right of  
Proof of Observation   Let Wt denote the wealth of a typical member of generation t  We 
claim that if Wt    Wt 
  Ws    Ws for all s   t  Suppose not  then there exist dates  
and s with s     such that  a W    W   b  Ws    Ws 
  and  c  Wm   W    Ws for all 
intermediate dates     m   s this last requirement is  of course  vacuous in case s    
But then a strictly higher wealth  W  compared to Ws  generates a strictly lower descendant 
wealth  W  compared to Ws  which contradicts a familiar  single-crossing  argument 
based on the strict concavity of the utility function  Therefore dynastic wealth converges in 
this case 
Next suppose that Wt    Wt 
  Then a reversal of the same logic implies that family wealth 
is nondecreasing across generations

To prepare for the proofs of the remaining propositions  we record several lemmas  and we 
presume  often implicitly  that  R   E  and  LP  apply where needed 
Lemma   In the Becker-Tomes benchmark  for every w     and r

W   W  w r    W 
 b   w r  is nondecreasing in w 
 c   w r  is continuous at every  w r  at which it is finite

instance  W   W  w r    W    w r  or if W   W  w r     w r    W  limit wealth starting from 
W can never equal  w r  This proves the first assertion in part  a  the second assertion 
follows in similar fashion 
Part  b  We claim first that W   W  w r  is nondecreasing in w  To show this  it suffices to 
assume that W    w  but then it must be the case that

must  strictly intersect the

assures us that  w r  must be locally continuous 
  The Dynamics of Inequality 
Lemma   For any steady state wage function 
 a  If h is inhabited  x h    x h 
 
  implies w h    w h 
 
 
 b  If h is inhabited  then x h    x h 
 
  implies w h    w h 
 
        r x h    x h 
 
 
Proof  If  a  is false and x h    x h 
 
  while w h    w h 
 
  then any parent selecting occupation 
h for her child would do better to select occupation h 
 
instead  The same is true if  b  were 
false  the parent could switch to occupation h 
 
for the child  combined with a higher financial 
bequest so as to leave the child s wealth unaffected  while increasing her own consumption 
As in the main text  it will often be convenient to write the wage as a function of training 
cost  w x  Part  a  of Lemma   informs us that we can certainly do this right away for 
inhabited training costs 
Lemma    a  The set of all inhabited training costs   call it T   is a subset of   X  of full 
measure  and w is continuous on T 
 b  There is a unique continuous extension of w on T to all of   X  and it forms an equivalent 
representation 
Proof  Part  a  Let T be the set of all inhabited training costs  Since a steady state must 
have positive output by definition  it follows from  R  and  E  that T must be of full measure 
Moreover  w  viewed as a function of x  must be continuous on T  For if not  we can select 
training costs x and x 
 
in T that are arbitrarily close  but such that their wage difference is 
bounded away from zero  In that case no parent would select the  almost identical  training 
cost with a lower wage 
Part  b  Because w is nondecreasing on T and T is of full measure  there is a unique 
continuous extension of w x  to all of   X  Use this extension to define w h  for all 
occupations  inhabited or not  That is  w h    w h  if h is inhabited  and equals the continuous 
extension otherwise  We first claim that w h    w h  for all h that are uninhabited  For if not 
we have a contradiction in a manner similar to part  a  we can find an inhabited occupation 
h 
  arbitrarily close to h but with wages bounded below that of w h  which means that all 
occupiers of h 
  would prefer h  a contradiction 
By this claim  if we replace w by w    no firm will wish to change its desired input mix  unused 
inputs have not become any cheaper  To complete the proof of equivalence  observe that no 
family occupying h 
  finds it strictly profitable to switch to an uninhabited occupation h once 
its wage has been replaced by w h  For if this were true  then by the definition of continuous 
extension we can find a third inhabited occupation h 
  with wage and training cost arbitrarily 
close to that of h  such that the family must therefore also find it profitable to switch from h 
 
to h 
  But this is a contradiction  since that option is already available in the going steady 
state 
 This argument  as well as its counterpart for  a  can be made entirely precise by showing that the preference 
for h over h 
 
can be made uniform over all families  irrespective of their wealth 
The Dynamics of Inequality  
In what follows we focus exclusively on this equivalent representation and call it w instead 
of w    Define w   w 
Lemma   Every family attains a wealth of at least  w r 
Proof  Let W be the steady state wealth of some family  Suppose that it incurs training 
cost x and leaves bequest b  then by stationarity  W       r b   w x  Now  given the choice 
of x  b must maximize 
  U W   x   b    V w x        r b 
subject to b     Defining B   b   x  this can equivalently be written as  B is chosen to 
maximize 
  U W   B    V w 
        r B 
subject to B   w x  where w 
    w x        r x  It is obvious that the solution to this problem 
involves a total bequest B at least as large as the value that would obtain if the constraint 
B   w x  were replaced by B     i e  if we were in a Becker-Tomes benchmark world with w 
 
and r  Remembering that W is also next period s wealth in the problem   we conclude 
that 
  W   W   W  w 
 
 r 
We now claim that 
  W    w 
 
 r 
If this is false  then W    w 
 
 r  Combining this with   we may conclude that 
W   W  w 
 
 r    W    w 
 
 r  but this contradicts part  a  of Lemma  
Now recall the definition of w 
  and invoke part  b  of Lemma   to conclude that w 
    w 
Use this fact and part  b  of Lemma   to observe that  w 
 
 r     w r  Combine this last 
inequality with   to obtain the desired result 
Lemma   Let W be any lower bound on stationary wealth across all families 
 a  If for any occupation h  we have w       r x h    W  then w h    w       r x h 
 b  The stationary wealth of any family selecting an occupation h with w       r x h    W must be 
 w r 
Proof  Part  a  Suppose  on the contrary  that w       r x h    W  but w h    w       r x h 
By Lemma   part  b  and the fact that w is a continuous equivalent representation  it must 
be that 
w h    w       r x h 
so that for some x 
    x h  but close to it 
  w x 
 
    w       r x 
 
 
Now  we know that there is a sequence of inhabited occupations  h 
k 
  such that x h 
k 
      By 
assumption  W is a lower bound on stationary wealth across all families  and w       r x 
   
  The Dynamics of Inequality 
w       r x h    W  Therefore  for k large enough  such families are almost exclusively 
leaving financial bequests of magnitude at least x 
 
to their children at rate of return r  They 
would be better off  instead  selecting an occupation with cost x 
 
for their children  which 
yields a return of strictly more than r  by   and supplementing the remainder with 
financial bequests  a contradiction 
For each family selecting occupation h with w       r x h    W  we have w h    w      
r x h  Therefore the realized rate of return to all the choices of such a family  financial and 
educational  is exactly r  Define x  by 
  w       r x    W 
Once again  using Lemma   part  b  and the fact that w is a continuous equivalent 
representation  we also know that wages for training costs beyond x  yield no less a return 
than r for all educational investments beyond x  Yet these families choose  by part  a  not to 
utilize such regions of educational investment  They must therefore be behaving in exactly 
the same way as in a Becker-Tomes benchmark world with parameters  w r  We must 
conclude that their stationary wealth equals  w r 
Lemma   In an equal steady state  the common wealth of all families must be  w r  and 
 w r    w   X    r 
Proof  Let W denote the  common  wealth of each family in an equal steady state  We 
claim that 
  W   w       r X 
For if not  we know from Lemma   part  b   and the fact that w is a continuous equivalent 
representation  that there are inhabited occupations with training costs x arbitrarily close to 
X  and that 
w x    w       r x 
Consequently  if   were to be false  we would find inhabited occupations with w h    W 
Because the wealth of families in such occupations is at least w h  this is a contradiction to 
equality 
It remains to prove that W    w r  Because   is true  and because W is  trivially 
a lower bound on stationary wealth  Lemma   part  b  applies to all families  and 
W    w r 
Lemma   A steady state is equal if and only if the continuous equivalent representation of the 
wage function is linear 
  w h    w       r x h 
for all occupations h 
Proof  For necessity  combine Lemma   part  a  and Lemma   For sufficiency  note 
that if   holds  then we are in a Becker-Tomes benchmark world and all limit wealths 
must be the same 
The Dynamics of Inequality  
The remaining steps concern unequal steady states  Define   by 
  w       r     w r 
Lemma   In an unequal steady state  it must be that     X 
Proof  By Lemma    w r  is a lower bound on stationary wealth for all families  If 
contrary to our assertion      X  then part  a  of Lemma   applies for every training cost 
when W is replaced by  w r  Therefore w satisfies   and the sufficiency direction of 
Lemma   implies that the steady state must be equal  a contradiction 
We are interested in the shape of w in the region U     X 
Lemma   Let I be some subinterval of U such that no financial bequests are made by any family 
that occupies some occupation with training cost in U  Then w satisfies   on I 
Proof  Fix any x   I  with x   sup I  For       but small enough  x       I as well 
Assume provisionally that both x and x     are inhabited  Then family wealth at x  resp 
x     is merely w x   resp  w x     Using the two optimality conditions  one for families 
with wealth w x  and the other for families with wealth w x     we see that 
  U w x x U w x x    V w x V w x    U w x x U w x x 
Now  using the fact that w is a continuous equivalent representation  and invoking  R  and 
 E  we can see that   actually applies to all x and x     in I  not just those that are 
inhabited 
Dividing these terms throughout by   applying the concavity of the utility function to the 
two side terms  and the mean value theorem to the central term  we see that 
U 
 
 w x     x       V 
 
 w x       w x 
 
  U 
 
 w x       x 
where   lies between w x  and w x     Now send   to zero and use the continuous 
differentiability of U and V to conclude that the right-hand derivative of w with respect to x 
  call it w 
 x    exists  and 
w 
 
 x    U 
 
 w x    x V 
 
 w x 
By exactly the same argument applied to x  greater than infI  and x     we may conclude 
the same of the left-hand derivative  which verifies  
Lemma   Any two-phase wage function has w 
 x        r for almost all x    
Proof  The continuous differentiability of U and V  and the continuity of w together 
imply that w is continuously differentiable in its second phase  where it follows   Note 
moreover that w 
 
        r  Therefore  if the assertion is false  there is an interval  x  x 
with x      on which w 
 
 x     r  while w 
 
 x     r and w x r x      Applying 
 Given  R  and  E  we can approach both x and x     by a sequence of inhabited training cost pairs in I  and 
for each such pair the inequality   holds 
 One way to assure the existence of an interval with all these properties is to take x  to be the minimum of the 
values among those greater than   for which w 
 
 x        r

Define w    w x        r x  which is nonnegative by construction  Then   reduces to

By the same logic as   except that at x  we have w

 w x 
Now observe that w x        r x    x    w x   because w 
 
 x        r on  x  x  or 
equivalently  using the definition of w  x   
w x w

  Consequently 
w x    x

 w x 
Suppose that w x      Then   means that w x  is a positive limit wealth in the BeckerTomes 
benchmark with  w r  while Lemma   tells us that W   w x  w r    w x  Because 
w x    w x  this means that w x  cannot be a limit wealth starting from initial wealth 
w x  This contradicts  LP 
On the other hand  if w x      then w     and       as well  which means that  r     
the limit of Becker-Tomes wealth from all positive initial wealths is zero when w     But 
this fact is contradicted by Lemma   applied to   because w  is also   in this case 
If a wage function satisfies w x    w x 
 
        r x   x 
 
  for all x and x 
 
in some interval  say 
that it is r-linear over that interval  We know  for instance  that any two-phase wage function 
with a nondegenerate first phase indeed r-linear over    w 
Lemma   Suppose that a family in steady state  inhabiting training cost x at some date  also 
makes a financial bequest at that date  That is  it possesses  and bequeaths  total wealth W  where 
W   w x  Then w is r-linear over all x    x with w x        r x

by Lemma   part  b  and the fact that w is a continuous equivalent representation  we

Figure   Proof of Lemma  
The next lemma summarizes what we know so far about an unequal steady state 
Lemma   The continuous equivalent-representation of any unequal steady state wage function 
is r-linear up to   followed by combinations of intervals over which either the differential equation 
  is obeyed  or r-linearity holds 
Proof  Combine Lemmas   and  
However  we now establish a stronger property 
Lemma   In an unequal steady state  the continuous  equivalent-representation wage function 
must be two-phase 
Proof  Let w be a  continuous  steady state wage function  starting from w  Denote by 
w 
the two-phase wage function starting from the same point  We know already that the 
two functions coincide at least up to   Suppose  contrary to the assertion  that w

for some x     X  Then there is some first r-linear segment  after    at which w departs 
from w 
 
By Lemma   w must lie below w 
in this segment  Use Figure   as a guide in what 
follows 
Pick some inhabited x in the interior of the r-linear segment  then pick x

w x        r x and rate of return r  By  LP  applied to this benchmark  a family with starting 
wealth W    w x      in this benchmark world must converge to the very same limit wealth

Proof of Proposition   Lemma   establishes that there is a continuous equivalent 
representation to the wage function in every steady state  Lemma   shows that in any 
equal steady state   w r    w       r x  where w is the lowest wage in that steady state 
wage function  Lemma   shows that the wage function must be r-linear for equal steady 
states  Lemma   shows that unequal steady state wage functions must have the twophase 
property  it is r-linear up to   which is defined in   and follows the differential 
equation   thereafter  Lemma   shows that the second phase must exhibit a rate of 
return that is almost everywhere higher than r 
Proof of Observation   The differential equation   in the exponential utility case reduces 
to 
  w

  exp x 
from which the stated result follows  Applying   to the constant elasticity case  we see 
that for all x

 x  increases just to the right of   while   using     w x x monotonically 
falls  But it must be the case throughout that w x x continues to exceed w 
 
 x  otherwise the 
very changes described in this paragraph cannot occur to begin with  Therefore w 
 
 x  rises 
throughout  establishing strict convexity to the right of  
The Dynamics of Inequality  
However  w 
 
cannot go to   as another perusal of   will readily reveal  Indeed  w 
 
converges to a finite limit  which is computed by setting both w 
 
 x  and w x x equal to the 
same value in  
Proof of Proposition   The necessity of  P  is obvious  given the characterization in 
Proposition   so we establish sufficiency 
Index each two-phase wage function w by its starting wage w  and define c 
 
 w    c r  w 
Condition P assures us that c 
 
 w      for some w  We claim that c 
 
 w      for some w 
Suppose not  then c 
 
 w      for all w  Send w     then to maintain c 
 
 w      it must be 
that the associated cost-minimizing     call it  w    converges weakly to   Fix any k    
Then for w large enough   E  implies that 
f k   w k   r 
For all such w  concavity of f in k tells us that the associated cost-minimizing capital input 
k w  must be bounded  But now the continuity of f  together with  E  atells us that output 
goes to zero as w     which contradicts unit cost minimization  This proves the claim 
Because c 
 
is continuous  there exists w 
  between w  and w  such that c 
 
 w 
 
     
We prove that the two-phase wage function w emanating from w 
 
satisfies all the conditions 
for a steady state wage function  To this end  we specify a steady state wealth and bequest 
distribution  and occupational choice 
First  let  
  be the input mix associated with the supporting wage function w  Arrange the 
population over occupations according to  
 
  Let      w 
 
 
If a family i is assigned to occupation h with x h      set that family s wealth equal to  w 
 
 r 
its educational bequest equal to x h  and its financial bequest equal to  w 
 
 r x h r 
Otherwise  if occupational assignment h has x h      set that family s wealth equal to 
w 
 
 x h  its educational bequest equal to x h  and its financial bequest equal to  
To complete the proof  we must show that each family chooses an optimal bequest  First pick 
a family located at occupation h with x   x h      Because w  has a slope of at least  r in x 
this family has no need to make financial bequests  Let M x  x 
 
    U w x    x 
 
    V w x 
 
  be 
this family s expected payoff from leaving an educational bequest x 
 
  and let N x    M x  x 
Then N is differentiable and it is easy to see that

 This is a consequence of the maximum theorem and the assumption that production is continuous in the weak 
topology over occupational distributions on H

Now consider a family located at x       We know that its total wealth equals  w 
 
 r   
w    w x  for all x     so by a standard single-crossing argument  and the observations of 
the previous paragraph  that family will never bequeath more than   Therefore this family 
must behave just as in a Becker-Tomes benchmark world with prices  w 
 
 r  so its assigned 
bequest in optimal 
Proof of Proposition   Suppose  on the contrary  that there are two steady state wage 
functions  modulo equivalent representations  Denote these by w  and w  and observe 
from Proposition   that each of them must belong to the two-phase family  Let w  and w 
be the two baseline wages  and let  i    wi  for i       Without loss of generality suppose 
that      
These two wage functions must cross  otherwise if the profit-maximization  support 
condition is satisfied at one of them it will not be satisfied at the other  Beyond   both 
wage functions satisfy the same differential equation   which rules out a crossing in 
this region  The functions also cannot cross below   since both wage functions are r-linear 
in this region  So       and the functions cross at some x       
Now proceed as in the proof of Lemma   Pick some x in  x    inhabited under w  then 
pick x 
     x  x  such that w x 
 
    w x

but this contradicts the fact that w  satisfies   at x 
 
 
Proof of Observation   Condition P tells us that for some two-phase wage function w 
c r  w      Define a new wage function w  that is r-linear from the same baseline wage as 
that for w  then by Lemma   w x    w x  for all x  It follows that c r  w        as well  The 
existence of the required baseline wage a now follows from the same argument used in the 
proof of Proposition  
Proof of Proposition   First assume that   fails  using the same technique as in the 
proof of Proposition   it is easy to see that the r-linear wage function starting at a is an 
equal steady state  Given Proposition   this completes the proof 
Indeed  by the characterization result of proposition   an equal steady state wage function 
must be the wage function that starts at a  If  therefore    holds  that proposition assures 
us that an equal steady state cannot exist 
  Informal Observations on Equilibrium Dynamics   This section needs rewriting 
to harmonize notation and cross-references with the material discussed earlier  What follows 
has been extracted from Mookherjee and Ray  AER  
We now turn to the question of non-steady state dynamics  The basic ideas are simple 
though the details are complicated and thus suppressed below  A distribution of wealth 
 past bequests plus current income  prevails at any date  this will map into a distribution 
of wealth for the next generation  Of course  the analysis will be different depending on 
whether condition   holds or fails  and in addition there are several different kinds of 
initial conditions to consider  We report on a single case  but one that holds particular 
interest  We assume that initial wealth is perfectly equally distributed  yet we suppose that a 
steady state is incompatible with perfect equality  i e  that   holds 
Begin  then  with a single wealth level which we shall call W  commonly held by every 
member of generation   The key to understanding the dynamics is the following simple 
but powerful observation 
Observation   Suppose that next period s wage function is given by w  with lowest wage 
 
w 
  Let W     W 
 
w 
  Then for every x such that w x    W  it must be the case that 
w x   
 
w        r x 
This follows from similar arguments made earlier  the rate of return on educational 
investment must equal r over the entire range spanned by financial bequests for any given 
occupation  Observation   has an interesting corollary 
Observation   For any N  there exists a threshold such that starting from any equal initial wealth 
above this threshold  there is perfect equality for at least N generations 
To see this  recall the wage function w 
 
constructed earlier   For any N  define a threshold 
  call it W    such that if W    W    then  N 
 W

iterated N times  In words  we choose an initial wealth high enough so that N iterations 
will not suffice to bring wealth down to w 
 
  in the pure bequest model with baseline wage 
 
w 
 
  If the wage function for the next N periods is given by w 
  this is perfectly consistent 
with equilibrium behavior for those N periods  All occupations are equally valuable  so 
individuals are indifferent over these choices  Moreover  there will be full equality over this 
epoch 
Observation   implies that this is the only possible outcome for the first N periods  Any 
other candidate wage function would have to exhibit a return of r over occupations in 
which the wage fell short of wealth  This implies right away that no other equilibrium 
wage function can exist with the same starting wage 
 
w 
 
  Using Observation   again and 
employing an argument similar to that used to establish uniqueness  we may also rule out 
any candidate wage function with a different starting wage than 
 
w 
 
 
So perfect equality can prevail for a substantial number of periods  But   if   holds  
it cannot prevail forever  Because  
 
w 
 
    w 
 
  there must eventually come a date T when 
the recursion  
 T 
 W 
 
w 
 
  dips below w 
 
  At this stage  the symmetry of equilibrium is 
broken and the economy must depart from the wage function w 
  If not  all occupations 
with wages that exceed  
 T 
 W 
 
w 
 
  would remain unoccupied  This cannot be  the wages 
of such occupations must rise  yielding rates of return that exceed their counterpart on 
financial bequests  For all other occupations  Observation   is applicable in full force  and 
the occupational rate of return remains anchored to the financial rate 
Figure   describes the resulting  distortion  in the wage function  The diagram displays 
N initial periods in which the wage function w  prevails  and there is no inequality  At date 
N  wealth dips into the support of w 
  and no occupation more expensive than xN can be 
The Dynamics of Inequality  
supported under the old rates of return  The economy must react by lowering the wages of 
all occupations below xN  and by raising the rates of return to all other occupations  These 
higher rates encourage the acquisition of such professions  and in so doing must generate 
inequality  Of course  all generation-N individuals are still indifferent between the various 
choices  But this is the last generation for which all payoffs are equal  The higher rates of 
return on the more expensive occupations must inevitably result in inequality among the 
next generation 
Once such inequality sets in  it will not go away  Familiar single-crossing arguments 
guarantee that descendants of higher-wealth individuals must occupy the richer professions 
and receive higher payoffs  The subsequent dynamics are complicated by the fact that the 
wealth distribution is no longer degenerate  In the special case where there are just two 
occupations  involving different training costs  it can be shown that the economy converges 
to an unequal steady state  with inequality rising over time  Moreover  the rise in inequality 
is augmented in the presence of financial bequests  it turns out that individuals in the 
unskilled occupation at any date are less wealthy than their parents  and make smaller 
financial bequests to their children than they received 
In the continuum case  the wealth distribution at any date must retain a mass point at its 
lower bound  and it is this mass point which will be spread over all the  low  occupations 
which continue to bear the financial rate of return r  In the relatively  high  occupations  the 
rate of return will continue its departure from r  attracting more individuals into this zone 
Figure   illustrates this with yet another iteration for date N   The new wage function is 
given by the dashed curve  It must be linear  with slope     r  up to the new threshold xN 
and then rises even more steeply than before  intersecting both the previous wage functions 
from below  This rise induces some fresh symmetry-breaking  as new dynasties from the 
 cheap  occupations seek the higher rates of return  If this process converges  a subject of 
our current research  it must be to precisely the steady state we have described earlier  At 
this steady state  there is a mass point of individuals with identical wealth  and among such 
individuals there is a simple tradeoff between occupational choice and financial bequests 
among which they are indifferent  But there will also be a positive measure of individuals 
arrayed over varying levels of wealth  and utility 
 
CHAPTER  
Polarization and Conflict 
As the struggle proceeds  the whole society breaks up more and more into 
two hostile camps  two great  directly antagonistic classes  bourgeoisie 
and proletariat  The classes polarize  so that they become internally more 
homogeneous and more and more sharply distinguished from one another 
in wealth and power   Morton Deutsch   
  Introduction 
Conflict is a fundamental part of life in many developing countries  This section of the 
course will try to set up models of conflict and also study its correlates 
Some basic facts  between   battle deaths in   interstate wars were approximately 
 m  Compared to that  deaths in civil wars have totalled around  m  Such wars have 
been experienced in   states  with a median duration of six years  In   there were  
ongoing conflicts  It is reasonable to say that matters have only become worse in the twenty 
first century 
These numbers are symptomatic of ongoing unrest  violence around the world  They 
obviously have big effects for GDP and growth  one writer places the narrow economic 
costs of conflict at around   of GDP 
By conflict we don t just mean violent conflict  Demonstrations  strikes  processions  all of 
these also cause a substantial amount of economic waste 
One sort of conflict may simply come from class antagonisms  the presence of rich and 
poor subclasses in the population  This is classic redistributive conflict where redistribution 
occurs  or is sought  from rich to poor  But it has also been argued that  ethnic divisions 
  broadly defined   may be a significant determinant of conflict  For instance  writers 
such as Samuel Huntington   have argued for a cultural perspective on conflict and 
war  After all  there is no particular reason why redistribution must occur across economic 
classes  It could happen between religious  ethnic  or spatially separated groups  Resources 
are resources  no matter where they come from 
  Polarization and Conflict 
The monumental threatise on ethnic conflict is by Donald Horowitz   who summarizes 
thus 
 The Marxian concept of class as an inherited and determinative affiliation 
finds no support in  the  data  Marx s conception applies with far less 
distortion to ethnic groups  Ethnic membership us generally given at birth 
      and have considerable power to generate conflict      
In much of Asia and Africa  it is only modest hyperbole to assert that 
the Marxian prophecy has had an ethnic fulfillment 
As I ve said above  this doesn t mean that ethnicity is necessarily a  primordial  or intrinsic 
source of conflict  Ethnicity may simply be a relevant marker for carving out a larger 
share of a smaller pie  Very often  ethnic groups are not particularly ranked by income 
Sinhalese Tamils in Sri Lanka  Malays Chinese in Malaysia  Hausa Yoruba in Nigeria 
Serbs Muslims in Bosnia  Dalits low-income-Muslims in Gujarat  Basques others in Spain 
In other situations  marked socio-economic differences do exist  Hutu Tutsi in Rwanda 
and Burundi  caste divisions in Bihar  Bengalis in pre-Bangladesh Pakistan  Muslims in the 
Philippines  Kurds in Iraq  Sikhs in the Punjab  or the Naxalites in Eastern and SouthEastern 
India 
Some interesting questions 
What sort of distributions make for conflict 
Distributions over what   Ethnic groups or income classes  The answer would presumably 
depend on what the salient marker is for conflict 
How might we decide whether unranked ethnicity or ranked class is salient in conflict 
  What Creates Conflict 
  Variables  Much  though not all  of the empirical literature on conflict throws in the 
kitchen sink to see what washes up  On the left hand side goes in one of several alternative 
dependent variables  many measures of  conflict  ranging all the way from incidence of 
demonstrations  procesions  or strikes  through riots and on to civil war 
Even with a specific choice such as civil war  used here  we need defining criteria  see SingerSmall 
  Licklider   Doyle-Sambanis   Fearon-Laitin   One important 
distinction to be made is between onset and incidence  Did the conflict start in that year of 
measurement  or was it ongoing  As we will see later this makes a big difference  Another 
important question is the minimum number of deaths before a conflict is classifiable as such 
for civil wars  this is a matter of ongoing debate 
On the right hand-side goes in a slew of explanatory variables 
Economic  per-capita income  inequality of income or wealth  resource holdings      
Geographical  mountainous terrain  separation from capital city      
Polarization and Conflict  
Political   extent of democracy  prior war      
And  of course 
Ethnic  Measures of ethnolinguistic diversity drawn from the World Christian Encyclopedia 
Encyclopedia Britannica  Atlas NarodovMira  CIA FactBook  Measures of religious diversity 
drawn from L Etat des Religions dans le Monde  World Christian Encyclopedia  The 
Statesman s Yearbook 
This last information is typically put into an index of diversity  An index with particularly 
wide currency is the ethnolinguistic fractionalization index  or ELF  of course  there s nothing 
to stop its use for religious diversity as well 
To define this  say there are M groups  nj 
is the population share of group j  Then 
E  
X 
M

nj    nj 
This has an obvious relationship to the Gini index of inequality if we take inter-group 
distance to be equal to one 
ELF is widely used in empirical work  see Taylor and Hudson   Mauro  Easterly 
and Levine   Alesina et al    Vigdor   Collier and Hoeffler   Fearon 
and Laiton   and many others 
  Some Findings  Perhaps the most robust finding in many different empirical studies 
is that per-capita income is negatively related to conflict  A negative and significant 
association is to be observed in the cross-sectional studies carried out by Collier and Hoeffler 
  Fearon and Laitin   Montalvo and Reynal-Querol   and several others  As 
Fearon and Laitin   summarize 
 Per capita income  measured as thousands of   U S  dollars and lagged 
one year  is strongly significant in both a statistical and a substantive sense 
       
It hardly needs mentioning that no causal inference can be drawn from such an association 
Relatively speaking  the best study that addresses this question is Miguel  Satyanath 
and Sergenti   which instruments for GDP growth shocks using rainfall  Such an 
instrunment would be unacceptably weak in many of the richer developing countries  so 
they restrict attention to a sample of   sub-Saharan African countries over the period 
 -  Their main results are best summarized in their own words 
 Using the comprehensive new database of conflicts developed by the 
International Peace Research Institute of Oslo  Norway  and the University 
of Uppsala  Sweden  we find that GDP growth is significantly negatively 
related to the incidence of civil conflict in sub-Saharan Africa during the 
period   across a range of regression specifications  including some 
with country fixed effects  The relationship between GDP growth and the 
incidence of civil wars is extremely strong  a five-percentage-point drop 
  Polarization and Conflict 
in annual economic growth increases the likelihood of a civil conflict  at 
least   deaths per year  in the following year by over   percentage points 
  which amounts to an increase of more than one-half in the likelihood 
of civil war  Other variables that have gained prominence in the recent 
literature   per capita GDP level  democracy  ethnic diversity  and oil 
exporter status   do not display a similarly robust relationship with the 
incidence of civil wars in sub-Saharan Africa  In the second main result 
we find   perhaps surprisingly   that the impact of income shocks on 
civil conflict is not significantly different in richer  more democratic  more 
ethnically diverse  or more mountainous African countries or in countries 
with a range of different political institutional characteristics 
To be sure  the exclusion restriction behind the use of rainfall as an instrument could be 
violated if rainfall has some direct effect on conflict via some other pathway  For instance 
floods could destroy the road network and make it harder to contain government troops 
  more conflict  though this is a bias that runs the other way from the instrumental 
direction  which may actually strengthen the results  But of course  one could cook up 
other connections  such as floods make it harder for government troops and rebels to engage 
each other  which reduces conflict  in terms of deaths  The authors attempt to take care of 
some of these effects in the paper 
What lies behind the connection behind poverty and conflict  What comes to mind most 
immediately is the fact that poverty reduces the opportunity cost of conflict labor  making 
it easier to use labor for some other activity  Of course  with poverty all around there may 
not be much to appropriate  so this suggests that it might be more interesting to examine the 
effects of  growth shocks inequality 
Some evidence that opportunity costs lie at the heart of the story comes from the paper 
by Dube and Vargas   which studies the effect of coffee and oil prices on conflict in 
Colombia  Oil prices affect government revenues which are there to be grabbed  so one 
would imagine that higher prices for oil positively affect conflict  In contrast  if coffeegrowing 
is an economic activity that competes with resources given over to conflict  such 
as labor  then an increase in coffee prices would reduce conflict  Thus if the opportunity 
cost story is right  one would expect that oil and coffee have opposite effects on conflict  and 
indeed this is what Dube and Vargas find 
The opportunity cost argument is explicitly made by Collier and Hoeffler   though 
it is fairly obvious and appears implicitly in many papers  In contrast  Fearon and laitin 
  have argued that poverty is likely correlated with low government capabilities and 
infrastructure that makes it harder to crack down on insurgencies  In support of this line 
of reasoning they show that  mountainous terrain  is significant in  explaining  conflict 
showing thereby that infrastructure and geography matter  This line of argument requires 
more investigation  however 
A second important finding is that the inequality of income appears to have at best an 
ambiguous effect on conflict  Some early papers on this subject are Nagel   for Vietnam 
Midlarski   and Muller  Seligson and Fu    the last two are on land inequalities 
Specifically  under several measures of inequality such as the Gini  conflict appears to be 
Polarization and Conflict  
low both for low and for high values of inequality  This is a theme to which we will return 
in more detail below 
As a related matter  we ve already noted that measures of ethnic dispersion are closely 
related to  inequality    i e  diversity   across ethnic groups  These  too  fail to matter 
The same findings appear and reappear in Collier and Hoeffler     Fearon and 
Laitin   as well as Miguel et al   Fearon and Laitin   conclude thus 
 The estimates for the effect of ethnic and religious fractionalization are 
substantively and statistically insignificant       The empirical pattern is thus 
inconsistent with       the common expectation that ethnic diversity is a 
major and direct cause of civil violence 
This isn t to say that ethnic or religious fractionalization cannot indirectly affect conflict  It 
might  via reduced GDP  Alesina et al    reduced GDP growth  Easterly and Levine 
  or poor governance  Mauro   The claim really is that there is no direct effect 
An important theme that we pursue below is the development of a measure of  polarization 
which we show is different from inequality  Is a Gini-like index like ELF a good measure 
Listen to Horowitz again 
 I have intimated at various points that a system with only two ethnic 
parties       is especially conflict prone       In dispersed systems  group 
loyalties are parochial  and ethnic conflict is localized  it  could put one 
of a series of watertight compartments out of order  but it could not make 
the ship of state sink         The demands of one group can sometimes be 
granted without injuring the interests of others        
On the other hand  continues Horowitz 
 A centrally focused system  with few groupings  possesses fewer cleavages 
than a dispersed system  but those it possesses run through the whole 
society and are of greater magnitude  When conflict occurs  the center has 
little latitude to placate some groups without antagonizing others 
The conflictual power of broad cleavages is of course an older theme  read the quotation at 
the beginning of this chapter 
  The Identity-Alienation Framework 
Following Esteban and Ray     and Duclos  Esteban and Ray   I develop 
below the identification-alienation framework  The idea is simple  polarization is related to 
the alienation that individuals and groups feel from one another  but such alienation is fuelled 
by notions of within-group identity  In concentrating on such phenomena  I do not mean to 
suggest that instances in which a single isolated individual runs amok with a machine gun 
are rare  or that they are unimportant in the larger scheme of things  It is just that these are 
not the objects of our enquiry  We are interested in the correlates of organized  large-scale 
social unrest   strikes  demonstrations  processions  widespread violence  and revolt or 
  Polarization and Conflict 
rebellion  Such phenomena thrive on differences  to be sure  But they cannot exist without 
notions of group identity either 
This brief discussion immediately suggests that inequality  inasmuch as it concerns itself with 
interpersonal alienation  captures but one aspect of polarization  To be sure  there are some 
obvious changes that would be branded as both inequality- and polarization-enhancing 
For instance  if two income groups are further separated by increasing economic distance 
inequality and polarization would presumably both increase  However  local equalizations 
of income differences at two different ranges of the income distribution will most likely lead 
to two better-defined groups   each with a clearer sense of itself and the other  In this case 
inequality will have come down but polarization may be on the rise 
Imagine  then  that society is divided into  groups   economic  social  religious  spatial 
Identity  There is  homogeneity  within each group 
Alienation  There is  heterogeneity  across groups 
The IA framework presumes that such a situation is inherently conflictual  In the words of 
Esteban and Ray  
 We begin with the obvious question  why are we interested in polarization 
It is our contention that the phenomenon of polarization is closely 
linked to the generation of tensions  to the possibilities of articulated 
rebellion and revolt  and to the existence of social unrest in general       At 
the same time  measured inequality in such a society may be low 
Does the standard theory of inequality measurement fit  Recall the 
Pigou-Dalton Transfers Principle  A transfer of resources from a relatively poor to a relatively 
rich individual must raise income inequality 
This principle forms the building block for all measures of inequality  But now look at this 
example  Start here 
Polarization and Conflict  
Income or Wealth 
Density 
and go here  Income or Wealth 
Density 
By all measures of inequality that are consistent with the Lorenz criterion  or equivalently 
second-order stochastic domination  inequality has come down  Yet there is something 
disturbing about that  social tensions could be going up as two well-defined and distinct 
groups begin to form  There could be situations here in which polarization is going up 
Of course  this isn t to suggest that polarization   whatever it is   is always different from 
inequality  If there is a  global compression  of the distribution  we would expect both 
inequality and polarization to fall  See these diagrams  Start here 
  Polarization and Conflict 
Income or Wealth 
Density 
and go here  Income or Wealth 
Density 
But these two examples also tell us something else  It tells us that polarization may not be a 
 local construct  In both the examples  we have a compression taking place  yet they have 
very different implications  A  local move  may have different effects depending on the 
overall distribution  In contrast  inequality   as captured by the Pigou-Dalton principle  
is a local construct 
Observe  too  that the notion of  groups  may be quite general 
Economic  income- or wealth-based  class 
Social  religious  linguistic  geographical  political groupings 
Polarization and Conflict  
But a natural notion of  distance  across economic groups makes income-based polarization 
an easier starting point 
  A Measure of Polarization 
The task of this section is to develop axiomatically a measure of polarization  Our  inputs 
are various distributions of income or wealth on different populations  more precisely  density 
functions with varying populations 
Our  output  is a measure of polarization for each distribution 
As we ve tried to motivate earlier  each individual feels two things 
Identification with people of  similar  income 
 Use as proxy the height of density f x  at income x 
Alienation from people with  dissimilar  income 
 Income distance  y   x  of y from x 
We therefore describe the effective antagonism of x towards y as a function T i  a  where i is 
the identification that a person at income x feels  and a is the income distance between x 
and y  We suppose that T  a    T i        both a sense of identification and alienation is 
needed to fuel an effective sense of antagonism 
We view polarization as the  sum  of all such antagonisms over the population 
P f   
Z Z T 
 
f x   x   y 
 
f x f y dxdy 
This is not very useful as it stands  Way too much depends on the choice of the function T 
But hopefully it is a good starting point 
The axioms we use are based on densities that are unions of one or more basic densities  These 
are symmetric  unimodal density functions f with compact support 
 By symmetry we mean that f m   x    f m   x  for all x       and by unimodality we 
mean that f is nondecreasing on   m 
A basic density  or indeed any density 
can be population-scaled  g y    p f y 
can be income-scaled  g y     f x 
can undergo a slide to the right or left  g y    f y   x  and 
can be squeezed 
  Polarization and Conflict 
Take a closer look at this last one  Let f be any density and let   lie in     A  -squeeze of f 
is a transformation f 
 
 
  f 
 
 x   
 
 
f 
 
x        m 
 
 
 
Scalings  slides and squeezes partition the space of all densities  Each element of the partition 
can be associated with a root  a basic density on     with mean  
Axiom   If a distribution is just a single basic density  a  global compression  of that density 
cannot increase polarization 
That is  global compression  the move described in the diagram below  cannot raise 
polarization 
Income or Wealth 
Axiom   If a symmetric distribution is composed of three disjoint scalings of the same basic 
density  then a compression of the side densities cannot reduce polarization 
This is illustrated in the diagram below 
Income 
Density 
Axiom   Consider a symmetric distribution composed of four basic densities drawn from 
the same root  Slide the two middle densities to the side as shown  Then polarization must 
go up 
Polarization and Conflict  
This is illustrated in the diagram below 
Income 
Density 
Our last axiom states that polarization rankings must be invariant to population scalings 
Axiom    Population Neutrality  Polarization comparisons are unchanged if both 
populations are scaled up or down by the same percentage 
We can now state 
Theorem   A polarization measure satisfies Axioms   if and only if it is proportional to 
  Z Z f x 
 
f y y   x dydx 
where   lies between   and  
  Proof of Theorem  
Note  this section is technical  though illustrative  and should probably be omitted unless 
you are comfortable with long and detailed arguments 
First  we show that axioms   imply   The lemma below follows from Jensen s 
inequality  proof omitted

with         x 
  g x   
 
 
Z x

g y dy 
Then g must be a concave function 
In what follows  remember that our measure only considers income differences across people 
so that we may slide any distribution to left or right as we please 
Lemma   The function T must be concave in a for every i    
Proof  Fix x     some i     and       x  Consider three basic densities as in Axiom   but 
specialize as shown in Figure   each is a transform of a uniform basic density  The bases

are centered at  x    and x  The side densities are of width   and height h  and the middle 
density is of width   and height i  We shall vary   and h but to make sure that Axiom  
applies  we choose       such that     x  A  -squeeze of the side densities simply contracts 
their base width to   while the height is raised to h  For each   decompose the measure 
  into five components   a  The  internal polarization  Pm of the middle rectangle  This 
component doesn t vary with   so there will be no need to explicitly calculate it   b  The 
 internal polarization  Ps of each side rectangle   c  Total effective antagonism  Ams felt by 
inhabitants of the middle towards each side density   d  Total effective antagonism Asm felt 
by inhabitants of each side towards the middle   e  Total effective antagonism Ass felt by 
inhabitants of one side towards the other side  Each of these last four terms appear twice 
so that  writing everything as a function of

conclude that

As   must hold for every x     and every       x  we may invoke Lemma   to conclude 
that T is concave in x for every i    
Q E D 
Lemma   Let g be a concave  continuous function on IR  with g      Suppose that for each a

The proof is straightforward and is omitted 
Lemma   There is a continuous function  i  such that T i  a     i a for all i and a 
Proof  Fix a and a

to ensure disjoint support we assume throughout that     x and         y   x     for some 
      Again  decompose the polarization measure   into several distinct components

there is a function  i  such that T i  a     i a for every i and a  Given that T is continuous 
by assumption  the same must be true of

Lemma    i  must be of the form Ki 
  for constants  K       
Proof  As a preliminary step  observe that 
   i      whenever i    
otherwise Axiom   would fail for configurations constructed from rectangular basic densities 
of equal height i  We first prove that   satisfies the fundamental Cauchy equation

for every  p  p 
 
      To this end  fix p and p 
  and define r   pp

that p   r 
  Consider a configuration with two basic densities  both of width   the first 
centered at   and the second centered at   The heights are p and h  where h     but soon to

If r   p  simply permute p and r in the argument below

Notice that as       h  lies in some bounded set  We may therefore extract a convergent 
subsequence with limit h 
  as       By the continuity of   we may pass to the limit in  
and   to conclude that

  Polarization and Conflict 
Lemma   Given that P f  is of the form   Axiom   is satisfied if and only if      
Proof  Consider a configuration as given in Axiom   a symmetric distribution made out of 
three basic densities  By symmetry  the side densities must share the same root  call this f 
 
 
Let p denote their  common  population mass and m their  common  difference from their 
means to their lower support  Likewise  denote the root of the middle density by g 
 
  by q its 
population mass  and by n the difference between mean and lower support  As in the proof 
of Lemma   we may decompose the polarization measure   into several components 
First  there are the  internal polarizations  of the middle density  Pm  and of the two side 
densities  Ps  Next  there are various subtotals of effective antagonism felt by members 
of one of the basic densities towards another basic density  Let Ams denote this when the 
 origin  density is the middle and the  destination  density one of the sides  Likewise  Asm 
is obtained by permuting origin and destination densities  Finally  denote by Ass the total 
effective antagonism felt by inhabitants of one side towards the other side  Observe that 
each of these last four terms appear twice  so that  writing everything as a function of  
overall polarization is given by 
  P    Pm    Ps     Ams     Asm     Ass 
Compute these terms  For brevity  define for any root h

by construction  see   in the statement of Lemma   It follows from this expression that 
for Axiom   to hold  it is necessary and sufficient that for every three-density configuration

d 
m 
 f 
 
   
 
 
q 
p 
   
 
must be nonincreasing in   over     An examination of the expression in   quickly 
shows that a situation in which q is arbitrarily close to zero  relative to p  is a necessary 
and sufficient test case  By the same logic  one should make d m as small as possible  The 
disjoint-support hypothesis of Axiom   tells us that this lowest value is   So it will be 
necessary and sufficient to show that for every root f 
 
 
   
     f 
 
   
 
is nonincreasing in   over     For any f 
 
  it is easy enough to compute the necessary and 
sufficient bounds on   Simple differentiation reveals that 
     
     f 
 
   
 
must be nonnegative for every         the necessary and sufficient condition for this is 
     
 
     f 
 
   
 
Therefore  to find the necessary and sufficient bound on    uniform over all roots  we need 
to minimize  f 
 
    by choice of f 
 
  subject to the condition that f 
  be a root  By Lemma  
  this minimum value is   Using this information in   we are done 
Lemma   Given that P f  is of the form   Axiom   is satisfied 
Proof  Consider a symmetric distribution composed of four basic densities  as in the 
statement of Axiom   Number the densities       and   in the same order displayed 
in Figure   Let x denote the amount of the slide  experienced by the inner densities  in the 
axiom  For each such x  let djk x  denote the  absolute  difference between the means of basic 
densities j and k  As we have done several times before  we may decompose the polarization 
of this configuration into several components  First  there is the  internal polarization  of 
each rectangle j  call it Pj 
  j            These will stay unchanged with x  Next  there 
is the total effective antagonism felt by inhabitants of each basic density towards another 
call this Ajk x  where j is the  origin  density and k is the  destination  density  Thus total 
polarization P x  again written explicitly as a function of x  is given by 
P x

so that  using symmetry

Now Lemma   tells us that for all i and j

where kij is a positive constant which is independent of distances across the two basic 
densities  and in particular is independent of x  Using this information in   it is trivial 
to see that

so that Axiom   is satisfied 
Given   Axiom   is trivial to verify  Therefore Lemmas     and   complete the

  Polarization and Inequality 
Our measurement of polarization is given by 
Pol  
Z Z f x 
 
f y y   x dydx 
where   lies between   and  
Compare with the Gini coefficient   fractionalization index 
Gini  
Z Z f x f y y   x dydx 
It s the value of   that makes all the difference  The lower bound on   comes from Axiom  
which directly runs against inequality  Otherwise the other axioms are broadly in agreement 
in inequality 
Note by the way that there also must be an upper bound on   For if this were not the case 
identification effects will swamp alienation effects and global squeezes in the distribution 
will increase polarization  which makes no sense  This is the job of Axiom  
  Three New Properties 
  Bimodality  Polarization maximal for bimodal distributions  but defined of course over all 
distributions 
  Globality  The local merging of two  groups  raises polarization if there is a third  group 
of significant size  but lowers conflict in the absence of such a group 
  Nonlinearity  Same direction of population or income movements may cause polarization 
to go down or up  depending on context

  Other Remarks on the Measure 
  More on   As we ve discussed  there is a family of possible values of   subject to the 
lower and upper bounds of   and   We ve already explained where these bounds come 
from  The bounds can be narrowed further using additional axioms  though it is unclear 
how compelling the additional steps are  Here is an example of the axiomatic approach 
Axiom   If p   q but p   q is small and so is r  a small shift of mass from r to q cannot reduce 
polarization 
Diagrammatically  go from here 
Income 
Density

to here 
Income 
Density 
Theorem   Under the additional Axiom   it must be that       so the unique polarization 
measure that satisfies the five axioms is proportional to 
Z Z f x 
 
f y y   x dydx 
In a later section  we argue that there are strong behavioral reasons to focus on      
Polarization and Conflict  
  Scaling  Note that our main theorem states that polarization must be proportional to 
a particular family of measures  There is therefore a scale factor here which can be employed 
as we please  While this is not entirely precise  we can exploit this degree of freedom to 
make the measure scale-free  Normalize the measure by  
 
  where   is mean income 
This procedure is equivalent to one in which all incomes are normalized by their mean 
Esteban and Ray   begin  in contrast  by using the log of incomes and imposing axioms 
on this variable 
  Importance of the IA Structure  Both the axioms and the IA structure needed to 
pin down P 
It can be checked that several other candidates satisfy Axioms   These details are to be 
included in future editions of the notes 
  Partial Ordering    varies between bounds  but can vary  So theorem gives us a 
partial ordering  Ordinal description of this ordering is an open question 
  Identification Windows   Identification  here is based on the point density  More 
generally  individuals may possess a  window of identification  Individuals within this 
window would be considered  similar    possibly with weights decreasing with the 
distance   and would contribute to a sense of group identity 
At the same time  individuals would feel alienated only from those outside the window 
Thus  broadening one s window of identification has two effects 
Can capture these two effects somewhat in our seemingly narrower model 
Suppose that each individual at x  perceives  an individual with income y to be at the point 
    t x   ty  Thus the parameter t is inversely proportional to  breadth of identification 
The  perceived density  of y from the vantage point of an individual located at x is then 
 
t 
f 
 
y       t x 
t 
 
It is easy to see that the polarization measure resulting from this extended notion of 
identification is proportional to our measure by the factor t 
 
 
It is also possible to directly base identification on the average density over a non-degenerate 
window of width w  When we take w to zero  not only is P attained in the limit  but P is a 
first-order approximation to P 
w  in the sense that  P 
w w w     
Nevertheless  the question of identification windows deserves more attention 
  Comparing Distributions  Our characterization shows that a comparison across 
distributions should depend on average alienation  average identification and on their joint 
co-movement  We formalize this very quickly 
  Polarization and Conflict 
Let a y   
R 
 y   x dF x  which is the alienation felt by y  and define average alienation a  by 
a   
Z 
a y dF y   
Z Z  y   x dF x dF y 
Similarly  f y 
 
is the identification felt by y  so define the average  -identification   by 
   
Z 
f y 
 
dF y   
Z 
f y 
 
dy 
Finally  let   be the normalized covariance between identification and alienation 
    cov a a 
Then it is easy to verify that 
P f    a 
 
     
 
 
  Social Polarization 
Our polarization measure is easily applicable to ethnolinguistic or religious groupings 
Suppose that there are M  social groups  based on region  kin  ethnicity  religion  Let 
nj be the number of individuals in group j  with overall population normalized to one 
Let Fj describe the distribution of income in group j  with fj 
the accompanying density 
unnormalized by group population  One may now entertain a variety of  social polarization 
measures 
  Pure Social Polarization  Consider  first  the case of  pure social polarization  in 
which income plays no role  Assume that each person is  fully  identified with every other 
member of his group  Likewise  the alienation function takes on values that are specific to 
group pairs and have no reference to income  For each pair of groups j and k denote this 
value by  jk  Then a natural transplant of   yields the measure

Even this sort of specification may be too general in some interesting instances in which 
individuals are interested only in the dichotomous perception Us They  In particular  in these 
instances  individuals are not interested in differentiating between the different opposing 
groups  Perhaps the simplest instance of this is a pure contest  Esteban and Ray

a paper that we discuss in more detail below  It is instructive to recall the ELF  which is

and compare the two 
For instance  if all groups are of equal size  then polarization peaks when the number of 
groups equals   and steadily declines thereafter  Fractionalization rises throughout 
As Montalvo and Reynal-Querol show  it matters empirically too      
Guatemala and Sierra Leone are examples of countries in which ethnic polarization is high 
but ethnic fractionalization is low  Nigeria and Bosnia are examples of countries in which 
religious polarization is high but religious fractionalization is low 
Once the two extremes   pure income polarization and pure social polarization   are 
identified  we may easily consider several hybrids  As examples  consider the case in 
which notions of identification are mediated not just by group membership but by income 
similarities as well  while the antagonism equation remains untouched  Then we get what 
  Polarization and Conflict 
one might call social polarization with income-mediated identification 
  Ps F

One could expand  or contract  the importance of income further  while still staying away 
from the extremes  For instance  suppose that   in addition to the income-mediation of 
group identity   alienation is also income-mediated  for alienation  two individuals must 
belong to different groups and have different incomes  Now groups have only a demarcating 
role   they are necessary  but not sufficient  for identity  and they are necessary  but not 
sufficient  for alienation  The resulting measure would look like this

Note that we do not intend to suggest that other special cases or hybrids are not possible  or 
that they are less important  The discussion here is only to show that social and economic 
considerations can be profitably combined in the measurement of polarization  Indeed 
it is conceivable that such measures will perform better than the more commonly used 
fragmentation measures in the analysis of social conflict  But a full exploration of this last 
theme must await future research  though see the chapter on ethnic conflict below 
  Empirics Revisited  Polarization  not Fragmentation 
We now discuss the recent results of Montalvo and Reynal-Querol   They employ the 
same basic specification as Fearon-Laitin   and others  but this time with polarization 
instead of fractionalization indices 
They study   countries over   The dependent variable is incidence of a civil 
war over a five year period  They use what is known as the PRIO  criterion for civil war 
at least   yearly deaths   Refine this in later versions  Their explanatory variables include 
per-capita income  population size  terrain  proxy for ease of insurgency  primary exports 
 proxy for payoff in event of victory  democracy indicators  and of course indices of ethnic 
or religious polarization 
First run a logit of civil war on ethnic fractionalization  Table   reports on the results 
Observe how fractionalization matters in the first column but loses significance completely 
as variables such as per-capita income are included  This is the standard result that we had 
described earlier 
Now for the logit using ethnic polarization  Table   reports  Ethnic polarization is not just 
significant through all the variants  the effect is pretty big too  For instance  if polarization is 
raised from    the average  to    Nigeria  the predicted probability of conflict doubles 
 An increase by one standard deviation   raises conflict probability by  
Now try the same logit with religious variables instead  Table   shows that just like 
ethnic fractionalization  religious fractionalization starts out significant but matters quickly 
degenerate when additional controls are thrown in  This finding is to be contrasted with

what happens when a religious polarization variable is employed  Table   Religious 
polarization stays significant through the various specifications  just as ethnic polarization 
did 
These observations are robust to several different specifications  Ethnic polarization is 
significant when entered into same regression with ethnic fractionalization  the latter is not 
The same is true if a measure of ethnic dominance  Collier   and Collier and Hoeffler 
  is used instead  Both these observations are still true if  ethnic  is replaced by 
 religious 
The analysis is also robust to the use of different datasets  The World Christian Encyclopedia 
is used here to construct ethnic polarization indices  Alternatively  the Encyclopedia 
Britannica or the Atlas Nadorov Mira could be used  My main worry here is that I am not 
sure how the authors have constructed their ethnic groupings  Clearly they ahev aggregated 
some of the highly disaggregated information  But what if they ve done so in some way

The results are also robust to  joint indices  of ethnic and religious polarization Measure

  Next Steps 
Let s return to the old question  is ethnicity primordial or instrumental as a determinant of 
conflict 
An economist s instincts suggests that these things are essentiall y instrumental but I suppose 
one never knows      
Recall that the findings on per-capita income certainly support an instrumentalist position 
on civil war  That suggests a test for ethnic instrumentality  see if economic differences 
across groups predicts conflict  But there is an important and fundamental reason why such 
a test may be problematic 
Two kinds of economic conflict   vertical  versus  horizontal 
The  vertical war  certainly exists but is harder to spot and infrequently delineated by 
ethnicity  Caste is a good counterexample  With ethnicity and religion  the conflict is 
often horizontal  attacks on competing businesses  reduction of labor supply  reallocation of 
specific public goods  Listen to Horowitz again 
 In study after study  it has been assumed that ethnic relations are necessary 
relations between superiors and subordinates       In fact  many ethnic 
groups are enmeshed in a system of subordination  But the relations of

many other ethnic groups   on a global scale  most ethnic groups   are 
not accurately defined as superior-subordinate relations      
Unlike ranked groups  which form part of a single society  unranked 
groups constitute incipient whole societies  It is not so much the politics of 
subordination that concerns them  but rather the politics of inclusion and 
exclusion 
How then to augment our polarization measure for wealth differences across and within 
groups  The answer may depend on the observer s feel for the sort of conflict that is relevant 
If conflict is  vertical  income differences across groups are conducive to conflict  and so is 
income homogeneity within groups 
On the other hand  if conflict is  horizontal  income or occupational similarities across 
groups may drive conflict and so might income inequality within groups  the buying of 
 conflict labor  as with Dalits in the Gujarat carnage  I will come back to these matters 
later 
The interaction of economics and ethnicity creates new conceptual challenges for the 
measurement of polarization

  Summary So Far 
  Several authors  notably Samuel Huntington  have argued for cultural explanations of 
economic development  or lack thereof 
  Extending this line of thinking  authors such as Donald Horowitz have suggested links 
between conflict and ethnic differences 
  But statistical studies that employ a well-known measure of ethnic and religious 
fragmentation show no links with conflict   Though there are links with economic growth 
  In this chapter  I argue for the use of a measure very different from fragmentation   a 
polarization index 
  The measure has a philosophical foundation   the identity-alienation framework   which 
may turn out to be useful in other applications 
  I then discuss an empirical study which uses this polarization measure to exhibit a robust 
and positive relationship between  ethnic or religious  polarization and the incidence of 
conflict 
  This does not mean that we buy Huntington on the primordial nature of cultural 
differences  An economic war may still be waged behind the ethnic veil 
Polarization and Conflict  
  A Behavioral Approach to Polarization 
No measurement theory can do justice to the claim that there is indeed a link between 
polarization and conflict 
Two potential links 
  Empirical  fit the measures to the data and see they are related to measured indicators 
of social conflict 
  Theoretical  write down a  natural  theory of conflict in which the level of 
equilibrium conflict is related to distributional polarization 
Here  we concentrate on the latter  with an eye on the former  of course

Then R  squared  is the unique real eigenvalue of this matrix 
 The associated share vector is the unique positive eigenvector  on the simplex  corresponding 
to this eigenvalue 
Remark  Observe the squaring of the population coefficients  This is related to polarization 
in a way that we will explain later 
  Connections with Polarization 
Several connections between behavioral model and the axiomatic approach 
  Bimodality  Both conflict and measured polarization are maximal for symmetric bimodal 
distributions 
  Polarization and Conflict 
  Globality  The local clustering of two groups raises conflict if there is a third group of 
significant size  but lowers conflict in the absence of a third group  Same true of polarization 
  Nonmonotonicity  Start with a uniform distribution of population across G groups  where 
G     Transfer population mass from one of the groups to the others  until a uniform 
distribution over G     groups is obtained  Then conflict   and polarization   are higher 
at the  end  of this process  but may go down in the  intermediate  stages

  Four Research Questions 
A  Group Formation and Interaction 
In many situations  groups are effectively given   men and women  Hindus and Muslims 
importers and exporters  
In others  there is a wider dispersion of preferences and  sharp  groups arise as a result of 
explicit membership decisions   political parties  trade unions  environmental coalitions 
Polarization and Conflict  
Can be modeled as a two-stage game  For theory  see Bloch     Ray and Vohra 
      Konishi and Ray   Yi    
  In  stage   individuals  possibly endowed with widely varying characteristics  form 
groups   They take  similar  actions  form coalitions or clubs  write binding agreements 
  In  stage   groups  interact  in the way described earlier 
For some recent attempts for  conflict games  see Bloch and Sanchez   Esteban and 
Sakovicz   Tan and Wang    
B  Group Salience 
Return to the case of given groups  Many intersecting dimensions  what determines which 
group classification is salient 
To some extent  the answer must depend on the set of available policies 
One might say that a society is polarized if the average resistance over a set of policies is high 
Can apply this notion quite easily once we fix a space of policies and a measure over that 
space 
E g  look at a very simple policy x  for which the winners are to one side of the income level 
x and the losers are on the other 
x 
Winners Losers 
Resistance to policy     - F x 
If we equate polarization to average resistance over a distribution G of policies  we get 
P  
R 
min F x      F x dG x 
Might argue that G is uniform or even equal to F  Still begs the question  what determines 
the space of policies 
C  Effort and Money 
Behavioral model looks pleasantly general  but in fact the explicit introduction of income 
 or wealth  poses new challenges 
  Polarization and Conflict 
How are resources expended in the lobbying process 
 In a  perfect  democracy where all questions are solved by referenda  this problem becomes 
irrelevant 
The poor use effort  the rich use money 
The political system determines a political exchange rate between effort and money 
Individual characteristics  abilities  access  wealth  determine an economic exchange rate 
between effort and money 
The cutoff for different types of participation  effort vs  money  will depend on the political 
system 
The structural features of such a model will impose useful restrictions on empirical analysis 
Typically  instances of open conflict will be observable while the use of money to influence 
policies will not be 
Suggests the use of modified polarization measures in which the symmetry between different 
groups is broken if there are wealth differences 
D  Lobbies as Signals 
Based on Esteban and Ray  
  Governments play a role in the allocation of resources 
  Governments lack information   just as private agents do   regarding which sectors 
are worth pushing in the interests of economic efficiency 
  Agents  sectoral interests  industrial confederations  R D coalitions   lobby the 
government for preferential treatment 
  A government   even if it honestly seeks to maximize economic efficiency   may be 
confounded by the possibility that both high wealth and true economic desirability create 
loud lobbies 
Connects inequality and lobbying to resource allocation 
  Summary 
I have discussed two approaches to study of polarization and conflict 
The axiomatic approach delivers a new set of measures which may be useful in empirical 
work 
Polarization and Conflict  
The behavioral approach complements the axiomatic approach by explicitly laying down a 
model of conflict 
While the axiomatic approach is possibly of greater empirical relevance  the behavioral 
approach cannot be dispensed with as a conceptual check on the axioms 
In particular  issues of group formation  group salience  the use of alternative forms of 
resources in a conflictual process  and role of lobbying as a signaling device can be usefully 
analyzed under the behavioral approach 
  Other Issues in the Theory of Conflict 
  Public Versus Private Goods  So far we have assumed that conflict takes place 
over the allocation of public goods  One might also be interested in situations in which the 
good to be allocated is private or partly private  For simplicity  suppose that there are only 
two groups  with population sizes n  and n  summing to one  We also suppose that the cost 
function is isoelastic  c r     r 
 
for        thus satisfying our third-derivative condition 
There is a budget of G which is up for grabs  Assume that a fraction   of this is public  while 
the remaining fraction is private and divided equally among the winning group  Group i 
then chooses ri 
to maximize 
niri 
R 
 
 G        
G 
ni 
 
  c r 
Define P n

 G

  then the FOC for this problem is 
P ni

or 
  P ni ninj   R 
 
r 
 
i 
rj 
 
Similarly 
  P nj ninj   R 
 
r 
 
j 
ri 
 
Raising both sides of   to the power       and multiplying with   we see that 
  P ni ninj P nj ninj 
    R 
 
r 
 
j 
 
If       we see right away that 
  R 
    P ni n 
 
i 
P nj n 
 
j 
 
and it is very easy to now see that this expression is maximized at the symmetric bipolar 
distribution in which ni   nj     Thus in the quadratic case the degree to which the 
prize is public or private matters not at all in determining which distribution is the most 
conflictual 
  Polarization and Conflict 
When       an extended version of   holds  which we now derive  Use equation  
and the assumption that       to write 
  rj  
h 
P ni P nj 
 
i 
 ninj 
 R 
 
 
Of course  a parallel equation holds for ri 
 
  ri  
h 
P ni 
 P nj 
i 
 ninj 
 R 
 
 
Multiplying both sides of   by nj and both sides of   by ni 
  and adding the two 
equations  we see that 
R   R 
  h 
P ni P nj 
i 
 ninj 
  n 
P ni 
 nj   P nj 
 ni 
o 
 
and after manipulating  quite  a bit  we conclude that 
R 
   
h 
P ni P nj 
i

n 
P ni 
 nj   P nj 
 ni 
o 
 
h 
P ni niP nj nj

P nj 
 nj   P ni 
 ni 
o 
 
and this is the appropriate extension of   which was derived for        in fact  just put 
      in   to recover  
It can be shown that for       this function is maximized at ni   nj     Details relegated 
to Digression below 
Digression  Do you really want to read this  Well  carry on if you must  We are going to show that 
the last line in   is maxed at ni   nj     There are three terms in this last line  each raised to 
different powers  It is very easy to verify that the first and second of these  P ni niP nj nj and ninj 
 
are each maximized when ni   nj     The third term  which is raised to the power       takes a 
bit more work  It will suffice to show that the expression 
P n 
 n  
h 
 Gn         Gn 
i 
is concave in n  It is actually trivial to verify this either for       or       but the intermediate 
steps require some calculus  Differentiate the expression above with respect to n to obtain the first 
derivative proportional to

I don t believe this result holds when      
Polarization and Conflict  
To complete the argument we must show that the very last line above is negatively related to n  To 
do this it suffices to show that the derivative of 
 
   
         
 
x 
 
         x 
 
with respect to x is nonnegative  That derivative is given by 
         x 
           
 
 
 
   
         
 
x

We ve therefore shown that the bipolarization result is quite robust when it comes to 
explaining the intensity of conflict  conditional on it happening in the first place  Whether 
the good to be fought over is public or private really does not matter too much 
  Conflict Initiation  The italicized phrase in the last paragraph is important  however 
Highly polarized situations may not exhibit any conflict to begin with  because 
everyone knows that the conflict is going to be very costly if it happens  Therefore  a little 
bit more attention has to be paid to theories that attempt to relate conflict to polarization 
Let us explore these matters a bit further as they have interesting implications for the identity 
of the initiating party  Suppose again that there are two groups  and that group i receives 
a peacetime payoff in which it obtains a share si of the good  Then it is easy to see that its 
peacetime payoff is simply given by siP ni  where we define P n   
h 
 G        
G 
n 
i 
as in 
the previous section  It follows that group i will want to engage in conflict provided that 
  P ni 
niri 
R 
  c ri    siP ni 
where ri and R are to be interpreted as equilibrium values in the ensuing conflict 
Once again adopt the isoelastic specification and recall the first-order condition   with 
respect to ri 
  But write it in a form that we used for our conflict and distribution study 
  P ni pipj   r 
 
i 
 
where pi  and likewise pj  is just the win probability or conflict share niri R  We may use 
this to obtain a quasi-closed-form for the net payoff from conflict 
  P n pi   c ri    P ni 
 
pi  
 
 
pi    pi 
 
 
Now we proceed to an analysis of conflict initiation  Consider the equivalent formulation 
of the first-order condition for group i  which essentially reproduces  
  P ni ninj   R 
 
r 
 
i 
rj 
 
  Polarization and Conflict 
If the good in question is purely public  then we may simply normalize P n      so that 
ninj   R 
 
r 
 
i 
rj 
 
Of course  exactly the same condition applies to rj 
  and it therefore follows that ri   rj   R 
and so pi   ni 
  Using this information in   above and invoking   we obtain the 
following condition for conflict initiation 
ni  
 
 
ni    ni    si 
 
It is easy to see that the left-hand side of this expression is strictly increasing in ni 
 
 
  and that 
it must therefore cross the right-hand side from below  provided si 
lies strictly between  
and   We conclude then that large groups initiate conflict when the battle is over public 
goods 
Place si at   for symmetry  Observe that the condition never holds when ni     This 
is the most polarized case but it does not exhibit conflict  On the other hand  once conflict 
breaks out it is monotonically related to polarization  as discussed in the previous section 
So equilibrium conflict jumps up at the threshold and then declines again monotonically to 
zero as ni    
An interesting point to note is that ni  
 
s is always sufficient for conflict  simply make 
the LHS as small as possible in   by putting       This is a more general point that 
is independent of the cost function 
In any case the important point is that large groups 
initiate in the public goods case 
This observation is  however  reversed when the good at stake is private  To see this  recall 
the first-order condition for group i    and normalize P n     n to see that 
nj   R 
 
r 
 
i 
rj 
 
Dividing by the corresponding first-order condition for group j  we may conclude that 
ri 
rj 
 
 nj 
ni 
 
 
which captures part of the Olson intuition that small groups lobby more per-capita 
Therefore the probability that i wins the conflict is given by 
  pi  
niri 
niri   njrj 
 
n 
 
i 
n 
 
i 
  n 
 
j 
 
 The reason is that the derivative of n    n  never exceeds  
 To prove this  note that the more general first-order condition is just ninj   R 
 
c 
 
 ri rj for both i and j  so it is 
still true that ri   rj   R  It follows that c 
 
 R R   ninj 
  Now recall the conflict initiation condition   and note 
that by convexity c 
 
 R R   c R  Therefore a sufficient condition for   to hold is that ni   ninj   si 
  which 
proves the claim 
 This is  however  far from a full examination of the Olson paradox as we also have to allow for free-riding 
within the group  For a model that does this  see Esteban and Ray  APSR  
Polarization and Conflict  
so in particular large groups still have a higher win probability 
Finally  invoke   and   to write down the condition for conflict initiation in the 
private goods case  which is 
 
pi  
 
 
pi    pi 
 
  si 
 
where pi 
is now given by  
In contrast to si     the symmetric case for peacetime is now si   ni 
  Let us use this 
benchmark to understand conflict initiation  Rewriting the condition above with si   ni 
  we 
obtain 
   
 
p 
 
i 
 
     
 
pi   ni 
 
Combine this inequality and   to now establish the following observation  There is a 
unique population threshold below which a group will initiate conflict 
To prove this claim  recall   and take a closer look at p  dropping subscripts 
p n   
n 
k 
n 
k       n 
k 
 
where k         The function p has an interesting  reverse-logistic  shape  It starts 
above the  
line and at the point n     crosses it and dips below  The derivatives at the 
two ends are infinite  To check these claims  note that 
n 
k 
n 
k       n 
k 
  n 
if and only if n      simply cross-multiply and verify this  and that 
p 
 
 n   
knk 
    n 
k 
 n 
k       n 
k 
 
 
 
which is infinite both at n     and n     Now recall   and write it as 
    k p n 
    kp n    n 
By the arguments just made on derivatives  the LHS starts out higher than the RHS and ends 
up lower than the RHS  This means that conflict is preferable for small minorities and not so 
for large majorities  in contrast already to the results for public goods 
Indeed  we can strengthen that last argument to show that 
    k p n 
    kp n    n 
for any n     that conflict becomes strictly bad for any weak  nonunanimous  majority 
Suppose this is false for some     n     By the properties of p already established  we 
know that n     implies n   p n  so that 
    k n 
    kn   n 
but this can never happen when n     a contradiction  So conflict can never be preferable 
for a weak majority of the population 
  Polarization and Conflict 
It remains finally to show that there is a unique intersection  crossing from above to below 
in the interior  Let n 
        be an interior solution  then 
    k p n 
 
 
    kp n 
 
    n 
 
 
Differentiate to show that the crossing is  from above 
CHAPTER  
Inequality and Incentives 
In this chapter we study collective action problems  such as team production or the voluntary 
provision of public goods  and identify three channels through which inequality affects 
incentives and therefore overall efficiency 
The general structure of a team production problem is as follows  There is a group of n 
agents  each of whom contributes resources  money  effort  ri 
  The joint output is given by 
  Y   F r 
where r    r         rn  is a  nonnegative  vector 
Depending on the application  Y could be a public good or a private good 
I now introduce the three channels through which inequality might function 
A  Wealth  Suppose that the team good is public  and that person i has wealth endowment 
wi 
  The person i s payoff may be written as 
Y   u yi   ri 
The question then is  how does inequality in wealth affect incentives 
B  Access  Suppose that all agents are identical in endowment  and the good is private  But 
it is unequally distributed  Then different individuals have different shares of Y 
In this example  our proxy for inequality is a vector of shares          n  which sum to 
unity  For instance  this may be a problem of joint maintenance of an irrigation network  or 
of cooperative farming  in which case the shares would proxy the amount of land holdings 
of the agent 
How might inequality in access affect incentives 
C  Inequality Tolerance  Attitudes to inequality might affect incentives in situations where 
commitment is not possible  To illustrate this problem suppose that there are two regions 
A and B which receive funding from an equality-minded central government  Suppose that 
region i invests ri and produces yi   f ri   think of yi as regional tax revenues and ri as 
resources put into the generation of local revenues 
  Inequality and Incentives 
Suppose that the center must choose transfers ti 
to each of the regions  satisfying some 
budget constraint tA   tB   T  Suppose that it has welfare function 
W yA   tA    W yB   tB 
If the center can commit to the transfers then in a symmetric optimum it would set ti   T 
and then each region i would choose ri 
to 
max ti   f ri    ri 
 
this would implement the first-best without a problem  However  if the center does not 
commit to the transfers then the states move first and choose yi 
  This creates a dilemma if 
the center then picks tA and tB to 
max W yA   tA    W yB   tB 
with yA and yB given  Ignoring corner solutions  we see that this would entail 
yA   tA   yB   tB 
This creates a disincentive problem for the regions  Each region i will anticipate this 
compensatory behavior by the center and so choose ti 
to maximize 
yi   ri yA  yB 
It is easy to see that this leads to the first-order condition 
 
 
f 
 
 ri     
which implies substantial underinvestment relative to the first best 
Clearly  much of this depends on how the center reacts to the choices of yA and yB  which in 
turn depends on the degree of egalitarianism felt by the center  which is embodied in W  It 
also depends on whether the center plans to  compensate  the regions for their investment 
of r  This leads to the general class of questions 
When a principal cannot commit to a reward function  how does her tolerance for inter-agent 
inequality affect the incentives of participating agents 
  Inequality in Endowments 
I build on a classic paper on the voluntary provision of public goods by Bergstrom  Blume 
and Varian   There are n agents  each of whom contributes resources ri 
to a public 
good  Output is given by 
  G   f r 
where r  
P 
i 
ri 
  and f is smooth  increasing and concave   One can take a more general 
specification but this will do to illustrate our main points 
The individual utility function is 
u ci    G 
where ci   wi   ri for all i  and u is smooth  increasing and strictly concave 
Inequality and Incentives  
An equilibrium is a vector r 
 
such that every individual i choose r 
 
i 
optimally  given that 
resources contributed by the others is r 
 
j 
for j   i 
Proposition   There exists a unique equilibrium 
Proof  Suppose  on the contrary  that two distinct vectors r and r 
  are both equilibria 
Without loss of generality r 
    r  Pick i such that r 
 
i 
  ri 
  Because r 
 
i 
    we must have 
  u 
 
 wi   r 
 
i 
    f 
 
 r 
 
 
while 
  u 
 
 wi   ri    f 
 
 r 
Because r 
 
i 
  ri 
  we have that u 
 
 wi   r 
 
i 
    u 
 
 wi   ri  Using this in   and   we must 
conclude that 
f 
 
 r 
 
    u 
 
 wi   r 
 
i 
    u 
 
 wi   ri    f 
 
 r 
so that by the concavity of f  r 
    r  This is a contradiction 
Our next proposition describes an interesting fact about the Bergstrom-Blume-Varian model 
which is that   to the extent that contributions are interior   it is a distribution-neutral 
theory 
Proposition   Suppose that under a wealth distribution w every individual makes strictly positive 
contributions  Consider another wealth distribution w 
  with the same aggregate wealth  such that 
no individual s wealth is reduced by more than her contribution under w  Then r   r 
 
  overall 
contributions are unaffected 
Proof  Define  i   w 
 
i 
  wi for every i  and then define r 
 
i 
  ri    i 
  Because P 
i 
 i     we have 
r 
    r  Also  r 
 
i 
    for all i because ri    i 
  by assumption  Now recall that 
u 
 
 wi   ri    f 
 
 r 
for all i  because ri     so we must conclude that 
u 
 
 w 
 
i 
  r 
 
i 
    f 
 
 r 
 
 
as well  This means that r 
 
is an equilibrium under the new wealth distribution  and by 
Proposition   it is the only one 
Proposition   In any equilibrium  everyone who makes positive contributions has their 
consumptions and utilities fully equalized  regardless of their wealth 
Proof  For ri and rj both positive  we must have 
u 
 
 wi   ri    u 
 
 wj   rj    f 
 
 r 
so that ci   cj and ui   uj 
 
This is a strange result  and it cannot be broken even with very general utility functions such 
as u c  G  It does break down if f is asymmetric across agents or if the utility function is 
heterogeneous across agents 
  Inequality and Incentives 
This motivates a careful study of corner solutions in the voluntary contributions model 
These solutions are not at all exceptional  it is quite reasonable to suppose that some poor 
agents do not make contributions  while the richer agents do  So let w be some wealth 
distribution  Let I be the set of all agents who make positive contributions  I    i ri    
Observe that small redistributions of wealth within I have no effect on aggregate outcomes 
just as in the neutrality proposition studied earlier 
What about a redistribution from j   I to some i   I 
Proposition   Greater inequality in wealth either leaves aggregate contributions unchanged  or 
pushes them towards higher levels 
Proof  To prove this  it suffices to consider a small transfer   from j   I to i   I  such that 
the set I remains unchanged   This follows from Proposition   on distribution-neutrality

Therefore in the Bergstrom-Blume-Varian model  we must conclude that greater wealth 
inequality must lead to greater provision of the public good  Roughly speaking  wealth 
inequality raises the contribution costs of noncontributors and lowers the cost to contributors 
The former has no effect  noncontributors are noncontributors and it does not matter 
whether their costs go up or not  The latter increases contributions  hence the result 
It should be pointed out that the effect on total  utilitarian  surplus is uncertain  After 
all  utilities are concave and disequalizing them through regressive transfers of wealth has 
inherently negative consequences  However  sometimes one can argue that overall welfare 
goes up  A disequalization of wealth has three effects   i  it increases rich utilities  positive 
 b  it lowers poor utilities  negative  and  c  it increases public goods supply  positive  To 
compute net effects think of a two-person example in which   is a contributor and   is not 
If we are very close to the contribution threshold for   we have that 
w    r    w 
by the equalization proposition above  Now a disequalization of wealth will have no firstorder 
effect on the sum of utilities  while it will have a first-order positive effect on public 
good provision 
In the next section  we will see an important sense in which Proposition   may not be 
robust 
Inequality and Incentives  
  Inequality in Access 
In this section  we assume that the output is a private good  though with a little bit of clever 
renormalization most of the analysis goes through with mixed public-private goods 
The objective is to analyze access inequalities  so we will have the produced output divided in 
some given way among the contributing agents  The question is  how does the inequality 
in this division affect efficiency 
Our focus will be on an aspect of production that we did not consider in the last section  we 
will allow for the inputs of different agents to be complements in producing the joint output 
The maintenance of an irrigation network is a good generic example  the maintenance 
of different stretches of an irrigation channel is complementary  and the idea of access 
inequalities also makes sense  think of irrigation being important in proportion to the amount 
of land being farmed 
Other than complementarities  we keep everything very simple  Individual utility functions 
are identical  and taken to be linear both in consumption and in contributions  which  in 
keeping with the maintenance example  we will now call effort e  Thus each agent i seeks to 
maximize ci   ei 
  and chooses ei 
to 
  max 
ei 
 iF ei 
  e i    ei 
where the notation e i stands for the vector e with the ith component removed 
An equilibrium is an effort vector e 
  with the property that for every i  e 
 
i 
solves   given 
e 
 
 i 
 
An effort vector e  is efficient if it maximizes the expression 
S    F e   
Xn 
i 
ei 
over all possible effort vectors  Thus S  is the maximal surplus that can be generated in 
the economy  Assume that appropriate end-point conditions hold so that the maximization 
problem above is well-defined 
Define the surplus S 
  associated with any equilibrium e 
  by the expression F e 
 
   
Pn 
i 
e 
 
i 
 
Obviously  S 
    S  in any equilibrium  Take S    S 
 
to be our measure of the inefficiency of an 
equilibrium 
This definition naturally induces a class of inefficiency measures for a given level of  access 
inequality  as proxied by   We adopt the following definition  the inefficiency I  of access 
inequality   is given by 
  I    min S    S 
 
  S 
 
is the surplus associated with some equilibrium e 
  under  
The question that we seek to explore is  which levels of access inequality minimize 
inefficiency  Writers such as Mancur Olson have stressed that unequal sharing rules are 
good for efficiency  because they minimize the free-rider problem  We may summarize this 
intuition in the following 
  Inequality and Incentives 
Proposition   Suppose that F is an increasing  concave function of the sum of efforts  F e   
f 
Pn 
i 
ei  for some increasing differentiable concave f satisfying the Inada endpoint conditions  Let 
               n  and  
     
 
 
           
n 
  be two different access inequalities  with the property that 
maxi  i   maxi  
 
i 
  Then I    I 
 
  Moreover  I      as   converges to any of the unit vectors 
Proof  Let M    maxi  i 
  Then in any equilibrium e 
  under   e 
 
i 
is positive only if  i   M 
and consequently  if E 
   
Pn 
i 
e 
 
i 
  E 
  must maximize M f E E with respect to E  Thus I 
is simply S    M f E 
 
    E 
 
  It is easy to check that I  is monotonically decreasing in M 
and indeed  that I      along any sequence such that M     
Thus under some conditions  inequality of sharing is conducive to efficiency  These 
conditions require that output be a function of the sum of efforts  This assumption may 
be particularly cogent in the case of lobbying  where the effectiveness of lobbying may be a 
function of the sum of monetary contributions 
However  in many production activities  the efforts of different individuals may be 
complements in production  The following equally simple proposition considers the extreme 
Leontief case  to provide a stark contrast to Proposition  
Proposition   Suppose that F is an increasing concave function of the scale of activity  where 
scale is determined by equi-proportional contribution of efforts  F e    f mini ei  for some increasing 
differentiable concave f satisfying the Inada endpoint conditions  Let                n  and  
   
 
 
 
           
n 
  be two different access inequalities  with the property that mini  i   mini  
 
i 
  Then 
I    I 
 
 
Proof  Note that in this case we have a continuum of equilibria for each possible level of 
access inequality   These are characterized as follows 
Define m    mini  i 
  Then for each   e 
 
is an equilibrium vector of efforts if and only if 
e 
 
 
  e 
 
 
          e 
 
n   e  say  and m f 
 
 e      Thus 
I    S    m f e    ne 
It is easy to check that I  is a decreasing function of m 
Thus in this case  we have exactly the opposite result  equality is conducive to efficiency 
though unlike the case of proposition   we never obtain full efficiency  it is easy to check 
that I  is bounded away from zero  We may therefore conjecture that the least inefficient 
access inequality varies in some systematic way with the degree of complementarity in 
production 
  More on Access Inequalities  The analysis above suggests that the degree of 
substitution will play a role in determining whether or not inequality is good for efficiency 
To capture this idea  parameterize production so it runs the gamut from perfect to zero 
substitutability of effort is to use a CES structure for the vector of efforts  Thus we may take 
F to have the form 
Inequality and Incentives  
  F e   
 
 
Xn 
i 
e 
 
i 
 
 
 
 
 
where       measures the degree of effort substitution  and         is a scale parameter 
Direct computation reveals that the maximal surplus S  in this model is given by 
  S     
 
       n 
 
 
 
To compute the Nash equilibrium  note first that for       best responses for each i are 
strictly positive provided that all other efforts are strictly positive  So let us write down 
interior first-order conditions to the maximization problem   for each i  which we may 
rephrase here as follows 
  max 
ei 
 i 
 
 
Xn 
j 
e 
 
j 
 
 
 
 
  ei 
Simple computation reveals the first-order conditions to be 
  e 
 
i 
   i 
 
 
Xn 
j 
e 
 
j 
 
 
 
 
 
and summing over all i in   and simplifying  we see that 
  Xn 
j 
e 
 
j 
   
 
 
 
 
Xn 
j

We may substitute   in   to conclude that 
  ei    
 
   
 
 
 
 
Xn 
j 
 
 
 
j 
 
 
 
 
 
Equipped with these equations  we may now obtain a closed form for the surplus S 
 
  in

The problem that we are interested in thus reduces to the seemingly innocuous maximization 
exercise  maximize S 
 
  as given by   with respect to  
It is possible to use the equations   and   to run some simple consistency checks 
Propositions   and   may be obtained by the taking of appropriate limits in the above 
maximization exercise  The more general issue is to calculate the values of   to intermediate 
problems 
We do not have a complete solution to this problem  But here are some observations

Proposition   If       then perfect equality maximizes constrained surplus 
Proof  Let                n  be a vector of nonnegative shares summing to unity  We already

  Notice that   is only well-defined if       which we shall 
assume in what follows   The logarithmic case       will be discussed at the end of the 
proof 
We will use this expression to establish the proposition  To this end  let us compute the 
derivative of S 
 
  with respect to any one of the shares  say  i 
  This derivative is given by 
   
  S

Note  we will be done if we can show that whenever  i    k 
  then  i     k 
  For this 
would mean that a small transfer from the higher share to the lower share would raise total 
surplus  Because the terms within curly brackets in   are unchanged in this comparison 
it will suffice to show that the function

But this inequality follows from direct inspection  and we are done 
Notice that the logarithmic case       remains uncovered  I believe this should be established 
by separate computation 
Proposition   If       there exist population sizes for which equal division cannot be optimal 
Proof  As a construction for the proof  set up the equal minority problem with m people 
receiving equal shares  m  call this vector  m  Then it is easy to see that

I will now show that S 
 
 m    S

  which proves that perfect equality is 
impossible when n exceeds m 
  To this end  we pretend that m is a continuous variable in 
  It will suffice to show that the derivative of S m  with respect to m is negative for all 
m   m 
  Differentiating   with respect to m  we need to show that 
 b    m    b    
 To check the observation for   be a little careful  First note that when         can be written as  
 
  and 
now examine this 
  Inequality and Incentives 
for all m   m 
  Using the definition of b and m 
  this is a matter of simple algebra 
The simulations  see below  show a strange area where two players receive different shares 
It looks subtle  The following proposition takes us part of the way towards resolving these 
strange issues 
Proposition   There can be no more than two distinct positive values of the share in any 
constrained optimum  Moreover  there can be no more than one person endowed with the lower of the 
two positive values of the share 
Proof  To prove this  recall the expression for  i  in   and note the following 
Lemma   Let   be a share vector  If  i  and  k 
  are different for two positive values  i and 
 k 
in the share vector  then that share vector cannot be a constrained optimum 
The proof of this lemma is trivial  Simply transfer shares from the one with lower  -value 
to the one with the higher  -value  Since the shares in question are both positive  there is no 
constraint to doing this in any  direction  we please 
Given Lemma   our question boils down to this  for how many distinct and positive 
values of x can  x  have the same value  Recall that  x  is defined in  
it may be 
written as 
   x     x 
    Cx 
 
where 
C

Now we prove the following observation  the function  x  for x     is  single-peaked   though 
not necessarily concave  first rising  then falling 
To show this be a little careful  because the function is not necessarily strictly concave  try 
      But it is easy to do  details omitted 
Now we are done with the first part of the proposition  Such a function can exhibit the same 
value for at most two distinct points in the domain 
To complete the proof  let a denote the smaller of the two positive values of the share  We will 
show that if two  or more  persons are given a  we can improve the surplus by transferring 
some share from one of them to the other  To this end  think of the share of these two 
individuals as variables x and y   Initially  x   y   a  Holding all other shares constant  we 
may think of the aggregate surplus simply as a function S x  y  For some       we know 
from the mean value theorem for multivariate functions  see  e g  Hoffman   Section 
  Theorem   that 
  S a     a       S a  a     S x  y    S x  y 
 
It is true that the shares also appear within the curly brackets  But this does not matter as we are simply 
comparing for different shares  over the cross-section  and the share vector does not change 
Inequality and Incentives  
where superscripts denote the appropriate partial derivatives  and x  can be chosen to be 
strictly larger than y 
  Now we know that 
  S x  y     x 
    C x  y x 
 
 
and 
  S x  y     y 
    C x  y y 
 
 
where C x  y  is exactly the same C as before  see definition just following   but with 
two of the arguments made explicit to remind the reader that x  and y  enter there as well 
Recall now that 
 z 
    C a  a z 
 
is strictly increasing in z around z   a  It follows that the same is true of the slightly perturbed 
function 
 z 
    C x  y z 
 
around z   a  Using this information in   and   it is therefore easy to see that for 
      but small enough 
S x  y    S x  y 
Applying this inequality to   we may conclude that S a     a       S a  a  surplus is 
increased by a small transfer between two persons with the same lower share  and the proof 
is complete 
Tentative Notes on Simulations 
Unfortunately  we could not obtain analytically the parameter values for which the unequal 
pair dominates equal minority with m       We therefore turned towards simulations  the 
results of which we now examine  The following observations were obtained through the 
simulations 
 i  The area in the parameter space     such that the inefficiency-minimizing distribution 
of shares corresponds to the equal minority case is large  In other words  for most values 
of the parameters  sharing equally among a limited  smaller than n  number of agents is 
the least inefficient distribution of shares  When    
 
 
  perfect equality is the  second-best 
optimal distribution of shares 
 ii  There is a non-trivial area in the parameter space     such that inefficiency is minimized 
by distributing shares unequally  and between only two agents  However  the two shares 
tend to be more equal as the degree of complementarity between efforts increases 
 iii  For       the optimal distribution of shares corresponds to the one of perfect 
inequality  where one agent concentrates all the shares  for all values of   Thus  if 
substitutability between efforts is high enough  perfect inequality a la Olson appears 
to minimize inefficiency  This is a subtle observation that requires greater analytical 
investigation 
 The reason for this is that it is possible to take x     a  a     and y     a     a  While the statement of the theorem 
in Hoffman   does not make this clear  the proof   see last two lines   does 
  Inequality and Incentives 
  Egalitarianism and Incentives 
Note  What follows has been taken from Ray and Ueda   and needs to be shortened for 
the purpose of these lecture notes 
A social planner s concern for egalitarianism might lead to a dilution of incentives  and 
therefore a loss in efficiency  In an important class of situations  the efficiency loss arises 
because the planner cannot credibly commit to a future course of action  such as the 
decision not to tax an individual or group making efficiency-enhancing investments  So 
these investments are not made  or more generally  undersupplied 
Consider  then  the following class of situations  A group of agents is collectively engaged in 
a joint production activity  where the output from production is to be distributed among the 
members of the group  The agents  represented by a social planner  perhaps  are interested 
in maximizing the value of a Bergson-Samuelson social welfare function defined on their 
own utilities  However  while this welfare function represents their social values  individual 
actions are taken on an entirely selfish basis  Suppose that to achieve the desired outcome 
each agent must take an observable action  followed by some collective action   the  social 
planner s move  Suppose  moreover  that a collective action  contingent on individual 
decisions  cannot be credibly committed in advance 
Specifically  define a soft mechanism to be one that specifies a second best division of the 
output  relative to the social welfare function  conditional on every possible input vector  We 
wish to compare the resulting equilibria of the  soft game  so induced  with the first best 
under the very same welfare function 
  Model 
  Technology and Individual Preferences Consider a group of n individuals  n    
producing a single output  Output is produced by the joint efforts of these individuals 
according to the production function 
  Y   F e 
where e    e         en  is a  nonnegative  vector of efforts  We assume 
 A  F is continuous and concave with F      and differentiable whenever F     with  F e

Fi e     
Each individual has preferences over pairs of consumption  c  and leisure  l  We assume 
 A central example is the problem of allocating funds from a Central Government to different State Governments 
Typically  each state carries out a number of different expenditure programs  which are financed from central 
funds and state revenues  The Center would like to channel proportionately greater funds to the poorer states 
At the same time  the Center would like to induce each state to carry out activities that will raise per capita income 
in that state  But the former goal places limits on the punishments that a Center can credibly impose on a state 
for not taking actions to further certain desired goals

Let E be the product of intervals   Li  over all i  Note that whenever e   E  we shall 
have li given by   for i             n  Keeping this in mind  define an outcome as a pair 
 c  e     c          cn   e         en  such that c     e   E  and

  Social Preferences The social planner is presumed to possess Bergson-Samuelson 
preferences satisfying standard restrictions 
 A   i  Society s preferences are representable by a C

    R  defined on 
 n-tuples of consumption-leisure vectors  This welfare function is strictly quasiconcave  Moreover 
for each l   E and each i  ci 
is not an inferior good under the function W  l

by part  i  and  A  such that W c  l

  First Best The planner would like to maximize social welfare  This is achieved by 
an outcome  c  e  that maximizes W c  L   e  where L    L  L          Ln  is the vector of labor 
endowments  From Assumptions   and   it follows that there is a unique outcome  c 
 
  e 
 
 
that solves this problem  Call this outcome the first best 
Some minor restrictions on the first-best are summarized in the following assumption 
 FB  There is at least one individual i such that e 
i 
    and l 
i 
  Li   e 
 
i 
    Moreover  the first best 
output is larger than the optimal output that would be chosen by any one individual acting on his 
own  F e 
 
    F           e j 
              where e j solves 
max ej Lj 
u 
j 
 F           ej 
              Lj   ej  Finally  under the first-best  each individual obtains 
at least as much utility as total inaction  which yields ui 
  Li 
  The Soft Mechanism The idea of a no-commitment mechanism  or soft mechanism 
is based on the postulate that the planner cannot avoid maximizing welfare ex post  even 
though this may be detrimental to the maximization of welfare ex ante  Formally  for each 
given vector e   E  consider the problem 
  max

W c  L   e

 All the restrictions are not used in all the propositions  but the conditions are so minor that we do not feel it 
useful to separate this list into separate components 
  Inequality and Incentives 
By  A  and  A  there is a unique vector c e  that solves   We will refer to  c e  e  as an ex 
post outcome  This captures  in an extreme way  the inability to impose arbitrary punishments 
on deviants  The lack of commitment creates limitations on the incentive mechanisms that 
can be used to stimulate production 
The collection of ex post outcomes  c e  e  for e   E  induces a soft game in the obvious way 
Player i chooses ei     Li  If the vector e is chosen  i consumes ci e  thus generating the

  An Additional Restriction We now have sufficient terminology to introduce an 
additional joint assumption on technology and preferences  which will be used to derive 
one of the main results  To motivate this assumption  first consider a standard property of 
the first best outcome  which can be easily verified  If e

The intuition is simple  If this inequality did not hold  i s effort could be raised a little with 
all the additional output being credited to him  His utility would be higher  with every other 
utility remaining constant  Social welfare goes up  a contradiction to the fact that we have a 
first best outcome to start with 
The additional assumption that we wish to make is related closely to   Specifically  we

 A  For each ex post outcome  c e  e  such that F e    F e 
 
  there is i with ei     and 
  u 
i 
c 
 ci 
  li Fi e    u 
i 
l 
 ci 
  li 
where ci e    ci    
This assumption looks plausible  because as output moves above the first best  we would 
expect that marginal products do not increase  while the marginal rate of substitution 
between consumption and leisure tilts in favor of leisure  Thus if   already holds at 
the first best  we expect this relationship to be maintained  for at least one individual  for 
outcomes with higher output 
However  it is only fair to point out  A  is not automatically implied by  A  -  A 
However  experimentation with different functional forms suggests that it is implied by a 
large subclass of welfare functions  individual preferences and production technologies 
For instance  suppose  in addition to  A A  that individual utilities are separable as 
the sum of concave functions of consumption and leisure  that total output is some concave 
smooth function of the sum of individual efforts  and that the social welfare function has a 
separable and concave representation in utilities 
Consider some ex post outcome  c e  e  distinct from the first best  but with the property 
that at least as much output is being produced as in the first best  F e    F e 
 
  There must 
be some individual i with ei   e 
 
i 
  In the case under consideration  it will be the case that 
at least one such individual gets ci e    c 
 
i 
 remember that at least as much output is being 
Inequality and Incentives  
produced  Furthermore  since output is no lower  marginal product cannnot have increased 
relative to the first-best  Putting all this together with   and using the convexity properties 
of preferences and technology  it should be the case that 
u 
i

for this individual  which is  
Consider  therefore  the following formalization of the separable case

is additively separable in  c  l   ii  F e  is of the form f e            en  for some 
f   R    R  and  iii  V is separable in individual utilities 
Our motivating argument above shows that under  A A   A  implies  A 
  Egalitarianism and Incentives 
  Egalitarianism Yields Underproduction 
Proposition   Under  A  -  A  and  FB  the first best cannot be achieved as some equilibrium 
of the soft game  Moreover  if  A  holds  every equilibrium of the soft game must involve 
underproduction 
Proposition   verifies an intuitive conjecture  when a team cannot precommit to 
adequately punish deviants  the first best cannot be achieved  Specifically  in this model 
there is underproduction relative to the first best 
It is perhaps worth mentioning that while Proposition   appears intuitive  especially 
because it is related to other inefficiency notions  such as the Marshallian inefficiency 
of sharecropping  or the holdup problem  it is far from being obviously true in the 
present context  For instance  if individual utility has a separable linear representation 
in consumption  the proposition is  in general  false  there are equilibria that attain the first 
best  Moreover  without  A  whether there is underproduction or not is an open question 
Most significantly  the assumptions of Proposition   do not cover the case of Rawlsian 
social preferences  and as we shall see in the next section  our proposition fails in this case 
It might help  therefore  to sketch the proof of Proposition   for a special case  Assume 
that individual preferences have a strictly concave representation that is separable in 
consumption and leisure  and that given this representation  the Bergson-Samuelson welfare 
function has a representation that is strictly concave and separable in individual utilities 
Furthermore  assume that total output is a concave  increasing function f of the sum of 
individual efforts  This is the case covered by  A 
Now consider an ex post outcome  c  e  with overproduction relative to the first best  Someone 
must be putting in more effort relative to the first best  Call that someone i  Evaluated at 
the first best consumption vector  i must now have a higher marginal weight in the social 
welfare function than he had before  In the ex post outcome under consideration  therefore  i 
 
Such utility functions are ruled out by the assumption that leisure is a normal good  see  A 
  Inequality and Incentives 
must enjoy more consumption  because total output is not lower  Putting all this information 
together with the convexity of preferences and technology  it is easy to see that 
  u 
i 
c 
f 
 
 e            en    u 
i 
l 
which just means that  A  is automatically satisfied in this special case 
Now  suppose that i reduces his effort level a tiny bit  Perform the thought experiment of 
cutting i s consumption by exactly the resulting fall in output  By the inequality   this 
has a nonnegative first-order effect on i 
 
s utility  If the outcome is to be a Nash equilibrium 
therefore  i s true consumption decline must be at least of this order  But now note that this 
decline must have a first-order effect on i s marginal utility of consumption  which rises 
Moreover  by the supposition that i is no better off  the marginal welfare contribution of his 
utility is no lower  It is now easy to check that in this new situation  the first-order conditions 
for ex post welfare maximization are destroyed  For because i is being made to take at least 
the entire output loss  as we have argued above  there must be some other individual whose 
consumption is no lower  For this other person  exactly the reverse changes must occur in 
the marginal conditions  So  if the first order conditions were holding earlier  as they must 
have  they cannot be holding now  This contradicts ex post welfare maximization  and 
proves that the original outcome could not have been an equilibrium 
   But Not With a Rawlsian Planner Our main theme relates the degree of egalitarianism 
to the degree of efficiency failure  It will be convenient to begin by exploring the most 
extreme form of egalitarianism  Rawlsian social preferences  In a later section  we will carry 
out the more complicated exercise of varying the welfare function over different degrees of 
egalitarianism 
Observe that the Rawlsian case is not covered by Proposition   That result rests on a 
postulate that is seemingly so innocuous that we have not emphasized it in the discussion 
 though  of course  it is formally stated in  A  It is that social welfare is strictly increasing 
in every utility level  for each vector of utilities  Rawlsian social preferences do not satisfy 
this condition  Indeed  this observation has striking consequences  as we shall see 
We first define Rawlsian preferences  To do so we need a benchmark comparison  This is 
summarized in the following assumption 
 R  Society is indifferent between the complete inaction of any two individuals  Thus if the Rawlsian 
welfare is written as 
  V u    min 
i 
u 
i 
where utilities have already been normalized so that ui 
  Li    u 
j 
  Lj  for all i and j 
The first best Rawlsian optimum involves the maximization of the expression in  
subject to the constraints that u 
i   u 
i 
 ci 
  li  for all i and that  c  e  is an outcome  Just as before 
there is a unique first best outcome  call it  c 
 
 e 
 
 
Ex post outcomes are defined exactly as they were earlier  It is easy to see that for each e   E 
there is a unique consumption vector c e  that solves the ex post maximization problem 
Inequality and Incentives  
The collection of ex post outcomes induces a soft game just as before  and we may study its 
equilibria 
Proposition   Under  A   A   FB  and  R  the Rawlsian first best is an equilibrium of 
the Rawlsian soft game  Furthermore  any equilibrium which gives at least one agent strictly more 
utility than the utility from inaction must be the Rawlsian first best outcome 
  One might wonder whether the strikingly positive result of Proposition   is due to the 
fact that the Rawlsian egalitarian optimum is so devoid of efficiency properties that we do 
not have any incentive problem at all to maintain it  But this is not the case  For instance 
consider any special case of this model that is symmetric across all agents  It is easy to see 
that the first best outcome is invariant across all symmetric quasi-concave welfare functions 
including the Rawlsian one 
  There is only one qualification in Proposition   To prove that an equilibrium must be 
the Rawlsian first-best  we assume that at least one individual receives strictly more utility 
than he receives from inaction  There may exist an equilibrium involving total inaction  This 
will happen if the technology has the property that F e      whenever n  components of e 
equal zero  On the other hand  if the technology is such that output depends on the sum of 
the efforts  and if right-hand marginal utilities are defined and strictly positive everywhere 
then our qualification can be dispensed with 
Thus  in contrast to standard intuition  extreme egalitarianism might actually has pleasing 
incentive properties  Egalitarianism applies not only to the choice of the social optimum 
but in the treatment of deviants from the optimum  A greater concern for egalitarianism 
goes hand in hand with the ability to credibly mete out stronger punishments 
Apart from the technicalities  the proof of Proposition   is very simple and general 
Under convexity of the feasible set and preferences  the Rawlsian criterion has the following 
property  All individual utilities move in the same direction from one ex post outcome to 
another  Consequently  the Rawlsian first best is always an equilibrium of the Rawlsian soft 
game  For if someone could improve his utility by a deviation  he would improve the utility 
of everyone else in the process  This would contradict the fact that the earlier outcome was 
first best 
The second part of the result   that every equilibrium must be first best   is model-specific 
in two respects  The convexity and the differentiability features of the model must both be 
exploited  These are used to guarantee that if an allocation is not first best  then there is 
some small  unilateral change in someone s effort level that creates an ex post outcome with 
 Our requirement that the production function be differentiable at positive output is used in the proof  Concave 
increasing production functions which produce no output when n  effort components equal zero are not  right 
hand  differentiable at   even though all partial  right hand  derivatives may exist at  
 
It should be pointed out that this joint movement of utilities in the same direction is also a feature of the case in 
which utilities have a separable linear representation in consumption  To see this  let u 
i 
 c  l    aic   bi l  where 
ai     and bi 
is an increasing  smooth  concave function  Assume that V u    v u            vn un  where each vi 
is smooth  increasing  and strictly concave  Now look at the ex post outcomes of this model  If all consumptions 
are strictly positive  then the necessary and sufficient conditions characterizing ex post optimality are that for 
all i  j  v 
 
i 
 u 
i 
 ci 
  li ai   v 
 
j 
 u 
j 
 cj 
  lj ai 
  The co-movement of utilities should now be apparent  So in this case as well 
the first best can be supported as an equilibrium of the soft game 
  Inequality and Incentives 
a higher Rawlsian value  Again  using the Rawlsian criterion and the equal-utility property 
yielded by convexity  the individual who makes the change must participate in its benefits 
thereby destroying the equilibrium possibilities of the given outcome 
  Changing Egalitarianism The result of the previous section  and the discussion 
following it  suggest an even stronger observation  that as the extent of egalitarianism 
increases  the degree of underproduction should monotonically decline  Proposition  
would be the limiting case of such an observation  The purpose of this section is to 
demonstrate such a possibility 
We consider a symmetric version of our model  described formally as follows  First  any 
permutation of e produces the same output level as F e  Second  every individual s 
preferences is represented by the same function u  Finally  the social welfare function is 
symmetric 
  W c  l    V  u c  l    u cn  ln 
where V is symmetric  We will fix the individual representation u  and analyze the effect of 
changing egalitarianism by altering the form of V in a manner made precise below 
The following assumption  in addition to those already maintained  will be made on the 
fixed cardinal representation  u  of individual preferences 
 A  There exists a cardinal representation such that u is strictly concave in c  and V is quasiconcave 
in u 
 
We begin by discussing how to compare the  degree of egalitarianism  among different 
V s  or more generally  among different social welfare orderings on vectors of individual 
utility  Our definition  while not formally requiring symmetric social welfare orderings  is 
best viewed in this background  Let S and S 
 
be two social welfare orderings for utility 
vectors u  We will say that S 
 
is at least as egalitarian as S if for all u  v   Rn 
  and for all i and 
j  the condition 
  uk   vk 
for k   i  j  vSu  and  vi   vj 
     ui   uj 
 
implies vS 
 u 
That is  S 
 
is more egalitarian than S if it prefers every redistribution plan to narrow the 
difference between two individuals  utility that R prefers as well   This can be viewed as an 
extension of the Pigou-Dalton principle for utility distributions  see  for example  Moulin 
  applied to a comparison of any two social welfare orderings 
Some remarks on this last observation will clarify our definition  Observe that under our 
definition  a social welfare ordering S 
 
is at least as egalitarian as the utilitarian welfare 
ordering if the condition 
uk   vk 
for k   i  j  ui   uj   vi   vj 
  and  vi   vj 
     ui   uj 
 
 The fix on a cardinal representation that is strictly concave is not necessary for the results  as long as  A  is 
maintained  but it greatly simplifies the writing of the proofs 
Inequality and Incentives  
implies vS 
 u  Note that the condition above is just a specialization of   when S is 
the utilitarian ordering  Specializing even further so that ui   uj   vi   vj 
in the above 
condition  we obtain the Pigou-Dalton principle for utility distributions  In other words  a 
social welfare ordering which is at least as egalitarian as the utilitarian ordering satisfies the 
Pigou-Dalton principle  Our suggested relation is therefore an extension of this idea 
The argument above suggests that as we progressively move  towards egalitarianism  in 
this ordering  we obtain social welfare functions that are  more willing  to trade off total 
utility for interpersonal equality 
This definition  and the subsequent discussion leads to two general observations  First 
in the class of social welfare functions considered in this paper  every such function is at 
least as egalitarian as the utilitarian function  Second  the Rawlsian function is at least 
as egalitarian as any of these social welfare functions  In short  the utilitarian and the 
Rawlsian social welfare orderings are two extremes of the social welfare functions we are 
considering  in the spectrum of the degree of egalitarianism defined here 
In our model  social welfare orderings are given by the functions satisfying  A  and  A 
which includes differentiability  Let V and V 
 
be two such symmetric functions  Then we can 
show that V 
 
is at least as egalitarian as V if and only if 
  For all u and for all i  j       n  ui   uj  
Vi 
 
Vj 
   
Vi 
Vj 
We omit a proof of this result  it is available on request  But the interpretation should 
be quite natural  When one individual j has a lower utility than another individual i  the 
 more egalitarian  social welfare function assigns a higher  relative  marginal welfare to i 
The social marginal rate of substitution between i and j is tilted in favor of j by the more 
egalitarian welfare function 
To obtain a clearer idea of the partial ordering proposed here  consider two classes of social 
welfare functions  The first is the Atkinson family  which is represented by the form 
   Xn 
i 
u 
 
i 
 
 
 This is because increasing  strictly quasiconcave welfare functions will indeed rank v over u whenever the 
specialization of condition   discussed in the text happens to hold 
 This is easily seen as follows  Suppose that for some social welfare ordering S  and utility vectors u and v 
condition   holds but nevertheless  u is preferred by the Rawlsian ordering to v  This means  in particular 
that min ui 
  uj    min vi 
  vj  But because  ui   uj 
     vi   vj 
  this implies that  ui 
  uj  vector dominates  vi 
  vj  But 
now we have a contradiction to the assumption that vSu 
 It is worth noting that the asserted equivalence is an analogue of a result in Moulin   Lemma   which 
characterizes a differentiable social welfare function  called a  collective utility function  that satisfies the 
Pigou-Dalton principle for utility distributions 
  Inequality and Incentives 
where         It is easy to check that higher degrees of egalitarianism correspond 
to lower values of   In particular  the case       yields the utilitarian  and       the 
Rawlsian social welfare ordering 
The second class is the  constant absolute risk-aversion  family  which is given by the form 
   
Xn 
i 
exp ui 
where         A higher value of   is associated with a more egalitarian function  and 
the two extreme values of     and   again give the utilitarian and the Rawlsian social 
orderings respectively 
Now  let us return to the model  An outcome is symmetric if all individuals work equally hard 
and consume equally  In the symmetric model  symmetric effort by individuals induces a 
symmetric outcome  in which c e   e     c    c  and c  
 
n 
F e   e  The first best  c 
 
 e 
 
  is 
also a symmetric allocation  and the allocation is independent of the social welfare function 
We will restrict our discussion to the class of symmetric equilibria of the soft game 
In what follows  it will be convenient to consider a modified soft game where all but the first 
individual choose the same level of effort  Then the ex-post outcome assigns the same level 
of consumption for those providing this effort  Denote the generated levels of consumption 
by 
   c e e  V  c e e  V 
where V is the social welfare function determining consumption  and e and c are the common 
values for all but the first individual  The first individual s best response to e is the set of 
solutions to the problem of maximizing his indirect utility function with respect to e   
  L  Denote this set by B e  V  B e  V  is a compact-valued and upper hemi-continuous 
correspondence of e   We will need to further assume 
 A  u c e e  V  L   e  is single-peaked with respect to e 
Then  B e  V  is convex-valued and the existence of a symmetric equilibrium for each V is 
guaranteed 
By the degree of underproduction in any outcome  we refer to the difference between the 
first-best production level and the level of aggregate production under that outcome  The 
following proposition establishes that while the degree of underproduction is positive  the 
degree of underproduction must fall with rising egalitarianism 
Proposition   Assume a symmetric model satisfying  A A   A   A  and  FB  Then 
every symmetric equilibrium of the soft game involves underproduction  Now consider two welfare 
 It should be noted that our maintained assumptions do not automatically yield  A  However  all parametric 
forms that we have tried satisfy this assumption 
Inequality and Incentives  
functions V and V 
  where V 
at least as egalitarian as V  Then  for each symmetric equilibrium 
under V  there exists a symmetric equilibrium under V 
such that the degree of underproduction is 
not more for the latter 
This verifies that the Rawlsian case discussed in Proposition   is not an exception or some 
quirky failure of continuity  For symmetric equilibria of the symmetric model  increased 
egalitarianism never increases the degree of underproduction 
  Extensions  We briefly consider some extensions  as well as possible objections to 
the setting in which these results have been derived 
  Sinking past differences  In computing ex post optima  why do teams take account 
of the sunk efforts already incurred by its members  It may be argued that bygones are 
bygones  and that the social welfare function should ignore this  This point of view may be 
identified with the assertion that individual utilities  should  be separable in consumption 
and leisure  and that the social welfare function  should  be utilitarian  At least  that is 
the only way to justify the assertion if one sticks to the Bergson-Samuelson setting  Such 
particular functional forms are already accommodated as a special case of the paper  and 
if one insists on such an interpretation  an entire class of welfare functions  including the 
Rawlsian function  is simply removed from consideration 
On the other hand  one might take the sinking of past differences as a primitive  simply 
asserting that ex post output is shared equally  in a symmetric model  irrespective of the 
welfare function  We find it difficult to see what might justify such an assumption  Consider 
any resource allocation problem  As long as resources are not allocated to everybody at 
exactly the same point of time  this point of view leads to absurd allocations 
If one were to admit such a structure for the sake of argument  inefficiencies will always 
arise  of course  But even then  it can be shown that as long as some weight is given to the 
past  Proposition   will continue to hold  In particular  the Rawlsian welfare function will 
exhibit the lowest degree of underproduction 
  Emotions and credible punishments  One might proceed in the exactly the opposite 
direction to   Deviants that do not adhere to the desired outcome might enjoy an entirely 
different  and reduced  weight in the ex post welfare function  Emotions such as anger 
or social disapproval might induce such changes  and in so doing  lend credibility to 
punishments  for similar ideas  see  e g  Frank   It is to be expected that the degree 
of inefficiency will be lowered in the presence of these emotions  But even so  as long as 
the first best is thereby not automatically achieved  more egalitarian welfare functions will 
possess better efficiency properties 
  The observability of effort  The results of this paper rest critically on the assumption 
that efforts are observable  We suspect that the results would extend to noisy observability 
 It is possible to find even stronger versions of this proposition in special cases  For instance  if the best-response 
correspondence is single-valued  and social welfare functions are in the Atkinson class  we can show that 
increased egalitarianism strictly lowers the maximal degree of underproduction  The qualification  maximal 
is due to the fact that equilibrium may not be unique 
  Inequality and Incentives 
though we have not checked this  Of course  if efforts are not observable at all  the results 
cease to have any relevance 
  Repeated Relationships  In a dynamic situation  teams would recognize that a departure 
from the soft mechanism will serve them well in the longer run  It may be of interest to 
study such repeated relationships  But as a prelude to that study  it is surely important to 
analyze the  one-shot  relationship without precommitment  which is exactly what we do 
here 
  Discussion  While the connections between egalitarianism and inefficiency has long 
been a subject of debate  there have been surprisingly few attempts to model the exact nature 
of the tradeoff  To be sure  the sources of various tradeoffs are manifold in nature  This paper 
investigates one potential source  and shows that the commonly held intuition is not valid 
at least in this case 
Specifically  this paper studies the idea that egalitarianism fails to uphold proper incentives 
because credible punishments are thereby destroyed  This statement really has two parts to 
it  one is the familiar  dilemma of the Samaritan  induced by the inability to precommit 
Organizations that cannot precommit  yet derive their sense of goal-fulfillment or welfare from 
the welfare of its members  are particularly prone to these potential inefficiencies  Indeed 
organizational structures where the source of utility for the  principal  is directly opposed 
to that for the  agent  will certainly do better  in terms of efficiency  compared to the 
structures considered here  This is the intuition upheld by Proposition   An inability to 
precommit the reward function results in inefficiency  While the particularresult proved is  to 
our knowledge  new  there is nothing particularly surprising or novel about the underlying 
theme 
But this is only one half of the idea  The second part goes further  It states that egalitarian 
organizations faced with the inability to precommit are doubly cursed  they are inefficient on 
the additional count that they cripple the incentive system  already weakened by the inability 
to precommit  even further  In this paper  we argue that this assertion is wrong  Increased 
egalitarianism restores incentives that are damaged by the lack of commitment  Proposition 
  Indeed  in the extreme case of Rawlsian egalitarianism  the precommitment and 
no-precommitment yield exactly the same first-best outcomes 
The results in this section are provocative on two counts  First  they might inspire greater 
interest in a challenging and crucially important area of research  the connections between 
the ethic of equality and the yardstick of aggregate performance  such as GNP growth  The 
second aspect is one that we have not emphasized in this paper  but of great interest  we 
believe  This is the connection with the theory of implementation  By far the dominant 
 Indeed  in the usual principal-agent setup the problem is trivial  If efforts are observable  the organization 
is best off using a forcing contract  The contract demands that each individual must supply  at least  his first 
best effort level  If this effort level is indeed supplied by all individuals  all individuals receive the first best 
output division  If  however  these effort levels are not forthcoming  the contract promises dire consequences for 
the individuals who have deviated  These threats indeed implement the first best  at least as one equilibrium 
and there is no incentive problem worth serious analysis  Authors such as Holmstrom  Holmstrom   have 
argued that the existence of a residual claimant  capitalist  manager  creates a credible threat to carry out these 
punishments  such as retention of produced output  in the event of breach 
Inequality and Incentives  
approach in this literature presumes that the planner can implement outcomes without 
regard to ex post credibility  But there are many situations where it is natural to constrain 
mechanisms off the equilibrium path by the provision that they should not be suboptimal 
relative to the actions that have been taken and observed  and the social welfare function of 
the planner  This may have some bearing on narrowing the class of allowable mechanisms 
in implementation contexts 
  Proofs  Note  Equation numbering needs to be changed

Then such an outcome cannot be an equilibrium of the soft game 
Proof  Suppose that  c e  e     c  e  is an ex post outcome with F e      Denote by Wi c  l 
the partial derivative of W with respect to ci 
  Then  under  A A  and using the ex post 
maximization problem    c  e  must satisfy the following property  if ck     then for all

with equality whenever cj    
We need a slightly stronger implication than   Let i be such that ei     and suppose 
that there is some k with ck     Suppose  further  that there exists       such that for all 
e 
 
i 
   ei    ei  the ex post consumption vector c e

  has c 
 
k 
    Then  indeed  we 
can say that   holds for this k even if ck     We exclude the verification of this simple 
observation 
Now  suppose that  contrary to the lemma  this outcome is an equilibrium of the soft game 
Let M be the set of all indices j such that either cj     or with the property that there is      
such that for all e 
 
i 
   ei  ei  the ex post consumption vector c e 
 
i 
  e i    c 
  has c 
 
j 
    We are 
going to consider the effect  on i s utility  of a small reduction in ei by differential methods 
By the maximum theorem  and the uniqueness of ex post consumption  given effort  c e 
is a continuous function  Therefore the set M is all that counts for the analysis  and for all 
k  j   M    holds with equality 
Note first that because  c  e  is an equilibrium and ei     we have ci     Consequently  i   M 
Without loss of generality  number the indices in M as           m  and let i be rechristened with 
the index   We now claim that m     Suppose not  Then  because  c  e  is an equilibrium  we 
must have ej     for all j     Therefore  because F e    F e 
 
  and because we have assumed 
that the first best output is larger than the output of any individual acting completely on his 
own  we must have

so that   proves that a small reduction in e  will raise the utility of   under the new ex

the proof of the lemma 
Proof of Proposition   Observe that the first best allocation is indeed an ex post outcome 
with positive output  satisfying   in Lemma   Given the assumption that at the first

i 
        follows as a necessary condition describing the first 
best  By Lemma   this outcome cannot be an equilibrium of the soft game 
If  A  holds  then consider any ex post outcome with F e    F e 
 
  It follows right away 
from  A  that   is satisfied  By Lemma   this outcome cannot be an equilibrium of the 
soft game 
Proof of Proposition   For any outcome  c  e  define its Rawlsian value as R c  e

The reason is that for each i  either c

Therefore  if   were not true  we could always improve the Rawlsian value of the outcome 
by small changes 
Given this claim  we first prove that the first best outcome is indeed an equilibrium  Suppose 
not  Then for some i  there is ei     Li  such that 
  u

Because u

that 
  R c  e    u

 ci 
  li 
For if not  the Rawlsian value of  c  e  can be improved by only changing the consumption 
allocation  a contradiction to the fact that  c  e  is an ex post outcome  use the fact that ci    
Combining     and   we have 
R c  e    R c 
 
  e 
 
 
but this contradicts the fact that  c 
 
 e 
 
  is the Rawlsian first best 
Now we prove the second part of the proposition  First  we show that if  c  e  is an 
equilibrium  then for all i             n 
  R c  e    u 
i 
 ci

Suppose this is not true  Then for some pairi  j  u

 by an earlier argument  that ci     Consequently  u

j 
  Lj 
where the last equality follows from normalization  But then   c  e  cannot be an equilibrium 
for j can guarantee himself at least u 
j 
  Lj  by deviating 
With this established  we return to the main proof  Suppose that the proposition is false 
Then there exists an equilibrium  c  e     c 
 
  e 
 
  such that at least one player gets strictly 
more utility than inaction  By virtue of   and assumption  R  it follows that every player 
gets strictly more than inaction  This observation will be used below 
Because the first best is unique  R c 
 
  e 
 
    R c  e  Define e t    te       t e 
 
for t

 A    and   Using   it follows that for all t       and all i

Now we claim that the following is true 
There exists j such that either  i  ej   Lj and u

  lj  or  iii  ej     and u 
j 
c 
 cj

To prove the claim  first recall that each player gets strictly more than inaction at  c  e  so 
that by  A   u

 ci

that for all i

or equivalently  for all i 
   ci t    ci     ei t    ei

c 
   
Now  if the claim is false  then  noting that ei t      Li  for all i  we can use   to deduce 
that 
 ci t    ci     ei t    ei Fi e     
Summing this inequality over all i  we have 
  F e t    F e     e t    e F e             en t    en Fn e 
Now observe that because  c  e  provides more utility than inaction  F e      But then  
contradicts  A  which assumes that F is differentiable whenever F e      and that F is 
concave  This establishes the claim 
Pick j as given by the claim  If part  i  of the claim is true  notice that because  c  e  is an 
equilibrium  cj     Then  a small reduction in ej makes j strictly better off even if j pays for 
the entire reduction in output from his own consumption  This improvement in j s utility 
persists even if j must pay a small additional amount to each of the other agents  This proves 
that the Rawlsian value of  c  e  can be improved by a unilateral change made by j  by going 
to an ex post outcome  c 
 
  e 
 
   where e 
  differs from e only in the jth component  That is 
R c 
 
  e 
 
    R c  e  But note that  as a result  u

  e 
 
    R c  e    u 
j 
 cj 
  lj   where the 
last equality uses   This contradicts the supposition that  c  e  is an equilibrium 
Finally  if parts  ii  or  iii  of the claim are true  use the same argument as above  if 
u 
j 
c 
 cj 
  lj Fj e    u

l 
 cj 
  lj  or its reverse  increase ej  if u 
j 
c 
 cj 
  lj Fj e    u 
j 
l 
 cj 
  lj  to arrive at 
a contradiction 
This completes the proof of the proposition 
Proof of Proposition   By our assumptions  the first best is symmetric and has

It follows from the first-order conditions characterizing the first best that

Moreover  these hold for all i  It follows from Lemma   that no symmetric e   e 
 
can be an 
equilibrium of the soft game 
To prove the remainder of the proposition  fix a common utility level u  for all but the 
first individual  and let u  denote the utility level of individual   Then by applying the 
characterization of increased egalitarianism for smooth welfare functions  we see that

The social planner chooses consumption to maximize V on   Let us introduce some 
notation  We will denote by U e  V  the utility of agent   when the action taken by him is 
e  the welfare function is V  the action of the remaining agents is fixed at e  which is not 
explicitly carried in the notation  and the planner chooses ex-post consumption optimally 
Likewise  we will denote by U e  V  the utility of each of the other agents under exactly the

 Thus U e  V    u c e e  V  L   e  and U e  V    u c e e  V  L   e 
 In fact  this is the only point at which   is used in the proof 
Inequality and Incentives  
Suppose not  Then max B e  V 
 
    e  So there exists x    e  such that 
  U x  V 
 
    U e  V 
 
 
Because e   B e  V  it must be the case that 
  U x  V    U e  V 
Noting from   that U e  V    U e  V 
 
  we may combine   and   to obtain

In words    tells us that under V 
 
  player   is better off choosing x rather than e  At the 
same time    tells us that the rest of the players are also better off when player   chooses x 
instead of e  Thus a vector-inferior collection of efforts  x e         e  instead of  e         e   which 
in turn is lower than the first best  e 
 
         e 
 
  leads to a Pareto-improvement  Under our 
assumptions  this cannot be 
To see this more formally  note that if x   e   e

    U e  V     u  x e 
as long as  u  x e    u  By putting u    U x  V 
 
   u  x e    U x  V

contradict   This completes the proof of Claim  I 
Denote the maximal effort level among all symmetric equilibria under V 
  by e  We have 
already shown that e    e 
 
  We claim that 
 II  max B e  V 
 
    e for all e    e  L 
To see this  first observe that max B L  V 
 
    L simply by definition  Now suppose that the 
claim is false  Then for some e    e  L  max B e  V 
 
    e  Moreover  B  V 
 
  is convex-valued 
and upperhemicontinuous  But this establishes  using a simple argument analogous to the 
Intermediate Value Theorem  the existence of some e 
    e  such that e

  Moreover 
a fixed point of B    V 
 
  corresponds to a symmetric equilibrium  But this contradicts the 
definition of e  as the largest symmetric equilibrium effort level under V 
 
 
To complete the proof of the proposition  suppose that there exists e    e  L  which belongs to 
B e  V  Then max B e  V 
 
    e   max B e  V 
 
  where the first inequality follows from Claim 
 I  and the second inequality follows from Claim  II  This is a contradiction  and the proof 
is complete 
 
CHAPTER  
Notes on Inequality and Growth 
Begin with the conceptual links between inequality and growth  I will say a little bit on each 
  Inequality  Capital markets and Growth 
We ve already seen some of this from the earlier lectures  If capital markets are imperfect 
inefficiencies will arise from the fact that some individuals will be unable or unwilling to 
take the socially optimal action   the imperfections generate a high or infinite utility cost 
of doing so  Whether or not the final outcome is truly inefficient in the sense of dynamic 
Pareto-efficiency remains to be seen  Mookherjee and Ray   present some results to this 
effect  but it is certainly the case that output is lower than in the first-best 
Just what is needed to translate this sort of result into a lowerrate of growth is unclear  Ideally 
one would have to write down a model that allows for unbounded expansion   say  at some 
constant exponential rate   and then examine whether such an expansion rate is affected 
by the extent of capital market imperfections 
Such a model will also have to take account of the fixed cost barrier to setting up in a 
new occupation or business  This must also  move  with growth  otherwise all credit 
market imperfections must ultimately die away  One reason why such barriers may move 
in step with growth is that barriers are denominated in human capital  e g  education for an 
occupation or professional staff for a business  which is getting more expensive with growth 
for a related model  see Rigolini  
  Inequality  Public Allocation and Growth 
With high inequality  high-income or high-wealth individuals may garner a disproportionate 
share of public assets  But doing so may be inefficient from the point of view of future growth 
Here are three examples 
  Bhagwati and Desai   in their study of Indian planning  suggest that the richer 
business interests could easily buy up licences in a corrupt system  leading to the allocation 
  Notes on Inequality and Growth 
of valuable resources  such as import quotas  in their direction  New blood didn t get a 
chance  See also Banerjee   on bureaucratic corruption 
  Sokoloff and Engerman   and Acemoglu  Johnson and Robinson   have argued 
that an inefficient elite  once installed in power  might attempt to do all it can to keep the 
non-elite at bay  As Acemoglu   argues  they might set fiscal policy for three reasons   i 
to generate revenue off the back of non-elite businesses   ii  to make it more difficult for such 
non-elites to conduct business and this way lower the factor costs of production  e g  wage 
rates  for their own use  and  iii  they might tax non-elites in order to reduce the resources 
available for political opposition  This is more a theory of how inequality in the access to 
political power  which may in turn stem from economic inequality in the past  might stifle 
overall growth 
  Esteban and Ray   argue that public allocations may be severaly distorted even in the 
absence of any corrupt motive  Imagine a world in which governments   just like private 
agents   are unsure which direction the economy will  or should take  for instance  they 
may not know whether textiles or software or call centers will be the wave of the future  If 
the government has a limited supply of  licences   infrastructual support  subsisdies  tax 
breaks  etc  that it can hand out  then it is rational for them to do so to sectors that lobby 
hard  But hard lobbiers can be the outcome of individuals being highly productive  in which 
case the government should support the lobby  or people just being rich  in which case there 
is nothing to be gained from support  Thus high inequality distorts the lobbying signal 
and reduces the profitability of public allocation 
  Inequality  Redistribution and Growth 
The models of this section are diametrically opposed to the models of the previous section  In 
the previous argument  high inequality leads to greater amount of rent-seeking  exploitation 
or regressive taxation of the non-elite  which in turn stifles growth through bad allocation 
In contrast  the models of Alesina and Rodrik   and Persson and Tabellini   argue 
that high inequality sets up a clamor for redistributive taxation  That redistribution then 
ends up being bad for growth because distortionary taxes stifle investment and therefore 
growth 
These models are set up in a democratic context  and the median voter theorem is used in 
particular  The simplest way to see these models  here I follow Benabou   is to imagine  
that income is distributed lognormally   ln y   N m 
 
  Then it is trivial to see that the 
log of the median income is precisely m  and also  if   denotes mean income 
  m   ln    
 
 
 
 
Suppose that there are only two policies on the table  t      laissez faire  and t      with full 
lumpsum transfers to everyone  full redistribution  Everyone below the mean income will 
prefer full redistribution  so that the degree of support for full redistribution may be proxied 
by the value of the cfd evaluated at   Recalling   and using   for the cdf of a standard 
Notes on Inequality and Growth  
normal  we see that the degree of support for redistribution is proportional to 
p    
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
Of course this value is bigger than   but that isn t necessarily enough for full redistribution 
to be passed  After all  as Benabou argues  a large fraction of the individuals at the lower end  
may not vote at all  For instance  if the   poorest agents don t vote  then majority requires 
that we need a support of       counting from the bottom of those individuals that do 
vote  Adding back the   this shows that the identity of the modified median voter is given 
by   where          
However  what appears  seemingly to be  robust is the point that  P      That is  the 
greater is the amount of inequality in the system  the more widespread is the support for 
full redistribution 
What if one augments the model   as one needs to  to connect it with growth   by 
presuming that redistributions are costly  Continuing to follow Benabou  the simplest  
depiction of that cost is one in which every income y is reduced equiproportionately from 
y to ye B 
  where B     whenever redistribution takes place  Now the threshold income Y 
which will support full redistribution is no longer   but is given by 
lnY   ln     B   m  
 
 
 
 
  B 
 
 
using   Consequently  the new degree of support is now given by 
p    
 
 B    
 
 
 
   
 
 
B 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Of course  this reduces the level of support for redistribution  relative to the benchmark 
case  but what is more relevant is that the sensitivity of demand for redistribution to the 
underlying amount of inequality becomes even higher  To see this  observe that 
 P 
 
   
 
 
 
B 
 
 
 
 
    B 
 
 
 
 
 
and this exceeds the ealier sensitivity  which is just 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
on two counts  provided that Y   m 
 
  Inequality  Lack of Redistribution and Growth 
Notice that the model of the previous section relies on very different predictions regarding 
the effect of redistribution on growth  relative to the arguments that went before  The 
Alesina-Rodrik view is that redistribution occurs via distortionary taxation and is therefore 
necessarily growth-reducing  But our earlier models argue that redistribution is actually a 
 This will be the case anyway is at least a majority of the population is required to achieve redistribution 
  Notes on Inequality and Growth 
good thing  either because it prevents inefficient public allocation  or leads to lower rentseeking 
or permits individuals to find their true economic niche even if capital markets are 
imperfect 
This forms the basis of Benabou s argument  which is simply to entertain the opposite  
presumption that redistribution is beneficial to growth  Let s try out this idea on the very 
simple exercise presented above  Then instead of y being reduced by redistribution  let us 
suppose that it is raised to yeB 
  where B     Now the threshold income Y which will support 
full redistribution is given by 
lnY   ln     B   m  
 
 
 
 
  B 
 
 
oncea again invoking   Therefore  the degree of support is given by 
p    
 
B    
 
 
 
   
 
B 
 
 
 
 
 
 
But now this affects the demand for redistribution  or rather  the way it reacts to inequality 
To see this  note that 
 P 
 
   
 
 
B 
 
 
 
 
   
B 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Now notice that for small   the change in the support for redistribution  as inequality 
increases  is actually negative  The reason is not hard to see  By our assumed independence 
of B from   we see that for very small degrees of inequality practically everyone benefits 
from redistribution  So there is near-universal support for it  As soon as   climbs  some 
of this support goes away as people prefer to retain their own incomes with laissez faire 
rather than succumb to full redistribution and undergo an increase in income which will not 
compensate them for the original loss   For very high levels of inequality the relationship 
will again turn positive  because most people are now poor and the redistribution can only 
benefit them all 
The interesting thing about this model is that it yields the same inequality-growth tradeoff 
but for exactly the opposite set of reasons from the Alesina-Rodrik-Persson-Tabellini exercise 
In particular  assuming inequality is not too high  an increase in it actually lowers the demand 
for redistribution  but lower redistribution is presumed to be bad for growth  so that the 
same reduced-form relationship between inequality and growth is obtained 
  Inequality  Conflict and Growth 
This is a connection emphasized by Alesina and Perotti   Benhabib and Rustichini 
  Svensson   and others  According to this view  high inequality causes political 
instability  protests  violent demonstrations  coups  and rioting  These factors in turn make 
for low growth 
The literature on this issue is largely empirical  see  e g  Perotti   The conceptual 
distinctions between inequality and polarization drawn by Esteban and Ray    
have yet to be usefully applied to instability  though see the recent work of Montalvo and 
Reynal-Querol   on ethnic polarization and civil war 
Notes on Inequality and Growth  
  Inequality  Status and Growth 
Suppose that individuals accumulate in part because they derive utility from overtaking 
other individuals in the wealth distribution  Then very flat wealth distributions will imply 
low densities generally  so that the status effects of investment are likely to be relatively 
small at the margin  Conversely  if the distribution is very egalitarian  then small changes in 
investment will have large status effects  leading to a higher rate of growth 
This is only half the story  though  because the collective investment decisions made by 
everybody will determine the distribution of wealth  In a fully specified equilibrium  the 
distribution of wealth and the rate of growth would be jointly determined  the iintuitive 
argument thus suggests that there are multiple steady states  but across those states the rate 
of growth and the extent of inequality are negatively correlated 
Here is a very simple model that exhibits this effect  Suppose that individual utilities are 
given by 
A 
 y   x 
 
     
  F x    r 
where y is initial wealth  x is investment  so y   x is consumption  r is the rate of return to 
investment  and F  is the cdf of wealth in the  next generation 
We study steady states  so suppose that everybody s wealth grows at some common rate 
g  though with different level coefficients  Define  then  a cdf F on the normalized variable 
y t    g 
t 
  So we may rewrite individual utility above as 
A 
 y   x 
 
     
  F 
 
x    r 
    g 
 
 
where tomrrow s wealth is now in normalized form  For this to be a steady state  the above 
expression must be precisely maximized at x r      g y  or x     g y r  Writing 
down the first-order conditions and making this substitution  we see that 
Ay 
 
r   g 
    r 
 
 
    r 
    g 
F 
 
 y 
and this solves out for F over various supports and for various values of g  It is easy to see 
that the negative correlation between inequality and growth is borne out in this model 
  Positive Connections Between Inequality and Growth 
All the models above suggest that there should be a negative reduced-form relationship 
between inequality and growth  though the channels of interaction are very different 
Are there any reasons for believing that inequality might be growth-enhancing in some 
situations  There certainly are 
  Setup Costs and Extreme Poverty  Imagine a very poor society in which everyone 
has low income  too low to incur the setup cost of a potentially profitable business  Then 
that business activity will be thoroughly undersupplied  Instead  if wealth is distributed 
unequally  some of the the individuals will be able to start the business activity  which 
  Notes on Inequality and Growth 
may then have high-growth implications for society as a whole  To be sure  the additional 
inequality thus generated may be intolerable  but that is not the issue here  Inequality will 
be positively associated with growth 
  Uneven Technical Progress  Inequality and Growth  The sources of technical 
progress are inherently uneven  Some sector  such as software design  biotechnology  or 
financial services  takes off  and there is a frenetic increase in demand for individuals with 
these skills  The economy as a whole registers growth  of course  But this growth is highly 
concentrated in a relatively small number of sectors  Then  at least over the short to medium 
run  inequality will be positively associated with growth  Whether this effect persists in the 
longer run will depend on the frequency of such technological  shocks  and the speed at 
which subsequent intersectoral adjustments occur 
  The Tunnel Effect  The above argument is related somewhat to the  tunnel  effect 
described by Hirschman and Rothschild   You are driving through a two-lane tunnel 
where both lanes are in the same direction and  guess what  you get caught in a serious 
traffic jam  No car is moving in either lane as far as you can see  You are in the left lane and 
your spirits are not exactly high  After a while  however  the cars in the right lane begin to 
move  Do you feel better or worse  It depends on how long the right lane has been moving 
At least initially  you might feel that the jam has cleared further ahead and that your turn to 
move will come soon 
It has been the experience of several developing economies that the level of inequality in the 
distribution of income increases over the initial phases of development  The responses to 
such a rise in inequality have been varied  both across economies as well as within the same 
economy at different points in time  and they have ranged from an enthusiastic acceptance 
of the growth process that accompanied the rise in inequality to violent protests against it in 
the form of social and political upheaval  Such differences in the tolerance for inequality may 
be explained with the help of the tunnel analogy  The individual s response to an uneven 
improvement will depend on his beliefs as to what it implies for his own prospects  If he 
believes such a rise in others  fortunes is indicative of brighter prospects for himself in the 
foreseeable future  then he may make complementary investments  further enhancing the 
growth correlations described in the previous section 
Of course  if such an improvement in the welfare of others were to persist for a sustained 
period of time  without any improvement in one s own welfare  initial acceptance of the 
improved condition of others would soon give way to anger and frustration  as in the 
tunnel example  Moreover  increased inequality may not be tolerated at all if the perceived 
link between the growing fortunes of others and the individual s own welfare is weak or 
nonexistent  The greater the extent of segregation in society to begin with  the higher the 
possibility of this outcome 
  Inequality  Savings and Growth  A last positive connection between inequality and 
growth may arise from the effect of inequality on the ability to save  and subsequently on 
growth rates  the argument is based on a nonconvexity similar to the setup costs story of 
a previous subsection  but the nonconvexity this time arises from minimum consumption 
Notes on Inequality and Growth  
needs  This may cause the savings function to become convex  at least over some range  with 
the corollary that higher inequality  in this range of incomes  may be associated with greater 
savings rates  The higher savings rates would presumably translate into higher growth rates 
via standard argument 
  Symmetric HoldUps  Inequality and Growth  the last argument that I present 
here  due to Banerjee and Duflo   is different from all the others in that it argues 
for a nonmonotonic relationship between inequality and growth  This is analogous to 
the assertion of a Kuznets curve  though that curve is concerned with a nonmonotonic 
relationship between inequality and per-capita GDP 
Return to the Alesina-Rodrik view  discussed in an earlier section  This view may be 
thought of as a situation in which the poor essentially hold up the rich  demanding transfers 
in exchange for participating in the growth process where the benefits are flowing directly 
to the relatively rich  and so need to be transferred via redistribution  In the Alesina-Rodrik 
view  these transfers create distortionary incentives at the margin  thereby slowing down 
investment and growth 
Banerjee and Duflo attempt to argue that this sort of holdup may well be symmetric  Just 
as the poor may hold up the rich  the rich may hold up the poor  Excessive equality may 
create a situation in which the traditionally rich demand compensation for pro-poor growth 
thus degrading that growth via analogous distortionary effects   in just the same way as 
redistributive taxation did  This sort of argument suggests an inverse association between 
growth and changes in inequality in any direction  the compensating transfers  Banerjee and 
Duflo argue that such changes are more likely when inequality is either very high or very 
low  and passing to the reduced form  this might suggest an inverse-U relationship between 
inequality and growth  The warning  don t impose linear relationhips in the empirics 
  Empirical Results 
The arguments above all rely on different  structural assertions  inequality clearly works 
through a variety of channels on its way to a final impact on growth  An initial exercise 
then  is to simply address the reduced-form question  is inequality positively or negatively 
associated with growth  or perhaps more boldly  do initial inequalities retard or encourage 
subsequent growth 
What is a good proxy for  initial inequality  We would like to get a handle on inequalities 
in wealth or assets at the beginning of the time period  but data on these are notoriously hard 
to come by  One proxy for wealth is inequality of income at that time  but we must recognize 
that this is an imperfect proxy  Wealth inequalities at some date are  in a sense  the sum 
total of all income inequalities up to that date  and there is no reason why the last of these 
inequalities should adequately mirror the history of all its predecessors 
Another proxy for wealth inequality is the inequality in some  relatively  easy-to-observe 
asset  such as land  Data on land inequality are easier to obtain  although they are plagued 
with problems of their own  Of these problems  the most serious is the distortion created in 
countries that are subject to a land reform measure through the imposition of land ceilings 
  Notes on Inequality and Growth 
In such countries land belonging to a single individual or household may be held under a 
variety of names  thus creating the illusion of lower inequality than there actually is  Aside 
from this problem  land inequality can only be a good proxy for overall inequality in wealth 
if agriculture is either significantly important in the economy  for the beginning of the time 
period under consideration  or at the very least  has been of significant importance in the 
recent past  Fortunately for our purposes  this is a condition that is adequately satisfied by 
developing countries 
Alesina and Rodrik   regress per capita income growth over the period   on a 
variety of independent variables  such as initial per capita income and a measure of initial 
human capital   these are well-known controls  the initial income variable is a proxy for 
possible convergence effects  while the human capital variable is used as a proxy for the 
endogenous growth effects studies by Uzawa  Lucas and others  see  e g  Barro  
Indeed  as far as these variables are considered  Alesina and Rodrik use the same data as 
Barro  which makes for cleaner comparison with existing work  In addition  they included 
data on initial inequality of income and initial inequality of land 
Their results indicate a substantial negative relationship between initial inequality and 
subsequent growth  Particularly strong is the influence of the Gini coefficient that represents 
the initial inequality in land holdings  Their results suggested that an increase in the land 
Gini coefficient by   standard deviation  which is only an increase of   in this case  would 
decrease subsequent economic growth by as much as   percentage points per year   The 
Gini coefficient on initial income is only significant at the   level 
These results are unaltered once we allow for structural differences across democratic and 
nondemocratic political systems  What is more  the democracy dummy is insignificant both 
by itself and when interacted with the Gini coefficient on land  It does appear that political 
systems play little role in this relationship  so it is unclear whether a median-voter type 
argument is central here  more on that below 
The Alesina-Rodrik findings are confirmed with the use of a more comprehensive data set 
in Deininger and Squire   Initial land inequality is more significant than initial income 
inequality and stays that way even under several variations on the basic regression exercise 
 such as the use of regional dummies  The insignificance of the political system also holds 
up under the Deininger-Squire investigation 
The study by Persson and Tabellini   finds slightly different results with somewhat 
different specifications  They use the income share of the top quintile as their measure of 
inequality  They don t use land distributions  They carry out two kinds of regressions 
One is a set of historical regressions for nine now-developed countries for which the data 
stretches well back  The other is a cross-section study  where the independent variable is 
the share of the middle class  see also Perotti  
      to be completed 
 The income inequality data are taken from Jain   and Fields   The land distribution data are drawn 
from Taylor and Hudson  
 The countries are Austria  Denmark  Finland  Germany  the Netherlands  Norway  Sweden  the UK and the US 
CHAPTER  
Notes on Credit Markets 
  Introduction 
We now turn to a detailed study of credit markets  As explained in my text  most developing 
countries have a preponderance of informal credit markets  where the lenders are not formal 
financial institutions  We will take the following route 
  We begin with a simple study of interest rate variation  We show how   depending on 
the presence or absence of collateral   interest rates can be either high or low  Additional 
fuel for this sort of variability will also be found when we study interlinkage 
  We then turn to a study of quantity restrictions on credit  These may actually take 
two forms  credit rationing or loan pushing  The former involves the borrower wanting a 
larger loan than what he is given at the going rate of interest  The latter involves wanting a 
smaller loan  Finally  note that credit rationing can take the  micro form  that we have just 
described or can be of a more  macro variety  some people are entirely excluded from the 
credit market  We will discuss various sources of credit restrictions 
  We study the general equilibrium of credit markets  In the analysis so far  we take as 
given an outside option for borrowers  To be sure  this outside option will be endogenous in 
a larger context  We show that the presence of information regarding past dealings is crucial 
in determining these outside options  and indeed  that in some cases the credit market may 
entirely collapse 
  We study interlinkage and segmentation in credit markets  using largely rural examples 
The idea is to interlink contracts to get around limited collateral  or limited incentives  by 
offering a package  We will see that there may be several advantages to doing so  First 
some distortions can be avoided  Second  incentives  such as the threat of termination 
can be made to do double-duty  for  say  credit repayment as well as tenancy  Finally 
in the absence of monetizable collateral  such as unskilled labor or a small piece of land 
interlockers may have a serious edge over non-interlinking moneylenders 
  Notes on Credit Markets 
  Finally  we study group lending schemes such as those promoted by the Grameen Bank 
We show that under some conditions  group lending can be used as an effective tool ton 
transfer information from borrowers to lenders  thereby making some new contracts feasible 
 and profitable  for both lender and borrower 
  A Simple Example 
Imagine that loans are forthcoming at an interest rate of   and that there are alternative 
projects  each requiring a startup cost of   pesos  Suppose that the projects are arrayed 
in terms of their rate of return  and that there are two of them  with rates of return pegged 
at   and   If there is no uncertainty about the projects  and all projects pay off fully in 
the next time period  this is tantamount to saying that the projects will return gross revenues 
of   and   pesos respectively 
Observe that in this case there is a perfect coincidence of interests between the bank and the 
borrower  The bank wants its   back  and would presumably also want the borrower to 
take up the optimal project  Given that the borrower wants to make as much money as he 
can  there is no reason for him not take up the project with a   return  Everyone is happy 
But now let us change matters around a little bit  Suppose that the return to the second 
project is uncertain  Thus keep the second project just the same as before  but suppose that 
the first project pays off   pesos with probability   and nothing with probability 
  The expected return is just the same as it was before 
Now let us think about the rankings of these projects from the viewpoints of borrower and 
lender  To do this  we shall assume limited liability  if a project fails  the borrower cannot 
return any money to the lender  she simply declares bankruptcy  The bank would like to 
fund the   project  just as before  indeed  more than it did before  This is because the  
project pays off its interest  and principal  for sure  while this happens only with probability 
  in the case of the   project 
What about the borrower s expected return  Assuming that she is risk-neutral like the bank 
is 
it is                 for the safe project  and it is            
        for the risky project  Her expected return is much higher under a riskier 
project with a lower rate of return  She will therefore try to divert the loan to this project 
and this will make the bank very unhappy 
What went wrong with the market here  What is wrong is that the borrower has limited 
liability  In this example  she pays up if all goes well  but if the project fails  he does not 
repay anything  she does not get anything either but that is not the main point  In a sense 
this creates an artificial tendency for a borrower to take on too much risk  she benefits from 
the project if it goes well  but is cushioned on the downside  The bank would like to prevent 
this risk from being taken  Often it cannot 
We will come back to this scenario in more detail later  It will form the basis for theories of 
credit rationing 
 A similar example can also be constructed even if the borrower is risk-averse 
Notes on Credit Markets  
Observe that if the borrower could somehow be made to repay the loan under every 
contingency  we would be back to a world that s equivalent to one of perfect certainty 
The bank would not care what the borrower did with the money  and the borrower would 
choose the project with the highest expected rate of return  But who can repay in all  or 
most  contingencies  They are the relatively rich borrowers  who can dig into their pockets 
to repay even if the project goes badly  We see here  then  in particularly stark form  one 
important reason why banks discriminate against poor borrowers 
Thus institutional credit agencies often insist on collateral before advancing a loan  For a 
bank which is interested in making money  this is certainly a reasonable thing to do  For 
poor peasants  however  this usually makes formal credit an infeasible option  It is not that 
they lack collateral to put up  But the collateral is often of a very specific kind  A farmer may 
have a small quantity of land that he is willing to mortgage  But a bank may not find this 
acceptable collateral  simply because the costs of selling the land in the event of a default is 
too high for the bank  Likewise  a landless laborer may be seeking funds to cover a sudden 
illness in the family  and pledge his labor as collateral  he would work off the loan  But no 
bank will accept labor as collateral 
  Interest Rate Variations 
Classical explanation for a high rate of interest in informal credit markets rests on the 
lender s risk hypothesis  Bottomley   because there is risk  as in the previous section 
and because lending costs need to be covered  the lender tacks on a premium over and above 
the opportunity cost of lending  This is a fairly obvious point but it should also be noted that 
the point is often wrong  The reason is that the interest rate premium will also systematically 
affect borrower behavior  There may be effects working through adverse selection  moral 
hazard  or the strategic repayment incentive  In the next section  we begin our study of these 
effects with the model of Stiglitz and Weiss  
  Quantity Restrictions 
  Quantity Restrictions Based on Adverse Selection  We base this on Stiglitz and 
Weiss   Assume away the strategic default problem  But there is involuntary default 
coupled with limited liability  To model this  assume that borrowers differ in some parameter 
  measuring riskiness  Project returns R are given by a cdf F R    and it is assumed that 
higher values of   generate the same means but higher risk  That is  if      
  then 
  Z  
 
RdF R     
Z  
 
RdF R   
 
while 
  Z y 
 
F R   dR  
Z y 
 
F R   
 dR 
for all y with strict inequality holding for some y 
  Notes on Credit Markets 
Assume that individuals know their own type  while the bank only knows the distribution 
of types and cannot recognize the individual riskiness of persons 
The project has a startup cost of B  There is limited liability  each individual has access 
to only some fixed collateral C  Now study the repayment decision  If the rate of interest 
charged is r  then an individual repays if and only if 
  R       r B    C 
where we are assuming that the bank can seize both the total return R as well as the collateral 
It follows that the borrower s return  when the realized return is R and the rate of interest is 
r  is given by 
   R r    max R       r B C 
which is convex in R  while the lender s return is 
   R r    min R   C  B    r 
which is concave in R 
This permits us to display the expected payoff to a borrower of type   it is 
   r   
Z  
 
 R r dF R   
while the expected payoff to the lender  when facing a borrower of type   is 
   r   
Z  
 
 R r dF R   
Now here is the important point  To be sure  the expected payoff to a lender    r    is 
surely decreasing in   which is immediately intuitive  But a bit more subtle than this is the 
observation that the expected payoff to a borrower    r    is actually increasing in his 
own riskiness  
To put this another way  define  for each r the threshold  r  given by 
   r r     
Then the set of types applying for a loan at the rate of interest r is precisely          r 
and  r  is increasing in r  So increasing r lowers the average quality of loan applicants  It follows 
that bank profits will   in general   be nonmonotonic with respect to r 
We may build on these concepts to define   relatively informally   a notion of competitive 
equilibrium  To do this  let G stand for the distribution of types  First  define the profit rate 
at r by 
  d r   
 
B    G r  Z  
 r 
 r dG 
 
 
where  r    which is expected profits when the borrower is of type     is defined in 
  and  r    the marginal borrower when the interest rate is equal to r   is defined by

Figure   Credit Rationing  Three Cases 
With free entry and exit of banks  the profit rate r will actually turn out to be the deposit rate 
that is paid to depositors  which is why we are using the d-notation 
Now for each deposit rate d  there is a supply of deposits S d  from potential depositors  Let 
us assume that S d  is an upward-sloping function  However  the supply of deposits viewed as 
a function of r will typically be nonmonotonic simply because d is generally a nonmonotonic 
function of r  Define S r    S d r  then this is the effective supply of deposits as a function 
of the interest rate charged to borrowers  with the zero-profit condition already built in 
Finally  there is a demand curve for loans D r  which has the usual downward-sloping 
shape  Indeed  in our specific model  everyone who borrows borrows the same amount B 
while the cutoff  r  gets progressively higher with r  That means that the aggregate demand 
has the appropriate shape in r 
Define a competitive equilibrium to be a compact set of interest rates charged by banks such 
that no bank wants to deviate from those interest rates given optimal borrower behavior 
  Notes on Credit Markets 
Proposition   Credit Rationing   a  Suppose that there is an interest rate r with S r    D r 
such that S r 
 
    S r  for all r    r  Then there is no equilibrium with credit rationing 
 b  Suppose that for every interest rate r such that D r    S r  there exists r    r with S r 
 
    S r 
Then there is credit rationing in equilibrium 
Figure   illustrates  In panel A  there is no crossing of the two curves and so condition 
 b  of the proposition holds trivially  In panel B  there is a crossing of the two curves but 
condition  b  is satisfied nevertheless  In panel C  condition  a  holds  Thus in cases A and 
B  there is credit rationing and in case C there is not 
It is easy to see how the proposition is proved  First assume case  a  Suppose  on the 
contrary  that there is an equilibrium with credit rationing  Let r 
  be the lowest equilibrium 
rate  certainly credit is rationed there  Observe that all r 
 
in the equilibrium set of interest 
rates   call it E   must be equally attractive to depositors  so that 
d r 
 
    d r 
 
    d 
 
for all r 
    E 
and that the total supply of deposits divided across all lending banks must be S r 
 
 
Fix r as given by condition  a 
First suppose that r 
    r  Then we have S r 
 
    D r 
 
    D r    S r  so we conclude that 
S r    S r 
 
  and consequently that d r    d r 
 
  But now this equilibrium can be broken by 
having a bank deviate to r from r 
 
  Because d r    d r 
 
  it can offer some d 
    d r 
 
  and less 
than d r  and so make strictly positive profits  All the borrowers will come to him and all 
the depositors as well  This contradicts the assumption that we are at an equilibrium 
Therefore r 
    r  But then by  a  we know that S r    S r 
 
  so d r    d 
 
  the equilibrium 
deposit rate  Now consider a deviation by a bank to charging an interest rate r and a deposit 
rate d    d 
 
  d r  All the depositors will come to this bank  so the supply of funds is not a 
problem  To see if borrowers will be available  proceed as follows 
The total supply of loans to all banks is S r 
 
   depositors get the same rate in all banks 
and simply divide themselves up  In particular  add up  or integrate  all depositor funds 
available in equilibrium at interest rates r or less  this is not any more than S r 
 
  On the 
other hand  the total demand for loans just by risk types above  r  is D r    S r    S r 
 
 
Thus demand  by these types alone  strictly exceeds total supply at interest rates r or less 
Indeed  because banks that ration credit randomly reject applicants  we see that conditional 
on      r  the distribution of risk types by borrowers is no different from G  These 
borrowers will come to our deviating bank  and the bank can make positive profit from 
them  We therefore have a contradiction  and the proof of part  a  is complete 
Now assume that the condition in  b  is true  If the conclusion is false  there is an equilibrium 
with interest rate r  such that S r    D r  We know that S r 
 
    S r  for some r 
    r  Because 
S r 
 
    S r  we know that d r 
 
    d r  Therefore a bank can deviate by offering r 
  and some 
d 
    d r  and less than d r 
 
  and still make profits  All the borrowers will come to him and 
all the depositors as well  This contradicts the assumption that we are at an equilibrium 
Notes on Credit Markets  
It still remains to prove that an equilibrium exists with credit rationing in the case where  b 
holds  To this end  define r  as the maximizer of d r   there could be many but let s assume 
for ease of exposition that there is only one  Let r  denote the lowest Walrasian outcome 
 set it equal to infinity if there is no such outcome  If r  is smaller than r  it is easy to check 
that all banks announcing r  is an equilibrium  and that it involves credit rationing 
The case r    r  is not consistent with case  b  so it remains to look at the case in which 
r    r  By condition  b  there is some conditional maximizer r 
    r  of d r   subject to 
the constraint that r   r  Now define r  to be the smallest value of r   r  such that 
d r    d r 
 
   such an r  must exist because r 
 
is a local but not a global maximizer  Because 
S r    S r 
 
    S r    D r    D r  there must be excess supply at r  Now figure out a 
division of banks among the two rates of interest so that all demand is soaked up  It is easy 
to check that this forms an equilibrium  Notice that in this equilibrium there must be credit 
rationing because there is a multiplicity of interest rates 
Some Observations 
  The absence of collateral  is  of course  critical to this sort of reasoning  But even if there 
is some collateral  not necessarily enough to cover the entire risk of default  the collateral 
can be used in a clever way to achieve some screening  Thus think now of a contract as a 
pair  r C  where r is the rate of interest and C is the collateral that has to be put up in order 
to obtain loans at that rate of interest  Then the return to a borrower of type   is 
 r C   
Z  
 
max R       r B C dF R   
   CF     r B   C     
Z  
 r B C 
 R       r B dF R   
Using this expression  look at the tradeoff between r and C that leaves a borrower of type  
on the same indifference curve  This is just 
dr 
dC     
    C 
    r 
 
F     r B   C   
 B     F     r B   C   
 
Look at the case in which  r B C is a  low  return  e g  assume that  r B C is smaller 
than the average value of R and that all distributions are symmetric  In this case  dr 
dC 
goes up as   goes up  That is  low-risk types are less willing to accept a given interest rate 
increase for a given collateral reduction  This is because they fear less the loss of collateral 
and expect to pay interest in more states of nature 
It follows that if banks are offering  r C  pairs  separation will be possible  This is the criticism 
levied by Bester  AER  
  Credit rationing is not inevitable in this model  For instance  if the supply of loanable 
funds inccreases  credit rationing disappears  Alternatively  if projects were divisible and 
there were constant returns to scale then we would get equal treatment  all applicants would 
get a loan  though not as much as they would like   back to micro credit rationing 
  Notes on Credit Markets 
  Notice that mean and riskiness are uncorrelated in this model  If the correlation is 
positivem then the adverse selection effect would be weaker  Thus this form of credit 
rationing relies on specific distributional assumptions 
  This form of credit rationing may also not be empirically very plausible if there are 
several observationally distinguishable groups  along riskiness lines  Then at most one 
group would be rationed  Riley  AER  
  Quantity Restrictions Based on Moral Hazard 
  Moral Hazard in Project Choice Let s begin with a variant of the Stiglitz-Weiss 
model in which there is unobserved project choice  and therefore moral hazard  on the part 
of the borrower  Say that there are borrowers with various levels of  observable and seizable 
collateral C  There is also a whole range of projects indexed by   as before  but this time no 
particular   is attached to any borrower  they all choose from this set of projects 
Assume that project returns are binary for every   Specifically  suppose that the return is  
with probability p  and is   with probability     p  The gross expected value of project 
  is  then   p  We suppose without loss of generality that p  falls with   if this did not 
happen over some range  those projects would be never be chosen anyway 
Assume  just as before  that each project requires the same loan size of B 
Now a borrower who puts down collateral C and faces a rate of interest r will choose   to 
maximize 
p      B    r   
 
    p 
 
C 
where I assuming that the best   exceeds B r  otherwise the borrower would not borrow 
at all 
This determines  C r  as a function of C and r  assume that the maximized value is unique 
 it is easy to give suficient conditions for this to happen 
Observe that  C r  is decreasing in C and increasing in r  more collateral induces safety  higher 
interest rates induce risk 
To prove this  define Z   B    r    C  and convince yourself that the borrower maximizes 
p    Z 
by choosing   Let Z    Z  and   and   be the corresponding maxima  Then by the 
assumed uniqueness of the maximum 
p    Z    p    Z 
while 
p    Z    p    Z 
Adding these two inequalities  we can conclude that 
 
p    p 
 
 Z    Z     
Because p  is declining  we can conclude that   is increasing in Z  which completes the 
proof 
Notes on Credit Markets  
Now look at a person with C     Notice that as long as 
max 
r 
p r    r        r 
where r  is the opportunity rate of return to funds  such people will be completely rationed 
out  and all collaterals that are small enough will  by continuity  be completely rationed out 
as well  There is no rate of interest at which a loan will be forthcoming to them 
So moral hazard also generally leads to credit rationing  Under some conditions  it is also 
possible to predict what happens to the interest rate for different sizes of collateral  For 
instance  under competitive lending  it must be the case that 
p C r B    r        p C r C   B    r 
raiseC  then by our previous result   comes down so that p  goes up  Obviously  B r    C 
so in summary  the left hand side of the equality above must go up  To restore equality  the 
interest rate r must fall  Therefore under competition the interest rate on loans moves 
inversely with collateral 
With monopolistic lending  matters are not so clear  which makes sense  A monopolistic 
lender may well take advantage of a highly collateralized  and therefore safe  borrower to 
push up the interest rate  I leave it to you to examine whether r must rise with C over some 
stretch of collaterals 
  Moral Hazard in Effort A debt overhang refers to a state of affairs in which an 
ongoing debt reduces the effort taken by the borrower to ensure a good output  This is the 
moral hazard problem  It is unclear whether one thinks of this as an instance of strategic or 
involuntary default   both elements are present 
In simplest terms  think of a consumption smoothing model  Let wealth be w  today  while 
today it has value w  with probability p and   otherwise  Assume that w    w  If L 
is borrowed today and then R repaid tomorrow  only in the good state  of course  then 
expected utility is given by 
  u w    L     pu w    R 
where we have normalized u  to  
The lender gets an expected value of 
   L    pR 
where this formulation presumes that the risk-free rate of interest is given by         r 
Now imagine that p is exogenous and that we are trying to find a Pareto-optimal allocation 
That is  maximize   while respecting some lower bound on the value in   It is 
easy to see that we must set 
  w    R   w    L 
so that there is perfect consumption smoothing  over those states that permit it  The exact 
values of R and L cannot be pinned down until we know the particular Pareto-optimal point 
  Notes on Credit Markets 
that we are trying to characterize  For instance  if lenders operate in a competitive market 
with free entry  then lender s profits will be driven to zero  so that  by  
  R  
 
 p 
L 
which is just another way of saying that the rate of interest is driven down to the risk-adjusted 
value  
 p 
   
In this case  equations   and   fully pin down the first best credit scheme 
Now suppose that the probability of success can be influenced by the deliberate application 
of effort  To keep things very simple  we shall suppose that there just two possible levels 
of effort    and   The corresponding probabilities of success are p  and p  respectively 
where p    p  The cost of setting effort equal to zero is   while the cost of setting effort 
equal to   is D 
Thus  ex post  imagine that there is an overhang of R and the borrower is deciding on effort 
input  He will choose the high level of effort if 
 p    p u w    R    D 
or equivalently  if 
  R   R    w    h 
 
D 
p    p   
 
where h is just the inverse function of u 
Now if R  is higher than the first-best equilibrium  there is no problem  The first-best outcome 
still obtains 
On the other hand  there may be credit rationing especially if wealth is low or if D is high 
In that case  one needs to compare the rationed contract with another possibility in which 
e     and loans are advanced at the higher competitive rate  
 p      We would then expect 
that no credit rationing would occur both among the very poor and the very wealthy  while 
credit rationing would be observed for borrowers with intermediate levels of wealth 
We can easily extend these to cohesive notions of equilibrium  with free entry on the part of 
lenders  Notice that such equilibria would be second-best Pareto optimal  the government 
cannot do better if it must also repect the moral hazard constraint of the borrower 
However  this assumes that lenders can offer exclusive contracts  If exclusivity cannot be 
enforced  then these equilibria will break down 
To see this  notice that at the credit-rationed equilibrium  a borrower is under rationed even 
relative to the higher interest rate  
 p    The way to see this is to note that the loan repayment 
amount with perfect insurance under the higher interest rate must exceed its counterpart 
under the lower interest rate  Because this counterpart  in turn  exceeds the threshold R    it 
follows that the credit-rationed borrower would love to take some additional loan  small 
enough  under the higher interest rate  
 p       or even at a rate a little higher than that 
Notes on Credit Markets  
If a lender supplies this loan   which he will if exclusivity cannot be monitored   then 
this creates a negative externality on the  incumbent lender  and second-best optimality  at 
least relative to an ideal in which the government can enforce exclusivity  will break down 
  Quantity Restrictions Based on the Default Problem  Consider the following 
model of working capital  Output simply depends on the amount of loan  L  taken via 
the function F L  satisfying standard properties  A borrower is engaged in a repeated 
relationship with a lender  but if he leaves the relationship he has an outside option given 
by a normalized value of v 
Consider only stationary contracts  L R  for the moment  later  we explore the nonstationary 
case  Then what is the incentive constraint for the borrower  It is given by the restriction 
     F L     v   F L    R 
or  rearranging 
   F L    R    v 
Now suppose that given these outside options  the lender has all the bargaining power 
Suppose  more over  that the opportunity interest rate of funds lent out is r  Then he 
maximizes his payoff 
R       r L 
by choice of  L R  and subject to the incentive constraint  
It is easy to see  either by constructing the Lagrangean and differentiating  or drawing a 
diagram  that the solution involves the granting of a loan of size L  where this solves the 
equation 
   F 
 
 L        r 
and then asking for a repayment R  satisfying 
   F L    R     v 
Now let us ask ourselves  is there credit rationing or loan pushing at this solution  Notice 
to begin with  that L  is surely less than L 
 
  which solves F 
 
 L 
 
        r and which would 
surely have been the optimal amount barring default considerations  So there is clearly a 
restruiction of the loan relative to this value  But this does not say anything a priori about 
whether there is credit rationing or loan pushing  To settle this we will have to look at the 
implict rate of interest on the loan  which is r   
R 
L     
The question is  would the borrower have preferred to borrow more or borrow less at this 
rate of interest r 
The answer to this question depends on the discount factor of the borrower  First note that 
a solution to the maximization problem exists if and only if 
  max 
L 
 F L   
    r 
 
L    v 
Suppose that we are at  or very close to  the existence borderline  In that case 
R        r L 
  Notes on Credit Markets 
which is just another way of saying that 
r    r 
At the same time  L    L 
 
  So obviously for low discount factors we have credit rationing 
 relative to the implicit or explict rate of interest on the loan 
On the other hand  suppose that   holds for some threshold value of   but that   in 
any case     is very close to one  Then the structure of the optimal contract   see    
tells us that 
L    L 
 
 
while 
R        r L 
 To understand this last inequality  recall from the optimality condition   that R   
 F L     v       r L  where the strict inequality holds because   must hold strictly 
when   is close enough to one 
In other words  for   sufficiently close to unity there must be loan pushing 
It turns out that loan pushing is a property of situations in which the creditor has some 
bargaining power and the borrower is sufficiently patient  For if we give the borrower all 
the bargaining power in this model  then loan pushing can never occur  To see this  consider 
the borrower s problem when he has all the bargaining power  lender profits must be zero 
so the borrower maximizes 
  F L        r L 
subject to his own incentive constraint   which we may rewrite here as 
   F L        r L    v 
Again  consider two cases  First  suppose that 
   F L 
 
        r L 
     v 
In this case the borrower must choose the unrestricted maximum L 
 
  Then there are no 
quantity restrictions  Otherwise 
   F L 
 
        r L 
     v 
But of course  it is still possible that   holds  On this assumption  the borrower will 
choose the loan size L  which is the maximum loan size L such that   holds  In this 
case there will be credit rationing 
  Information and Equilibrium in Credit Markets 
The main point of this section is to argue  along with Ghosh and Ray     that an 
informational breakdown in informal credit markets is likely in the process of development 
and that this has implications for the structure of contracts  we well as for the very existence 
of such markets 
Consider v  the outside option  Where does it come from  Presumably  this is the expected 
 present-value  payoff conditional on the termination of an ongoing bilateral relationship 
Notes on Credit Markets  
The reason for this termination will typically matter  For instance  if a borrower has defaulted 
and this is the cause of termination  then if this matter becomes known to new lenders they 
may not be willing to advance a loan 
Thus  v is some combination of punishment as well as the going equilibrium contract  There 
are obviously many ways to model this  Let us take a particularly simple version  where 
we assume that the lending market is competitive and borrowers have all the bargaining 
power  To review the usual stuff  recall that given the outside option v and the opportunity 
rate of interest r facing lenders  borrrowers maximize 
  F L        r L 
subject to the incentive constraint 
  F L   
    r 
 
L   v 
where   it will be recalled  is the discount factor 
It is obvious  then  that in any solution L to the above problem  L must be at least as large as 
the value L  that maximizes the LHS of the incentive constraint  
Let the optimum value of   be given by w  we emphasize that w depends on v 
Now let us try to endogenize v  Suppose that when a borrower defaults  he approaches a 
lender every period thereafter  The lender checks on the borrower s past and uncovers the 
default with probability p  In that case  the lender refuses the loan  and the borrower moves 
to the next period where exactly the same story repeats itself  If  on the other hand  the 
lender fails to uncover the default  the borrower enters into a new credit relationship with 
the lender  But in that case  the present value of the contract is w 
It follows that v   the expected value of the outside option   is given by 
  v   p v       p w  
    p 
     p 
w 
Then we can write v        w  where 
     
p     
     p 
can be viewed as the scarring factor  Notice that if p gets very close to one  so that a default 
is always recognized  then the scarring factor converges to one as well  On the other hand 
for any p strictly between zero and one  the scarring factor goes to zero as   goes to unity 
Proposition   Define 
   
   
    r     L   
F L        r L 
 
 Why new lenders may be unwilling to give a loan to past defaulters is actually a matter requiring some serious 
study  For instance  can one sustain this sort of outcome without any incomplete information at all on the part 
of the borrower  If there are a lot of borrowers and a lender can always find a fresh borrower  then this sort 
of assumption is relatively easy to maintain  Otherwise the equilibrium supporting this sort of penalty may be 
surprisingly convoluted   in the presence of complete information  at least 
  Notes on Credit Markets 
where L is the maximizer of F    L

L 
Then a competitive equilibrium exists if and only if      
 
 
Thus a certain minimum degree of scarring is needed before a competitive equilibrium can 
be guaranteed  This is intuitive  If scarring did not exist  individuals could always renege 
on loans and dive back into an anonymous pool 
Notice by the way that

a contradiction to the incentive constraint  
Sufficiency  Conversely  assume that      
 
  Define w    F L        r L 
For each w   w  define v        w  First  consider v         w  Notice that for v   v  the 
maximization problem described by   and   has a feasible solution  For

Now  for each w   w  form the corresponding v  as we just did for w  and keep noting the 
borrower s maximal w relative to that v  Call this mapping h w  Notice that there exists 
w    w  such that when we put v         w 
F L   
    r 
 
L    v 
Put another way  L  is the only solution satisfying the incentive constraint when the outside 
option is v  That means the borrower s maximum w   h w  at this point is simply w  So we 
Notes on Credit Markets  
have found two points w  and w  such that w    w  and 
h w    w  and h w    w    w 
Noticing that h is continuous is between  we have proved existence 
Thus is the scarring rate is too low  equilibrium falls apart  What might restore equilibrium 
and still permit credit markets to function 
  Credit Macro-Rationing  The first possibility is credit rationing at some macroeconomic 
level  To see how this fits  suppose that a past defaulter may be excluded from future 
loan dealings for two distinct reasons 
Targeted Exclusion  The defaulter s nasty behavior is unveiled bya new lender  which 
happens with probability p  and he is refused a loan  This is already present in the model 
above and we add nothing here 
Anonymous Exclusion  Whether or not a potential borrower has actually defaulted in the 
past  he may face difficulty in getting a loan  This is macro-rationing of credit  analogous 
to the equilibrium unempoloyment rate in Shapiro and Stiglitz   Let us denote the 
probability of such exclusion  in any period  by q  Notice that to build a coherent model in 
which q     we really have to answer the question of why the market is not clearing   why 
lenders do not pounce upon available borrowers and ply them with loans   Note  by the 
way  that the same issues come up when we attempt to explain p     without taking recourse 
to any reputational factors  One coherent model is given by the case in which lenders make 
zero expected profits  so that they are always indifferent between lending and not lending 
The main point is that anonymous exclusion may be an equilibrium-restoring device  To 
see this  let us calculate   the effective scarring factor  when there is both targeted and 
anonymous exclusion  The corresponding equation is 
     
     
     
where   now  is the overall probability of being excluded at any date  It is easy to see that 
              p    q 
Now notice that irrespective of the value of p  q can always adjust to guarantee that an 
equilibrium exists   To be sure  the determination of q becomes an interesting question  but 
this is beyond the scope of the present exercise

CHAPTER  
Interlinked Contracts 
We return to the question of borrower-lender matching  The data reveal that borrowers and 
lenders are ususally engaged in  compatible  occupations  the landlord lends to his tenant 
the trader lends to farmers who supply to him  and so on  Moreover  one observes that the 
contacts are ofen interlinked with other contracts  A loan is often offered as part of a tenancy 
arrangement  A trader may advance loans to the farmers who supply to him  What explains 
these interlinked contracts 
  Interlinkage as Assurance  Suppose that the lender s principal occupation involves 
increasing returns to scale  Trading is the best example  because the trader must incur large 
fixed costs to transport the produce  Faced with uncertainty regarding the quantity of output 
he can transport to the market during harvest time  he might find it in his interest to  tie up 
some farmers by giving them loans in exchange for the promise of output sales to him 
  Interlinkage as Enforcement  Interlinked relationships are sometimes useful for 
preventing strategic default as well  To see this  it will be useful to recall two stories with very 
similar features  First  think about the model of strategic default that we considered earlier 
We noticed that to prevent default  the moneylender cannot drive down the borrower to his 
participation constraint  To avoid default  a certain surplus over the next best option had to 
be provided  The borrower will trades off the loss in this surplus in future dates with the 
one-time gain to be had from default 
Second  notice that a very similar story can be constructed for a tenancy contract  and we 
will do that in the last section of this course  A tenancy contract can be supplemented 
by intertemporal incentives which promise to renew the contract in the case of satisfactory 
performance  and end it otherwise  This firing threat can only be a threat  however  if the 
tenant earns by being fired than he does with his current  and long-term  landlord  Thus 
the permanent contract must be in the nature of a carrot  which can be used as a stick in the 
event of noncompliance with the contract 
The simple observation is that with an interlinked relationship  a single carrot can be used as 
two sticks  as long as deviations cannot be carried outsimultaneously on both fronts  Combine 
the two scenarios  For instance  suppose that a landlord has a tenant to whom he offers a 
rental contract with threat of eviction in case the output is lower than some pre-understood 
  Interlinked Contracts 
minimum  Such a contract must  for the same reasons considered in the stories above  carry 
with it a certain surplus  Now it is easy to see that a loan to the tenant can be supported by an 
 interlinked threat  if the loan is not repaid  then the tenancy will be removed  The surplus 
in the tenancy thus serves a twin role  It assures the provision of appropriate effort in the 
tenancy contract  while at the same time it doubles as an incentive to repay loans  In this 
sense  the landlord is at a distinct advantage in advancing credit to his tenant  because he 
has at his disposal a pre-existing instrument of repayment  In contrast  a pure moneylender 
lending to the same tenant must offer additional incentives for repayment through the credit 
contract itself 
  Interlinkage and Nonmarketable Collateral  We ve already talked about the possible 
nonmarketability of collateral such as labor or even land  This might create what looks 
like interlinked contracts  because it will be very natural that someone who has use for the 
borrower s collateral will be lending to him  But one should be careful to note that this   in 
itself   does not guarantee that the contract itself will be interlinked  But it does go some 
way towards explaining market segmentation 
 Interlinkages and Distortions  The example that follows is based on Gangopadhyay 
and Sengupta  OEP   
Suppose that a crop is grown with market price p  Farmers can produce the crop on their 
own and market it through a trader  but with working capital they can produce an even 
larger amount  One way to describe this is to assume that the famer has access to an indirect 
production function F L  defined on the amount borrowed  which is L  Think of F  as the 
total output produced in the absence of working capital  assume that there are no other costs 
of production  and define A   pF  This is his outside option 
Now suppose that a trader has access to funds at some opportunity rate of interest i  and 
can lend it to the farmer  In principle he can offer a contract of the form  q r  where q is the 
price at which he can pledge to buy output from the farmer and r is the rate of interest at 
which he offers the loan 
If the trader offers a simple contract in which only some rate of interest r is specified  then 
the farmer will choose L to maximize 
F L        r L 
yielding some return to the farmer   call it B  Note that B   A if  for instance  F 
 
        r 
It will also yield a return C to the trader  where 
C    r   i L r 
 L r  being the optimal loan taken by the farmer at the rate of interest r 
To compare the surplus generated   which is B C   with the maximal total surplus that can 
be generated  introduce a fictional business in which the trader and the farmer are actually 
the same entity  Then this joint entity will choose L 
 
to maximize 
F L        i L 
Interlinked Contracts  
Let S be the maximal value  This is the total surplus available in the system  It is easy to see 
that for any r   i  S   B   C  This is the distortion  the loan size L r  is distorted away from 
L 
    L i 
However  there is an interlinked contract which regains full efficiency  and the trader will 
have the incentive to offer it  Define  q 
 
 r 
 
  such that 
  q 
 
 p       r 
 
    i 
and such that 
  max 
L 
q 
 F L        r 
 
 L   A 
It is easy to see that there is a unique contract satisfying these two properties  It must involve 
q 
    p and r 
    i  That is  the loan is advanced at a rate below the opportunity cost of funds 
for the trader  while the surplus from the loan is removed in the form of a lower output 
price 
This contract must maximize trader profits  By   the farmer will choose a loan size 
exactly equal to L 
 
  so this is the undistorted amount  By   the farmer is given just 
enough so that he will participate in the contract  So the trader will remove S   A  which is 
the highest that he can possibly get 
It is in this sense that interlinkage can remove distortions 
While this sort of argument has insight  it needs to be refined  For instance  there are other 
noninterlinked contracts that are also efficient in this case  But these must be nonlinear 
contracts  For instance  consider the forcing contract under which the trader says 
Either borrow L 
  at a high rate of interest R such that pF L 
 
        R L 
    A  or don t borrow 
anything at all 
This will also implement the first best  In other words  the interlinkage result may not be 
robust to nonlinear contracts 
  The interlocker s Edge  Of course  notice that this sort of forcing contract only makes 
sense when there is no asymmetric information  The lender has to be able to calcuate the 
first-best loan  However  as Ray and Sengupta   argue  there are several situations in 
which an interlocker has really no intrinsic advantage over a pure moneylender  To see this 
look at the following cases 
Case   The pure moneylender cannot offer arbitrary nonlinear contracts  In this case  as we 
have seen in the discussion above  the interlocker has an advantage 
Case   The interlocker faces better terms in the market where he is active  In this case he 
can do better than the pure moneylender  and this pure gain may be transformed into much 
larger profits if there are epsilon costs of entry 
Consider the following example  Suppose that a laborer needs a loan to tide over the slack 
season  In the peak season he may be employed with probability p or unemployed with 
probability     p  The moneylender cannot do anything about the laborer s probability of 
  Interlinked Contracts 
employment but a large landowner who will hire labor in the peak season certainly can 
This gives him the edge 
Case   Differential observability  Suppose a loan is given in the first period  In the second 
period  there is a standard principal-agent problem  the output is produced and the loan 
repaid  A fixed interest contract is not optimal then for the same reason that a fixed rent 
contract is not generally optimal  Lender can do better if he can observe output and condition 
repayments on these observations 
Case   Extend the trader-lender model so that the final output price is uncertain  If 
the lender is risk-neutral and the tenant is risk-averse  then the trader can provide perfect 
insurance by buying the crop at a fixed price  There is no need  for the trader  to observe the 
final price of the output  But if the moneylender cannot observe this final output  he cannot 
offer an equivalent contract 
Proposition   If Cases   do not hold  then interlinking and pure moneylending yield the same 
returns 
Proof  See Ray and Sengupta  
CHAPTER  
Credit Policy 
  Group Lending 
Begin with an adverse selection model along the lines considered by Stiglitz and Weiss  but 
in even more simplified form  we base this on Ghatak   There are a continuum of 
borrowers each seeking a unit loan  The repayment on the loan  principal plus interest  is 
denoted by r  The opportunity cost of making the loan is denoted by i 
We consider only two possible outcomes  full repayment and no repayment  Borrowers are 
indexed by their probabilities of repayment  which we denote by p  and the amount that 
they repay conditional on success  which we denote by R  Without loss of generality we let 
p index borrower type and we assume that pR p  is a constant  R  for each type of borrower 
Borrowers are distributed with support on the interval  q    where q     and with density 
g on this support 
Each borrower has an outside option of u  and everybody is assumed to be risk-neutral 
If we assume that 
  R   i   u 
then it is first-best optimal to lend to all borrowers  But let us see how the equilibrium 
works out  Assume that there is a competitive market among lenders  so that we impose 
the zero-profit condition on them 
Suppose that the going rate of repayment is r  Then who will borrow  Only those types p 
such that p   p r  where p r  is given by the equation 
R   p r r   u 
or 
  p r   
R   u 
r 
 
That is  the borrower pool will lie in the interval  q  p r  It follows that the zero-profit

Proposition   If   holds  then there is r such that a r r   i     Moreover  there is a unique 
equilibrium  generically  given by the smallest of the solutions  in r  to this zero-profit equation 
Proof  Begin by looking at r   i  In that case  we see that even the type p     will benefit by 
taking a loan because of   It follows that p i      But nevertheless  given that there is 
a spread of borrowers  a i      Therefore 
  a i i   i    
Now take r to the largest possible value which is consistent with the worst type borrower 
borrowing  call this value   Then 
lim inf 
r 
ra r    rlim inf 
r 
R p r 
q 
sg s ds 
G p r   
Notice that both numerator and denominator of this expression go to zero as r     So  using 
L Hospital s Rule  we may conclude  taking derivatives in both numerator and denominator 
above  that 
lim inf

g p 
   q   R   u   i 
using   again  Consequently 
  lim inf 
r 
a r r   i    
Noting that a r r is continuous  we can conclude from   and   that there exists 
r    i    such that a r r   i     Notice that there is a compact set of such solutions  so that a 
minimum   call it r 
    is well-defined 
Notice that an equilibrium must belong to the set of zero-solutions  To see this  observe that 
generically there exists an interval of the form  r 
 
 R 
  such that a r r i     in this interval 
Any bank can cut any other announcement to this value  get all the first pick at borrowers 
and make positive profits  So the equilibrium must involve a common announcement of r 
 
 
Now we turn to the possibility of group lending  To begin with  simply look at lending 
to groups of two  without worrying about whether this can be an equilibrium or not  A 
contract is now a pair  r  c  such that r is the payment a borrower makes if he is successful 
 Why is this generic  To see this  observe that the first zero of the function a r r   i must be a cut from  below 
because a i i   i     generically  it must be a cut in which case the condition in the main text is satisfied  There 
is a nongeneric possibility that the first zero is a point of tangency between the a r r   i line and the horizontal 
axis 
Credit Policy  
and c is an extra payment that he makes if he is successful but his partner is not  So the 
expected return to a type p when he is paired with a type p 
 
is 
   p  p 
 
    pp 
 R p    r    p    p 
 
 R p    r   c     R   rp    p    p 
 
 c 
Of course   p  p 
 
      everybody wants a safer partner  But the important point is that 
 p  p 
 
      as well  the safer person benefits more from a safer partner 
 p  p 
 
  w   
 p  p 
 
    c 
This means that in any group formation games  the matching of unqeual types can never be 
a core outcome  because 
   p  p     p 
 
  p 
 
     p  p 
 
     p 
 
  p 
To see this  simply use   and grind away at the algebra   it s easy  Thus group lending 
gives rise to positive assortative matching 
Now we can study how joint liability contracts such as these may be used to overthrow 
the individual liability equilibrium  Assuming   using the above argument   that similar 
types will pair together  we may conclude that the return to a p-pair from a contract  r  c  is 
   
 
 p     R   rp    p    p c 
Now consider a variation of  r  c  around the single liability contract  r 
 
    such that r   r 
 
 
c     and which leaves the marginal type  under the old equilibrium    p r 
 
  unaffected 
Writing p 
    p r 
 
  this means  using   that 
 p 
 
     p 
 
dr   p 
 
    p 
 
 dc    
From this expression  notice that if p   p 
 
  then  recalling that dr     and dc      p     
while if p   p 
 
then  p      by the same token 
With this in mind  shift things a little bit so that  p 
 
      but  p      if p   p 
      Then 
all types p below this threshold would still go to the single liability contract  Thus a tiny 
change in the terms of the contract to a joint liability contract by one lender will completely 
change the mix of the applaicants that he gets  generating positive profits for him  It is in 
this way that an individual liability equilibrium is wiped out by the introduction of joint 
liability contracts 
 
  An Informal Extension to Entrepreneurship  To illustrate this last point  let us 
redo and extend the two-skills example with private firms  What follows is just an informal 
discussion with Suppose that production requires a setup cost S that must be borne up 
front  Suppose that there are two wealth levels in the society    and W  which exceed S 
Assume  moreoever  that there are just two productivity levels        and       and that the 
production function is given by  F L  where L is the amount of labor hired  Finally  assume 
that the high-productivity type can cover the setup cost of production 
In this economy  production will be carried out by those individuals for whom wealth equals 
W and       Let a be the fraction of such people  Note the following 
  Credit Policy 
 i  People with low wealth who are productive will not be able to bear the setup cost  and 
this will be a loss to society  An increase in inequality that puts more people below the 
threshold needed to finance setup costs will result in greater economic loss at the aggregate 
level 
 ii  Assuming that the correlation between productivity and wealth is nonnegative  we see 
that the loss is greatest when the correlation is zero  this is when a assumes its highest value 
The loss is minimal when productive types are only to be found among the wealthy  this 
may be true if wealth is an indicator of past productivity  and if productivity exhibits high 
serial correlation  both of which are strong assumptions 
 iii  The positive association between equality and greater efficiency depends critically on 
the average wealth level in the society  If the average wealth level is high  then an increase 
in equality puts more people above the threshold S needed to start up production  On 
the other hand  if the average wealth level is low  then an increase in equality may throw 
more individuals under the threshold  creating an even greater loss of efficiency  Thus poor 
societies may be caught in a double-bind  where the  intrinsic  need for redistribution is 
higher  the functional implications may be negative 
 iv  Denote the demand curve for labor by L   where the demand curve is obviously only 
defined for the high types and where   stands for the market wage  Then an increase in 
inequality  assuming that we are not in the low average wealth trap  will lower a and move 
the aggregate demand curve aL  to the left   So will a lowering of a caused by reduced 
correlation between productivity and wealth  If the wage rate is endogenous  it will go 
down 
 v  This effect is heightened if those who cannot afford the setup costs to run a business 
must join the labor force   the supply curve of labor shifts to the right at the same time 
that the demand curve for labor shifts to the left  Effects  iv  and  v  are precisely the sort 
of interactive implications highlighted by authors such as Banerjee and Newman  
Inequality affects macroeconomic variables  such as the level of employment or the wage 
rate 
 vi  Continuing this theme  we see that had we posited a slightly more complex model with a 
continuum of productivity types  then productivity types which are supposed to be inactive 
at the first best would enter production  This is because the equilibrium wage rate is low 
relative to the first best  so that certain productivity types which would have not covered 
the setup cost at the first best are now able to do so at the equilibrium wage rate   These are 
wealthy people as well 
 vii  Adopting a slight political-economy perspective  we can see why coalitions of producers 
might now want to oppose policies that provide better credit to the poor  even though these 
policies may not be overtly redistributive

Nature and Scope of Economics 
Introduction 
Economics is a social science which deals with human wants and their 
satisfaction  It is mainly concerned with the way in which a society chooses to employ 
its scarce resources which have alternative uses  for the production of goods for 
present and future consumption 
Political economy is another name for economics   Polis  in Greek means a 
State  The early writers used the term  Political Economy  for the management of the 
State  A person who runs a family is expected to make the best use of the income 
of the household  Similarly  the State is expected to get the maximum benefit for the 
society  Hence the term  Political Economy 
The existence of human wants is the starting point of all economic activity in 
the world  Unless we make efforts  we cannot satisfy wants  Hence  wants  efforts 
and satisfaction form the circle of economics  We may say economics is the science 
of wants  But in the real world  the means which satisfy our wants are limited  that 
is  there is scarcity of the means which satisfy our wants  Time and money are 
limited  And land  labour and capital which are used in production are limited  Though 
science has increased our resources  our wants have also increased  We may satisfy 
some wants now  But soon  new wants appear  But all our wants cannot be satisfied 
because means are limited 
We study economics because there is scarcity of many goods we want 
This problem is common to the individual as well as the State  That is why we say 
Economics is the science of scarcity  And scarcity is the basic fact of life 
Our wants are unlimited but means are limited  This leads to choicemaking 
If there is unlimited supply of goods which satisfy our wants  the problem of choice 
will not arise  It is true that we have many wants  But all wants are not of equal 
importance  So we choose the more important and the more urgent wants  So choice 
is the essence of economic activity  We may also say that economics is the science 
of choice  Of course  all goods we want are not scarce  There are certain things like 
air and sunshine which are available in abundance  Though they are very essential 
for our life  we do not pay any price for them  They are free goods and they are not 
very important for our study  But many things we want are scarce and we have to 
pay a price for them  So  in economics  we study how prices of different things are 
determined  We may also say that economics is a science that deals with pricing 
process 
Modern economy is a monetary economy  Prices are paid in money  So 
money plays an important role in the economic life of a society  It is used for buying  
 
and selling of goods  for payment of rent  wages  interest and so on  In economics 
we study about the role of money in the affairs of mankind 
We shall now sum up our discussion about the nature of economics 
Economics is a social science which studies about human wants and their 
satisfaction  Human wants are unlimited  So scarcity is the fundamental fact of life 
As all wants are not of equal importance  this leads to choice  Economics is the 
science of choice  As there is scarcity of goods  we have to pay a price for them 
So  economics studies about the pricing process  And  as prices are paid in money 
we study about the part played by money in the economic life of a society  We study 
how people get and spend money  how they earn a living and how it affects their way 
of life and so on  All the scarce goods which satisfy our wants are known as wealth 
So  in economics  we study about the production of wealth  exchange of wealth 
distribution of wealth and consumption of wealth  As wealth is produced to promote 
human welfare  we study the relationship between wealth and welfare 
Definitions of Economics 
We can have a good idea about the nature and scope of economics by 
studying some of the important definitions of economics  Some of the important 
definitions of economics are those of leading economists like Adam Smith  Alfred 
Marshall  Lionel Robbins and Samuelson 
Adam Smith s Definition  Wealth Definition 
Adam Smith  -  defined economics as follows    Economics is the 
science of wealth  He is the author of the famous book  Wealth of Nations   
He is known as the Father of Political Economy because he was the first person who 
put all the economic ideas in a systematic way  It is only after Adam Smith  we study 
economics as a systematic science 
The term  wealth  has a special meaning in Economics  In the ordinary 
language  by  wealth  we mean money  but in economics  wealth refers to those 
goods which satisfy human wants  But we should remember all goods which satisfy 
human wants are not wealth  For example  air and sunlight are essential for us  We 
cannot live without them  But they are not regarded as wealth because they are 
available in abundance and unlimited in supply  We consider only those goods which 
are relatively scarce and have money value as wealth 
We study about consumption  production  exchange and distribution of 
wealth  J S  Mill defined economics as  the practical science of the production and 
distribution of wealth  Adam smith was of the view that economics was concerned 
with the problems arising from wealth-getting and wealth-using activities of people 
He was interested mainly in studying the ways by which the wealth of all nations 
could be increased 
 
Criticism 
There is a lot of criticism against Adam Smith s definition of economics  It has 
got a bad name for economics  Some social scientists like Ruskin and Carlyle called 
it  a dismal science   a dark science  But this criticism is unfair  because it is based 
on a misunderstanding about the nature and scope of economics  As this definition 
emphasized  wealth  they thought it is all about money  They concluded that 
economics taught men and women how to make money  So they called it a selfish 
science as in their opinion it emphasized on  the means to get rich 
The above charge against economics is a false one  In economics  wealth 
does not refer to money  It refers to the scarce goods which satisfy our wants 
Moreover  early economists used the term  wealth  in the sense of welfare 
A great demerit of Adam Smith s definition is that there is overemphasis on 
wealth  There is no doubt that we have to study about wealth in economics  But it can 
be only a part of the study  There is the other side  In fact  it is a more important side 
and that is the study of man  Economics is a social science  Hence the proper study 
of mankind should be man and not wealth alone 
When we discuss Adam Smith s definition of economics  we have to keep in 
mind the time in which he lived  He was writing his book at a time when England 
was on the eve of Industrial Revolution  The large investments of capital and use of 
largescale machinery enabled England to produce wealth on a large scale  So it is 
only natural that Adam Smith emphasized on wealth and considered economics as 
 an enquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations 
Alfred Marshall s Definition  Welfare Definition 
Alfred Marshall  -  wrote a book Principles of Economics in  
In it  he defined economics as  a study of mankind in the ordinary business of life 
An altered form of this definition is    Economics is a study of man s actions in the 
ordinary business of life 
Marshall agrees that economics studies about wealth  But he does not accept 
the view that economics studies about wealth alone  In the words of Marshall 
 Economics is on the one side a study of wealth  and on the other and more 
important side  a part of the study of man  Man is the centre of his study  According to 
him  the study of man is more important than the study of wealth 
In economics  we do not study about all aspects of humankind  As Cairncross 
puts it  economics studies about man as  buyer and seller  producer and consumer 
saver and investor  employer and worker  It studies about how people get their 
income  how they use it and how they make best use of their resources 
Economics studies how people try  to increase the material means of wellbeing 
 
According to this definition  we may say that economics is the study of the 
causes of material welfare 
Marshall s definition is known as material welfare definition of economics 
because of its emphasis on welfare 
Criticism 
There is no doubt that Marshall s definition is a great improvement over the 
definition of Adam Smith  For its emphasis is on social problems  And economics is 
a social science  Moreover  it tells us about the link between wealth and welfare  But 
the main idea of Marshall that economics is a science that deals with material welfare 
has been strongly criticized  Lionel Robbins is a great critic of this definition  He says 
that Marshall s definition misrepresents the science of economics 
First  if we go by the definition of Marshall  in economics we should consider 
only those activities which promote material welfare  But many activities do not 
promote welfare but are rightly considered as economic activity  For example 
we know that alcoholic drinks and cigarettes are bad for our health  But these 
commodities are produced and sold  There is a market for them  And there are 
buyers and sellers  So the production and distribution of these goods is economic 
activity  Let us take another example  War does not promote material welfare  But 
we have  economics of war  And it is an important branch of economics  There are 
many economic problems with regard to war  Sometimes  the economic causes of 
war are more important than the political and social causes  So it is not right to say 
that economics studies material welfare 
Second  some activities promote welfare but not material welfare  For 
example  the activities of doctors  lawyers  actors  musicians promote our welfare 
But their labour does not result in the production of material goods  If we follow the 
material welfare definition of economics  we cannot consider the activities of the 
above categories of labour as economic activity as they do not promote material 
welfare  But we make use of their services  We pay a price  sometimes very high 
price  for their services  Their services have economic value  It is misleading to 
describe economics as the study of the causes of material welfare  In the words of 
Lionel Robbins   whatever economics is concerned with  it is not concerned with the 
causes of material welfare as such 
Third  Marshall s definition is classificatory  It is not analytical  It considers the 
production of material goods  e g  chairs  tables  cycles and cars  bread  alone as 
economic activity  As the services of a teacher or a judge do not produce material 
goods  they are not considered as economic activity  This is a wrong view  As Lionel 
Robbins says   we do not say the production of potatoes is economic activity and the 
production of philosophy is not 
 
Lastly  by introducing ethical concepts like welfare  economics will become 
an inexact science  For it is rather difficult to measure welfare  And some economic 
policies which promote the welfare of some people may affect the welfare of others 
In spite of the above criticism against Marshall s definition  we should not 
forget that Marshall has widened the scope of economics by establishing a link 
between wealth and man and his welfare 
Modern definitions of economics are based on a theory of scarcity and choice 
Lionel Robbins  definition  Scarcity Definition 
Lionel Robbins has defined economics as follows    Economics is the science 
which studies human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce means 
which have alternative uses 
Robbins has given the above definition in his book  An Essay on the Nature 
and significance of Economic Science 
The definition of Robbins is based on the following basic assumptions 
  Ends are various  The term  ends  mean wants  Human wants are unlimited 
  Means are limited  Means like time  money and resources are limited 
  We can put time and money to alternative uses  For example  though time 
is limited  we can use it for different purposes  We can use time for earning 
money or we may enjoy it as leisure  and 
  All wants are not of equal importance 
We have to note certain things here  The fact that we have many wants is not 
of interest to an economist by itself  For example if you want to do two things and you 
have enough time and means with which to do them  and you do not want the time or 
means for anything else  then you need not economize anything  Though your means 
are limited  if they do not have alternative uses  you cannot economize anything 
Further  if all wants are of equal importance  you cannot economize anything  We 
know time is limited  There are only   hours in a day  If a worker wants only money 
he has to work for long hours and forgo leisure  If he wants leisure  he has to forgo 
his income  He cannot have both at the same time 
We may  however  note that all means which satisfy human wants are not 
limited  For example  air and sunshine are available in abundance  They are free 
goods  But many things we want are scarce in relation to our wants  So economics 
studies human behaviour as a relationship between unlimited wants and scarce 
means  As means are limited  we have to pay a price for them  We study in 
economics how the prices of scarce goods are determined  We have to choose 
among different wants  That is why we say that scarcity and choice are central 
problems in economics  Economics is the science of choice 
 
Choice between alternatives is the basic principle underlying all economic 
activity  This is applicable to all economic systems   capitalism  socialism and mixed 
economy 
The capitalist economy is also known as market economy  There  the 
consumer will have a wider choice than in a socialist economy which is also known 
as command economy  A socialist economy is a planned economy  As all basic 
decisions are taken by the government  the consumer will have limited choice  And 
we have mixed economy  India is a good example of mixed economy where public 
sector and private sector play important roles in different economic fields  In some 
fields  the consumer has more choice and in other areas where the State has 
greater control  he has limited choice  But under all these systems  there is some 
kind of planning  it is a question of degree  And all economic life involves planning 
As Robbins puts it   To plan is to act with a purpose  to choose  and choice is the 
essence of economic activity  Lionel Robbins  definition is also known as scarcity 
definition of economics 
Criticism 
The definition of Marshall classified human behaviour into economic activity 
and non-economic activity  It considered only those activities which promoted 
material welfare as economic activity  But Robbins  definition covers the whole field 
If there is scarcity of a thing in relation to the demand for it  it becomes the subject  
matter of economics  That way  even the labour of those who provide services  eg 
lawyers  doctors  actors  are taken for study in economics 
Another merit of Robbins  definition is it makes economics a scientific study 
Ethical aspects of economic problems are not taken into account in discussions  In 
other words  the moral aspects are not considered  And it does not try to establish a 
link between economics and welfare  But some economists criticize this view  They 
say that as economics is a social science  its aim should be promotion of human 
welfare  That is why some economists say Robbins  definition has no human touch 
about it  It looks at economics only as the science of pricing process  But economics 
is more than a theory of value or resource allocation 
According to Robbins  an economic problem will arise only when there is 
scarcity  but it may arise during times of abundance as well  For example  the great 
depression of  s was caused not so much by scarcity but by plenty  That is why 
the world depression was described as poverty in the midst of plenty 
In spite of the above criticisms  we have to note that most of the economists 
have accepted the definition of Robbins because it emphasizes scarcity and choice 
which are two important facts of life under all economic  political and legal systems 
It is true that there have been improvements in the methods of production 
because of technological advancements  But scarcities are always with us  That is 
why we say economics is the science of scarcity 
 
Samuelson s Definition  Modern Definition of Economics 
Samuelson s definition is known as a modern definition of economics 
According to Samuelson   Economics is a social science concerned chiefly 
with the way society chooses to employ its resources  which have alternative uses  to 
produce goods and services for present and future consumption 
The above definition is general in nature  There are many common points in 
the definitions of Robbins and Samuelson 
Samuelson s definition tells us that economics is a social science and it 
is mainly concerned with the way how society employs its limited resources for 
alternative uses  All this we find in the definition of Robbins  But Samuelson goes a 
step further and discusses how a society uses limited resources for producing goods 
and services for present and future consumption of various people or groups 
An interesting point that Samuelson tells is that the society may or may not 
make use of money 
Net Economic Welfare  NEW 
Samuelson has coined the concept of Net Economic Welfare 
 According to Samuelson   Net Economic Welfare  NEW  is an adjusted 
measure of total national output that includes only consumption and investment items 
that contribute directly to economic welfare 
As we become rich  generally  we prefer leisure to income  When we allocate 
more time for leisure  gross national product  GNP  may come down  But welfare 
goes up  So when we estimate GNP  we must include satisfaction  derived from 
leisure by giving it a value in Net Economic Welfare 
Women do a lot of work at home and it is not taken into account while 
calculating GNP  But we must include that while estimating GNP  Only then  we will 
get a correct picture of NEW 
In any society  there will be some illegal activities   eg  drug trade  We should 
not include it in NEW  They are  social bads 
There are some underground activities  Those who earn huge incomes  eg 
lawyers  accountants  actors  may not report actual income for tax purposes 
This unaccounted money  black money  must somehow be included in GNP 
estimates  Otherwise  we will get a lower figure for GNP 
During the process of economic growth  there will be environmental pollution 
To get NEW  we should deduct the cost of pollution from the G N P 
 
The concept of Net Economic Welfare has become very important in the study 
of National Income 
Main Divisions of Economics 
There are four main divisions of economics  They are consumption 
production  exchange and distribution  In modern times  economists add one more 
division and that is public finance  In public finance  we study about the economics of 
government  The economic functions of the modern State have increased to a great 
extent  So public finance has become an important branch of economics 
All the above divisions are interrelated  And they are dependent on each other 
Consumption 
Consumption deals with the satisfaction of human wants  There is economic 
activity in the world because there are wants  When a want is satisfied  the process 
is known as consumption  Generally  in plain language  when we use the term 
 consumption  what we mean is usage  But in economics  it has a special meaning 
We can speak of the consumption of the services of a lawyer  just as we speak of the 
consumption of food 
In the sub-division dealing with consumption  we study about the nature of 
wants  the classification of wants and some of the laws dealing with consumption 
such as the law of diminishing marginal utility  Engel s law of family expenditure and 
the law of demand 
Production 
Production refers to the creation of wealth  Strictly speaking  it refers to the 
creation of utilities  And utility refers to the ability of a good to satisfy a want  There 
are three kinds of utility  They are form utility  place utility and time utility  Production 
refers to all activities which are undertaken to produce goods which satisfy human 
wants  Land  labour  capital and organization are the four factors of production  In 
the sub- division dealing with production  we study about the laws which govern the 
factors of production  They include Malthusian Theory of population and the laws of 
returns  We also study about the localization of industries and industrial organization 
Exchange 
In modern times  no one person or country can be self-sufficient  This gives 
rise to exchange  In exchange  we give one thing and take another  Goods may 
be exchanged for goods or for money  If goods are exchanged for goods  we call it 
barter  Modern economy is a money economy  As goods are exchanged for money 
we study in economics about the functions of money  the role of banks and we also 
study how prices are determined  We also discuss various aspects of international 
trade 
 
Distribution 
Wealth is produced by the combination of land  labour  capital and 
organization  And it is distributed in the form rent  wages  interest and profits  In 
economics  we are not much interested in personal distribution  That is  we do 
not analyse how it is distributed among different persons in the society  But we 
are interested in functional distribution  As the four factors or agents of production 
perform different functions in production  we have to reward them 
Public Finance 
Public finance deals with the economics of government  It studies mainly 
about the income and expenditure of government  So we have to study about 
different aspects relating to taxation  public expenditure  public debt and so on 
Conclusion 
We may note that the subject of economics is divided into consumption 
production  exchange  distribution  and public finance only for the sake of 
convenience 
We should not look at it in a rigid way  We must not consider them as 
watertight compartments  They are related to each other and they are interdependent 
also  For example  we cannot have consumption without production  The aim of 
production is creation of wealth  And we produce wealth not for its own sake but 
for the satisfaction of human wants  In other words  we produce goods because 
we want them for consumption  So the ultimate aim of production is promotion of 
human welfare  Production is means and consumption is the end  Generally  people 
produce goods for market  So exchange takes place  Exchange is the connecting link 
between production and consumption  The economic welfare of people in a nation 
depends on how wealth is produced and on how it is distributed  If there is no proper 
distribution  it will result in inequalities of income and wealth  This  in turn  will affect 
consumption and production  So we find that all the divisions of economics are 
interrelated and interdependent 
Economics   positive or normative science  
There is no need for us to ask the question whether economics is a positive 
science or normative science  Instead of that  we may look at it as a subject that has 
two parts  namely positive economics and normative economics  As Asimakopulos 
puts it   positive economics can be defined as a body of systematized knowledge 
concerning what is  while normative economics tries to develop criteria for what ought 
to be 
Positive economics is mainly concerned with the description of economic 
events and it tries to formulate theories to explain them  But in normative economics 
we give more importance to ethical judgements  Normative economics is concerned 
with the ideal rather than the actual situations 
 
Statements on economics may be classified into positive statements and 
normative statements  If there is disagreement over a statement  we can find out 
whether it is true or false by verifying facts  But when there is disagreement over 
a normative statement  we cannot settle the issue simply by appealing to facts 
The questions   what are the policies that the Government should follow to reduce 
unemployment   what should it do to reduce inflation   are all questions in positive 
economics  On the other hand  if we ask the question   should the government be 
more concerned about unemployment than inflation   then it is a normative one 
Economists like Lionel Robbins believe that we must leave normative questions 
such as what ought to be done to political and moral philosophy and that we must 
study and analyse only positive questions  Robbins tells that an economist as 
an economist has no business to pronounce judgements on the ethical aspects of 
economic question  He feels that if normative considerations are taken into account 
economics cannot be an exact science  But many economists differ from this view 
They believe that as economics as a social science has to promote human welfare 
we have to consider ethical issues in economics  Now  we have a new and important 
branch of economics known as  welfare economics 
Economics in relation to other social sciences 
Economics is a social science which deals with human wants and their 
satisfaction  It is related to other social sciences like sociology  politics  history 
ethics  jurisprudence and psychology  For example  the economic development of 
a nation depends not only on economic factors but also on historical  political and 
sociological factors  Our country did not have much of economic progress during 
the British rule owing to historical reasons  Again  we had slow but steady economic 
growth in our country because of political stability  But in many other countries  there 
was no steady growth because of political instability  If there is one government today 
and another government tomorrow  there will not be economic development in that 
country 
We shall discuss  in some detail  economics in its relation to other social 
sciences 
Economics and Sociology 
Sociology is the science of society  Social sciences like politics and economics 
may be considered as the branches of sociology  Sociology is a general social 
science  It attempts to discover the facts and laws of society as a whole  Sociology 
deals with all aspects of society  But economics deals only with the economic aspects 
of a society  It studies human behaviour in relation to scarce means and unlimited 
wants  For a student of sociology  social institutions like marriage  religion  political 
institutions and economic conditions are all important subjects for study  But in 
economics  we are interested in them only to the extent that they affect the economic 
life of a society  And we cannot properly understand the economic conditions of a  
 
society without considering its sociological aspects  Though economics is a branch of 
sociology  we must look at it as a separate and distinct branch 
Economics and Politics 
Both economics and politics are social sciences and there is a close 
connection between them  Politics is the science of the State or political society  It 
studies about man in his relation to the State 
The production and distribution of wealth are influenced to a very great extent 
by the government  We have economic planning in our country  And the main aim of 
planning is to increase the national income by increasing production and by a proper 
distribution of income 
The Planning Commission  which is an agency of the government  plays 
a vital role in it  Some of the important questions like nationalization  privatization 
and prohibition are all economic as well as political questions  Elections are fought 
often in many countries on economic issues  Unemployment  labour disputes are 
all economic issues  But government has to tackle them  The relationship between 
economics and politics is so great that the early economists described economics as 
political economy 
Sometimes  political ideas and institutions are influenced by economic 
conditions  For example  socialism was born of economic inequalities and 
exploitation in England during the industrial revolution  Karl Marx is considered as the 
Father of  scientific  socialism 
Economics and History 
Economics and history are closely related  History is a record of the past 
events  In history  we survey economic  political and social conditions of the people 
in the past  To a student of history  love affairs  marriages and even murders of 
kings are important subjects of study  For example  the murder of Julius Caesar 
is important for a student of Roman history  In our country  the religious policy of 
Mughal emperors is important for a student of history  But we are interested in history 
only to the extent that it will help us in understanding economic problems of the past 
As students of economics  we are interested in things like taxation and other 
sources of revenue and standard of living in the past 
In economics  we make use of historical data to formulate economic laws  We 
make use of history in economics to study the material conditions of people in the 
past  There is a separate branch of economics known as  Economic History 
We may say economics is the fruit of history and history in the root of 
economics 
 Economics without history has no root 
History without economics has no fruit 
 
Economics and Ethics 
Ethics is a social science  It deals with moral questions  It discusses the rules 
that govern right conduct and morality  It deals with questions of right and wrong  It 
aims at promoting good life 
There is connection between economics and ethics  While economics 
according to Marshall  aims at promoting material welfare  ethics aims at promoting 
moral welfare  When we discuss economic problems  often we consider ethical 
issues  The government introduced prohibition in many states for ethical reasons 
though there was heavy loss of revenue to it 
But Lionel Robbins strongly believes that an economist as an economist 
should not consider ethical aspects of economic problems  But many economists 
do not agree with him  They believe that economics cannot be dissociated from 
ethics  Even Marshall considered economics as a handmaid of ethics  He looked at 
economics as a study of means to better the conditions of human life 
Economics and Jurisprudence 
Jurisprudence is the science of law  The economic progress of a nation 
depends to a great extent on its legal system  Good laws promote economic 
progress and bad laws act as an impediment to growth  For example  in the past 
when we welcomed foreigners to invest in our country  they used to say our taxation 
was complex and not good  Of course  now things have improved  So we must 
have simple and clear laws in the fields of taxation and labour legislation to promote 
economic progress 
Economics and psychology 
Psychology is the science of mind  It deals with all kinds of human behaviour 
For example  we have child psychology  mob psychology  industrial psychology 
and criminal psychology  But economics studies one aspect of human behaviour 
It studies human behaviour with reference to unlimited wants and limited means 
Of late  psychology has become important in analyzing economic problems  To 
deal with labour problems  we must understand industrial psychology  And a good 
businessman must understand the psychology of buyers whenever he wants 
to change the price of his good  Many important laws of economics are based on 
psychology  For example  we have the law of diminishing marginal utility  It tells that 
the more and more of a thing you have  the less and less you want it 
Economics  mathematics and statistics 
Among other sciences  economics is related to mathematics and statistics 
Statistics is the science of averages  It is the science of counting  Many tables and 
diagrams used in economics are based on statistical analysis  Mathematical methods 
are largely used in modern economics 
 
Now we have a new science called econometrics  It makes use of statistics 
and mathematics in economics  The econometric society was founded in   and 
the first Nobel prize in economics was awarded to Jan Tinberen and Ragnar Frisch 
for their contribution to econometrics 
Static and dynamic concepts 
Time element is very useful in studying the working of an economy  There 
are two main lines of approach  They are   static analysis and   dynamic analysis 
In the case of static analysis  we examine a problem at any given moment of time 
Even in static analysis  sometimes we consider a short period rather than a single 
point  We assume that some changes take place during the short period  The 
method of approach where we take note of changes in the short period is known as 
comparative statics  For example  in comparative statics  we compare the state of 
economy at one moment to the state of the economy at another moment  Marshall s 
analysis of supply and demand is a good example of comparative statics 
In dynamic analysis  we examine the path or process by which the economy 
moves from one state of equilibrium to another  Time element is an important factor 
in dynamic analysis  Change is the key word in dynamic analysis  For example 
investment during a period may depend upon the rate of interest in the previous 
period  The study of the trade cycle may be given as a good example of dynamic 
analysis 
Stocks and flows 
Stocks and flows are basic concepts in economics  Stocks can be measured 
at a given point of time  A flow is a quantity that can be measured only in terms of a 
specified period of time  In other words  it has a time dimension  For example  wealth 
is a stock and income is a flow 
Micro economics and macro economics 
Economic theory can be broadly divided into micro economics and 
macroeconomics  The term micro means small and macro means large 
In microeconomics  we deal with problems such as the output of a single 
firm or industry  price of a single commodity and spending on goods by a single 
household 
Macroeconomics studies the economic system as a whole  In it  we get a 
complete picture of the working of the economy  It is a study of the relations between 
broad economic aggregates such as total employment  saving and investment  We 
may also say that macro economics is the theory of income  employment  prices and 
money  That is why macroeconomics is sometimes studied under the title  Income 
and Employment Analysis 
 
Economics as a science 
We no longer ask the question whether economics is a science or an art 
Science is a systematized body of knowledge  Just as physics and chemistry are 
sciences  economics is also a science  We observe facts  conduct experiments and 
make generalizations in physics and chemistry after testing the results  The same 
scientific methods are followed in economics also  Economics  like all other sciences 
studies the relationship between cause and effect 
Sciences may be broadly divided into physical sciences and social sciences 
Physics and chemistry are examples of physical sciences  Economics is a social 
science  It studies about a particular aspect of human behaviour  And human 
behaviour is full of complexity  It is not easy to study it  So economic science is not as 
precise and exact as the physical sciences 
But economics has a greater right to be considered as a science than other 
social sciences like politics or history because in economics we make use of money 
as a measuring rod of utility  It is true that it is only a rough measure but still it 
enables us to give concrete shape to the laws of economics  Sometimes  what we 
say in economics may not come true in real life  But this is the case with many other 
sciences  For example  we joke about weather forecasts  The weather report in the 
newspaper may say that there will be heavy rainfall on a particular day  But there 
might not be any rain at all on that particular day  On account of that  we cannot 
say that meteorology  the science of weather  is not a science  Similarly  if some 
economic laws do not come true  we cannot say that economics is not a science 
Methods of Economic Analysis 
In economics  broadly we make use of two methods 
  Deductive method and 
  Inductive method 
The deductive method is also known as abstract method or analytical method 
This method is based on a priori reasoning and conclusions are drawn from certain 
fundamental assumptions  Deduction method was very popular among the Greeks 
Here is an example  
All men are mortal 
Socrates is a man 
Socrates is mortal 
The deductive method moves from the general assumption to the specific 
application 
Ricardo  a classical economist  made use of the deductive method 
 
The inductive method moves from specific observations to generalization  It 
was Francis Bacon who advocated inductive method in scientific enquiry 
None of the above methods provides satisfactory system for solution of 
problems  So Darwin  who is famous for this theory of evolution  by introducing the 
concept of hypothesis  has combined deductive and inductive methods 
The important elements of Darwin s deductive-inductive method are 
  Identification of a problem 
  formulation of hypothesis  a hypothesis is an assumption or an intelligent 
guess 
  collection  organization and analysis of data 
  formulation of conclusions 
  verification  rejection or modification of the hypothesis after testing it 
In the past  there was a debate among economists about the question which 
is the best method   inductive or deductive   But the controversy is not there now 
Today  economists feel that both induction and deduction are necessary for the 
science  just as the right and the left foot are needed for walking 
Economic Laws 
Like other social sciences  economics has its own laws  A law is a statement of 
what must happen given certain conditions  Every cause has a tendency to produce 
some result  For example  in Physics  we study that things fall to the ground because 
of gravitation  The law of gravitation is a statement of tendency  Similarly  the laws 
of economics are statements of tendencies  For example  according to the law of 
demand  when there is fall in the price of a good  the demand for it will expand  It 
means that there is a tendency among people to buy more when there is fall in the 
price of a good  Similarly  if price rises  they will buy less  Laws operate under certain 
conditions  If these conditions change  they will not operate  This is applicable to all 
sciences  When some economic laws do not operate  it means that the conditions 
have changed 
We may broadly classify sciences into physical sciences and social sciences 
Physics and chemistry are examples of physical sciences  Economics  politics are 
examples of social sciences  The laws of physical sciences are exact  But the laws 
of economics are not as exact as the laws of physical sciences  For example  we 
have the law of gravitation  It is a simple and exact statement  But in economics 
we deal with human beings and their behaviour with reference to economic activity 
We cannot conduct experiments with human beings either within the laboratory or 
outside it  That is why economic laws cannot be as exact as the laws of physical 
sciences  We may also note that we study about average human behaviour in 
economics 
 
As economics deals with man and his behaviour  its laws are complex 
and inexact  That is why Marshall has said that  the laws of economics are to be 
compared with the laws of tides rather than with the simple and exact law of 
gravitation  The science of tides explains the tides rise and fall under the influence of 
the Sun and the Moon  Probably there will be high tide on a full moon night  It may be 
there or it may not be there  It is only a probability 
Similarly  economic laws also indicate probable trends  For example  when 
there is increase in the quantity of money  there may be increase in the price level 
But we cannot say exactly by how much prices will rise  But economic laws are more 
exact than the laws of history and politics because economics make use of money 
as a measuring rod of utility  Though money is a rough measure  it gives a concrete 
shape to economic laws 
All economic laws are based on certain assumptions  Let us take the law of 
demand  It tells that  other things being equal  when the price of a good falls  people 
will buy more of the good  By  other things being equal  we mean   that the income 
of the people remains the same    that their tastes remain the same   that the 
prices of other goods remain the same  and   that no new substitute for the good is 
discovered  The law will hold good only when the above assumptions are fulfilled 
Sometimes  it is said that the laws of economics are hypothetical  That is  we 
make an hypothesis  Only after it is verified by facts and experiments and found true 
it becomes a law  But many economic laws cannot be verified by experiment  That is 
why we say sometimes that economic laws are hypothetical 
The laws of physical sciences have universal application  But that is not 
generally the case with regard to economic laws  Of course  there are one or two 
exceptions  The Law of Diminishing Returns has universal application 
Importance of Economic Laws 
Economic laws are of great importance in practical life  Some economic laws 
are applicable to all types of economic systems  They have universal application  For 
example  we have the law of Diminishing Returns  There are other important laws 
such as the law of diminishing marginal utility and the law of demand 
Some economists believe that the quantity theory of money is valid under all 
economic systems   capitalism or socialism or mixed economy 
Let us take some important laws like the law of diminishing marginal utility 
the law of demand  the law of diminishing returns and the Malthusian Theory of 
population and discuss their significance 
The law of diminishing utility is based on actual experience  It tells that the 
more and more of a thing you have  the less and less you want it  It explains the 
relationship between the price of a good and the satisfaction you get from it  During  
 
summer  generally  there will be fall in the price of mangoes because they are 
available in plenty  So there is diminishing utility  And as price is related to marginal 
utility  the price falls  Progressive taxation is based on the law of diminishing utility  As 
the income increases  the Government ask the rich to pay more taxes by increasing 
the rates of taxation for them  For it believes that as a man gets more and more 
money  he will get diminishing utility from it  So even if he parts with more money  the 
sacrifice will not be much in his case 
The law of demand is based on actual experience  In practice we find that 
when price falls  demand increases  Price falls when supply is more  When there is 
increase in the supply of a good  its marginal utility diminishes  A seller will try to sell 
more of his good by reducing its price slightly 
The law of diminishing marginal returns has universal application  In 
agriculture  it means that we cannot double the output by doubling labour and capital 
The law applies to manufacturing industry also 
The Malthusian theory of population tells that population increases at a faster 
rate than food supply  It might not be an exact statement  But it was true in the case 
of most of the poor countries of the world until the Green Revolution  The Green 
Revolution helped in increasing agricultural productivity  There is the problem of 
over  population in most of the poor countries of the world  That is why they spend 
huge amounts on family planning to reduce population growth  So  most of the laws 
of economics are of great practical importance 
Basic Concepts 
Every science has its own language  Economics has its own language  There 
are certain terms which are used in a special sense in economics  So we must 
understand the meaning of some basic concepts like wealth  goods  income  value 
price and market  If we do not understand their meaning properly  it may result in a lot 
of confusion 
Wealth 
In ordinary speech  when we refer to wealth  we mean money  But in 
economics  it has a special meaning  It refers to those scarce goods which satisfy 
our wants and which have money value  We may consider anything that has money 
value as wealth in economics 
All economic goods have value in exchange  So wealth includes all economic 
goods  Wealth has been defined as  stock of goods existing at a given time that have 
money value 
 
Characteristics of Wealth 
The following are the characteristics of wealth  
  It must possess utility  It must have the power to satisfy a want  As Marshall says 
 they must be desirable 
  It must be limited in supply  For example  air and sunshine are essential for life 
We cannot live without them  But we do not consider them as wealth because they 
are available in large quantities  Such goods are known as free goods 
  Wealth should be transferable  That is  it should be possible for us to transfer the 
ownership from one person to another 
  It must have money value 
  It may be external  For example  the goodwill of a company is external wealth 
Utility  scarcity and transferability are thus important characteristics of wealth 
Classification of Wealth 
Wealth may be classified into a  personal wealth  individual wealth  b  social 
wealth  collective wealth  c  national wealth  a   b  and d  cosmopolitan wealth  e g 
ocean 
Goods 
Anything that satisfies a human want can be considered as  good  in 
economics  In economics  the term  goods  refer to material and non-material things 
Just as an apple or a chair is a good  music or the services of actors  musicians and 
teachers are some of the examples of goods 
Goods can be classified into free goods and economic goods  Goods like 
air and sunlight which are the gifts of nature are free goods  They are not scarce 
So they do not command a price in the market  They are known as free goods 
Economic goods command a price in the market  In other words  they have valuein-exchange 
For  they are scarce in relation to demand  In this connection  we have 
to remember that what is a free good in one place can become an economic good 
in another place  It all depends on the supply of a good and the demand for it  For 
example  in some villages firewood is a free good  But in a town where we have to 
pay a price for it  it becomes an economic good  Similarly  water which is a free good 
becomes an economic good when there is scarcity of water 
Goods may be further classified into   consumers goods and   producers 
goods  Consumers goods satisfy our wants directly  They can be classified into  
perishable goods  eg  vegetables  fish and music  and   durable goods  eg  a 
house  a car  a radio  Capital goods satisfy our wants indirectly  Machines that 
are used to make machines are called capital goods  For example  car is a sort of  
 
machine  It is a consumers  good  But there must be some other machine to make 
a car  That machine is known as capital good or producer good  But what is a 
consumers  good in one place can become a producers  good in another place  For 
example  when electricity is used for lighting purposes at home  it is a consumers 
good  But the same electricity when used in factories for industrial purposes  it 
becomes a producers  good 
Income 
In economics  when we refer to income  generally we mean money income 
According to Seligman   Income in the economic sense  is the flow of satisfactions 
from economic goods  We know that all economic goods form wealth  The main 
source of income is wealth  For example  if you own a house  it is your wealth  If 
you get rent from it  it is your income  There are two points about income   time and 
amount 
There are two kinds of income     money income and   Real Income 
Generally people earn their incomes in the form of money 
Money income is also known as nominal income  But the standard of living 
of people of a country depends on their real income  Real income depends upon 
the purchasing power of money and that in turn depends on the price level  Real 
income refers to the command of a person over actual commodities and services 
Just because money incomes of people increase  we cannot say they are better off  It 
all depends upon how many goods they can command 
Suppose  my money income is Rs    and price of one kilo of rice is Rs   
then I can buy one kilo of rice or my income is worth of only one kilo of rice  In the 
next month  my money income is raised to Rs    but the price of one kilo of rice is 
increased to Rs    Now my income is worth only   kilo of rice  Therefore  in spite of 
increase in money income  my real income has come down due to higher increase in 
price  Real income is price adjusted money income 
National Income   National income refers to the value of commodities and 
services produced by a country during a year 
Marshall defined national income as follows    The labour and capital of a 
country acting on its natural resources produce annually a certain net aggregate of 
commodities  material and immaterial  including services of all kinds  This is 
true net annual income or revenue of the country  or the national dividend 
From the national income of a country  we can find out whether the country is 
rich or poor  And from the composition of national income  we can find out the relative 
importance of agriculture  industry and service sector in the economy 
We get per capita income  i e  income per person per year  by dividing 
national income by the population of the country 
 
National Income 
 Population Per capita income  
Value 
The term  value  refers to the exchange qualities of a good  According to 
Marshall   the term value  is relative and expresses the relation between two things at 
a particular place and time 
Value is of two kinds   value in use and   value in  exchange  Although 
air  rain and sunshine have value in use  they do not have value in exchange  In 
economics  we are interested only in those goods which have value in exchange 
For a good to have value  in exchange  it must possess utility  it must be scarce in 
relation to demand and it must be possible for us to exchange it  In other words  all 
economic goods have value-in-exchange 
Value is generally measured in money and it is a relative term  The value of 
a thing changes according to time and situation  For example  ice has more value in 
summer than in winter 
Price 
When value is expressed in money  it is called price  Generally  economists 
make no distinction between value and price  All prices are related to one another 
They form the price system  The prices most familiar to us are the prices we pay 
for goods sold in market  that is  retail prices  Many payments like rent  wages and 
interest are also prices which we pay respectively to land  labour and capital  Price 
system plays a very important role in a capitalistic economy  Buyers express their 
desire for goods only through prices  Every price we pay for a good is a vote in 
favour of it  It is the price system that regulates the economic activity of a society 
Market 
In the ordinary language  market refers to a place where goods are bought 
and sold  Thus Koyambedu market in Chennai refers to a place where vegetables 
are sold  In economics  market does not refer to any particular place in which goods 
are bought and sold  But it refers to buying and selling of a commodity  In a market 
a commodity is bought and sold under given conditions and there will be a number 
of buyers and sellers who will be in close touch with each other  For example  a fish 
market refers to buying and selling of fish  here both buyers and sellers are in close 
contact  According to Benham   Market is any area over which the buyers and sellers 
are in close touch with one another either directly or through dealers  that prices 
obtainable in one part of market affect the prices paid in other parts 
Generally speaking  when we talk of markets  we refer to commodities that are 
bought and sold  But there are markets for things other than commodities  Thus there 
are labour markets  foreign exchange market  capital market and so on  For example   
 
we may say the market for an actor  say  X  is dull  So there may be a market for 
anything which has a price 
Classification of Markets   Markets may be classified according to space  time 
and the nature of competition  According to space markets are classified into local 
market  eg  vegetables  flowers  national market  e g  sarees  and international 
market  e g steel  cotton  sugar  tea 
Markets can also be classified according to the type of competition  Thus 
broadly we have perfect markets and imperfect markets 
Markets can also be classified into short period markets and long period 
markets according to time  If the period is short  demand plays an important role in 
the market and if the period is longer  supply plays an important role  Thus markets 
can be classified according to space  time and the nature of competition that prevails 
Importance of Economics 
Economics has become one of the important branches of social sciences  It 
is of great practical value in our daily life  In pure sciences  we study the subject to 
arrive at the truth  But an economist is a social scientist  He studies the subject not 
only to know the truth for its own sake  but to find out a way for many economic 
and social problems of the society   Knowledge for the sake of knowledge  is not the 
goal of an economist  Economics must be fruit-bearing  Of course  an economist has 
no readymade answer for immediate problems  But he can help the Government 
in making broad economic policies  According to Keynes   the theory of economics 
does not furnish a body of settled conclusions immediately applicable to policy  It is 
a method  rather than a doctrine  an apparatus of the mind  a technique of thinking 
which helps its possessor to draw correct conclusions 
Most of the problems of the modern State are economic in nature  So 
economists play an important role in the affairs of the State  During World War II 
the German economy was damaged heavily  There was inflation  shortage of goods 
and mass unemployment  But the German economy recovered quickly by following 
the advice of an economist Ludwig Erhard  The German recovery is considered an 
economic miracle 
Similarly  J M Keynes  had great influence on the economic policies of the 
American government when it was in great economic trouble during the  s 
In economics  we study about things like prices  rent  wages  interest  profits 
and taxation  All these affect every person one way or the other  It has been rightly 
said   you cannot be in any real sense a citizen  unless you are also in some degree 
an economist

Chapter  
Basic Economic Problems 
Economics is the science of making choice under conditions of scarcity  What 
are the basic issues about which choices are to be made  Any society must make 
choices about three important problems  They are 
  What to produce and in what quantities  
Food or weapons  if so  in what quantities  
Is it more food and less weapons or vice versa  
  How shall goods be produced 
Electricity from thermal power or from hydro power  
  For whom shall the goods be produced  
A few rich and many poor or most people in modest comfort  
These three basic problems are interdependent  The society must make 
proper choice about them in order to meet the development aspirations of people 
satisfactorily  The above three questions are common to all economies but every 
economic system attempts to make its own choice  The nature of a particular choice 
in a particular society depends on its specific economic system 
Economic Systems 
An economic system is a way of answering these basic questions  Different 
economic systems answer the above questions differently  An economic system 
refers to how the different economic elements will solve the central problems of 
an economy  what  how and for whom to produce  It refers to the production and 
distribution of goods and services within which economic activity takes place  It refers 
to the way different economic elements  individual workers and managers  productive 
organization such as factories or firms and government agencies are linked together 
to form an organic whole 
Economic system consists of various individuals and their institutions like 
banking institutions  educational institutions and economic institutions  The most 
general economic systems are 
  Traditional Economy 
  Capitalist Economy 
  Socialist Economy 
  Mixed Economy 
 
I  Traditional Economy 
In traditional economy  the basic problems are solved by traditions and custom 
rules every aspect of behaviour  It produces exactly to its consumption requirements 
It is a subsistence economy  There is not much of sales as there is only small scale 
production  The same product will be produced by every generation  The production 
techniques are traditional 
II  Capitalist Economy 
A capitalist economy is an economic system in which the production and 
distribution of commodities take place through the mechanism of free markets 
Hence it is also called as market economy or free trade economy  Each individual be 
it a producer  consumer or resource owner has considerable economic freedom  An 
individual has the freedom to buy and sell any number of goods and services and to 
choose any occupation  Thus a market economy has no central coordinator guiding 
its operation  But self-organization emerges amidst the functioning of market forces 
namely supply  demand and price  The salient features of capitalism are 
  Right to Private Property  Individuals have the right to buy and own property 
There is no limit and they can own any amount of property  They also have legal 
rights to use their property in any way they like 
  Profit-Motive  Profit is the only motive for the functioning of capitalism  Production 
decisions involving high risks are taken by individual only to earn large profits 
Hence  profit-motive is the basic force that drives the capitalist economy 
  Freedom of Choice  The question  what to produce  will be determined by the 
producers  They have the freedom to decide  The factors of production can 
also be employed anywhere freely to get due prices for their services  Similarly 
consumers have the freedom to buy anything they want 
  Market Forces  Market forces like demand  supply and price are the signals 
to direct the system  Most of the economic activities are centered on price 
mechanism  Production  consumption and distribution questions are expected to 
be solved by market forces 
  Minimal role of Government  As most of the basic economic problems are 
expected to be solved by market forces  the government has minimal role in the 
economy  Their role will be limited to some important functions  They include 
regulation of market  defence  foreign policy  currency  etc 
Merits of Capitalist Economy 
  Increase in productivity  In a capitalist economy every farmer  trader or 
industrialist can hold property and use it in any way he likes  He increases the 
productivity to meet his own self-interest This in turn leads to increase in income 
saving and investment 
 
  Maximizes the Welfare  It is claimed that there is efficiency in production and 
resource use without any plan  The self-interest of individual also promotes 
society s welfare 
  Flexible System  The shortages and surpluses in the economy are generally 
adjusted by the forces of demand and supply  Thus it operates automatically 
through the price mechanism 
  Non-interference of the State  The State has a minimum role to play  There is no 
conflict between the individual interest and the society  The economic institutions 
function automatically preventing the interference of the government 
  Low cost and qualitative products  The consumers and producers have full 
freedom and therefore it leads to production of quality products at low costs and 
prices 
  Technological improvement  The element of competition under capitalism drives 
the producers to innovate something new to boost the sales and thereby bring 
about progress 
Disadvantages of Capitalist Economy 
  Inequalities  Capitalism creates extreme inequalities in income and wealth  The 
producers  landlords  traders reap huge profits and accumulate wealth  Thus the 
rich become richer and the poor poorer  The poor with limited means are unable 
to compete with the rich  Thus capitalism widens the gap between the rich and 
the poor creating inequality 
  Leads to Monopoly  Inequality leads to monopoly  Mega corporate units replace 
smaller units of production  Firms combine to form cartels  trusts and in this 
process bring about reduction in number of firms engaged in production  They 
ultimately emerge as multinational corporations  MNCs  or transnational 
corporations  TNCs  They often hike prices against the welfare of consumer 
  Depression  There is over-production of goods due to heavy competition  The rich 
exploit the poor  The poor are not able to take advantage of the production and 
hence are exploited  At another level  over-production leads to glut in the market 
and hence depression  This leads to economic instabilities 
  Mechanisation and Automation  Capitalism encourages mechanization and 
automation  This will result in unemployment particularly in labour surplus 
economies 
  Welfare ignored  Under capitalism  private enterprises produce luxury goods 
which give higher profits and ignore the basic goods required which give less 
profit  Thus the welfare of public is ignored 
 
  Exploitation of Labour  Stringent labour laws are enacted for the exclusive profitmotive 
of capitalists  Fire and hire policy will become the order of the day  Such 
laws also help to exploit the labour by keeping their wage rate at its lowest 
minimum 
  Basic social needs are ignored  There are many basic social sectors like literacy 
public health  poverty  drinking water  social welfare  and social security  As the 
profit margin in these sectors is low  capitalists will not invest  Hence most of 
these vital human issues will be ignored in a capitalist system 
III  Socialist Economy 
In a socialist economy  the means of production are owned and operated by 
the State  All decisions regarding production and distribution are taken by the central 
planning authority  Hence the socialist economy is also called as planned economy 
or command economy  The government plays an active role  Social welfare is 
given importance  hence equal opportunity is given to all  All such advantages have 
delivered high level of human development  Some of the most successful socialist 
economies are China  Cuba  Vietnam and North Korea  The following are the basic 
characteristic features of socialism 
  Social Welfare Motive  In socialist economies  social or collective welfare will be 
the prime motive  Unlike capitalism  profit will not be the aim of policy making 
The decisions will be taken keeping the maximum welfare of the people in mind 
Thus social well-being of people will be the purpose of development 
  Limited Right to Private Property  The right to private property is limited  All 
properties of the country will be owned by the State  That is  the ownership is 
collective in nature  Hence no individual can accumulate too much property as in 
the case of capitalism 
  Central Planning  Most of the economic policy decisions will be taken by a 
centralized planning authority  Each and every sector of the economy will be 
directed by well designed planning 
  No Market Forces  In a centralized planned system of development  market 
forces have only a limited role to play  Production  commodity and factor prices 
consumption and distribution will be governed by development planning with 
welfare motive 
Merits of Socialist Economy 
  Efficient use of resources  The resources are utilized efficiently to produce 
socially useful goods without taking the profit margin into account  Production is 
increased by avoiding wastes of competition 
 
  Economic Stability  Economy is free from business fluctuations  Government 
plans well and everything is well coordinated to avoid over-production or 
unemployment  There is stability because the production and consumption of 
goods and services are well regulated 
  Maximisation of Social Welfare  All citizens work for the welfare of the State 
Everybody receives his or her remuneration  The State concentrates on the 
production of basic necessaries instead of luxury goods  The State provides 
free education  cheap and congenial housing  public health amenities and social 
security for the people 
  Absence of Monopoly  The elements of corporation and monopoly are eliminated 
since there is absence of private ownership  The state is a monopoly but 
produces quality goods at reasonable price 
  Basic needs are met  In socialist economies  basic human needs like water 
education  health  social security  etc  are provided  Human development is more 
in socialist countries 
  No extreme inequality  As social welfare is the ultimate goal  there is no 
concentration of wealth  Extreme inequality is prevented in socialist system 
Demerits of Socialism 
  Bureaucratic Expansion  A socialist economy is operated under a centralized 
command and control system  People here work out of fear of higher authorities 
It does not give any initiative for the people to work hard 
  No Freedom  There is no freedom of occupation  Allocation of factors of 
production is not done rationally  Jobs are provided by the State  Place of work is 
also provided by the State  The consumer s choice is very limited 
  Absence of Technology  Work is monotonous and no freedom is given  Any 
change in the production process will alter the entire plan  Hence any innovation 
cannot be easily enforced  Everything is rigid and technological changes are 
limited 
  Absence of competition makes the system inefficient 
IV  Mixed Economy 
In a mixed economy  both public and private institutions exercise economic 
control  The public sector functions as a socialistic economy and the private sector 
as a free enterprise economy  All decisions regarding what  how and for whom to 
produce are taken by the State  The private sector produces and distributes goods 
and services  It manufactures consumer and capital goods in the interest of public 
welfare  A mixed economy possesses the freedom to hold private property  to earn 
profit  to consume  produce and distribute and to have any occupation  But if these  
 
freedoms affect public welfare adversely  they are regulated and controlled by the 
State  The main features of mixed economic system are 
  Co-existence of Public and Private Sectors  In a mixed economy  both the 
public and the private sectors initiatives will be there  The most strategically and 
nationally important sectors of the economy will be reserved for the public sector 
The rest will be left for private operation  While the public sector will have social 
welfare as the prime motive  the private sector will function with profit motive 
  Consolidation of merits of Capitalism and Socialism  As seen above  both 
capitalism and socialism have merits and demerits  Mixed economy is expected 
to retain only the merits of the two systems  For instance  the government 
is expected to allow private investment  but the government also controls 
monopolies 
  Planning  Economic planning is another important feature of the mixed economy 
Planning will direct the relative roles of public and private sectors and their 
respective jurisdictions 
Merits of Mixed Economy 
  Efficient resource utilisation  The resources are utilized efficiently as good 
features of both capitalism and socialism coexist  If there is misallocation of 
resources  the State controls and regulates it  This ensures the efficient utilization 
of resources 
  Prices are administered  The prices are not fixed always by forces of demand and 
supply  In the case of goods which are scarce  the prices are administered by the 
government and such goods are also rationed 
  Social Welfare  In a mixed economy  planning is centralized and there is overall 
welfare  Workers are given incentives and reward for any innovations  There is 
social security provided to the workers  Inequalities of income and wealth are 
reduced 
Demerits of Mixed Economy 
  Lack of Co-ordination  The coordination between the public and private sectors 
is poor in a mixed economy  Public sector spends huge public resources for 
infrastructure  The private sector aims at profit maximization by using the 
infrastructure created by the public sector  But they lack social responsibility 
and fail to spend for public causes like health  education  The private sector also 
dislikes any restriction imposed on it by the government 
  Red  tapism and delay by Public Sector  There is every chance that the public 
sector works inefficiently  There is too much of red-tapism and corruption 
leading to delays in decision-making and project implementation  They result in 
inefficiency and also affect production 
 
  Economic Fluctuations  The mixed economies experience economic fluctuations 
On the one hand  the private sector does not operate under very rigid conditions 
prescribed by the government  On the other hand  the public sector too does 
not operate under very rigid conditions enforced by the planned economy  The 
lack of policy coordination between private and public sector results in economic 
fluctuations 
Production Possibilities 
Another important question about the basic economic problems is  How do 
we make choice in an economy  At the individual level you must choose among 
alternatives like 
- whether to watch cricket highlights in T V  or study for another extra hour 
- whether to buy a text book for Rs  or spend the money for a movie 
- whether to help your mother in shopping or play hockey during that time 
It is important to note that choices are made due to scarcity  If there is no 
scarcity  there would be no need to choose  Similarly as choice must be made from 
alternatives  it involves comparison of cost and benefit 
Opportunity Cost 
When you choose a particular alternative  the next best alternative must be 
given up  For example  if you choose to watch cricket highlights in T V  you must give 
up an extra hour study  The choice of watching cricket in T V  results in the loss of the 
next best alternative- an extra hour study instead  Thus by watching T V  you have 
forgone the opportunity of scoring an extra five or ten marks in examination 
Thus the  opportunity cost  is the cost of something in terms of an opportunity 
forgone  and the benefits that could be received from that opportunity  In other 
words  the opportunity cost of an action is the value of next best alternative forgone 
The consideration of opportunity costs is one of the key differences between the 
concepts of  economic cost  and  accounting cost  Choices are mostly made on the 
basis of opportunity cost 
Production Possibility Curve 
Like the individuals  a society as whole has limited resources  It has to decide 
what to produce with the limited resource  It has to make choice about the quantity 
of different commodities  Choice emanates from scarcity  Thus our choice is always 
constrained or limited by scarcity of our resources  Suppose we have enough 
resources we can produce all that we want 
All such choices can be made with help of production possibility curve  The 
production-possibility curve separates outcomes that are possible for the society to 
produce from those which cannot be produced subject to the available resources 
 
Let us consider an economy with only so many people  so many industries 
so much of electricity and natural resources in deciding what shall be produced 
and how these resources are to be allocated among thousands of different possible 
commodities  How many industries are to produce steel  How much electricity to be 
provided for agriculture  how much for industries  Whether to provide free electricity 
to farmer or not  These problems are complicated  Therefore  to simplify let us 
assume there are only two goods to be produced - apples and oranges 
Table   Production Possibility Schudule 
Production Possibility 
Schedule Possibilities Quantity of Apples Quantity of Oranges 
A 
B 
C 
D 
E 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the above schedule A and E are possibilities where the economy either 
produces   percent of apples or   percent of oranges alone  But the production 
possibility curve assumes the production of two goods in different combinations 
Possibilities A  B C  D and E are such that the economy produces   units of apples 
and   units of oranges in possibility A    units of apples and   units of orange in 
possibility B    units of apples and   units of oranges in possibility C    unit of apple 
and   units of oranges in possibility D    unit of apples and   units of oranges in 
possibility E

B 
Orange 
       
 
 
 
 
O

U

Figure  
Production Possibility Curve 
 
Thus we see that if we are willing to have more of oranges  we should be 
willing to sacrifice more of apples  For instance  to reach possibility C from B  the 
economy produces   units more of oranges by sacrificing   unit of apples  A full 
employment economy must always- in producing one good be giving up something 
of another  This assumes of course  that at least some resources can be transferred 
from one good to another 
Such choice of one particular alternative involves opportunity cost of foregoing 
the other  Hence  the decisions of the society will be based on the comparison of 
costs and benefits of each alternative  In doing so  both the monetary and social cost 
and benefit should be the basis of any choice  Thus the one that gives the maximum 
benefit at minimum cost to the whole society should be the best choice  We can 
picture the production possibility schedule by drawing a smooth curve  Figure  
Units of oranges are measured horizontally and that of apples on the vertical 
axis  The curve A and E depict the various possible combinations of the two goods 
- A  B  C  D  and E  Thus a list of all the possible combinations of apples and oranges 
makes up production possibilities  The production possibility curve is also known 
as transformation curve or production possibility frontier  This curve shows the rate 
of transformation of one product into the other when the economy moves from one 
possibility point to the other 
All possible combinations lying on the production possibility curve show the 
combinations of the two goods that can be produced by the existing resources  Any 
combination lying inside the production curve such as U in the figure indicates that 
resources are not being fully employed in the best-known way  Any point outside 
the production possibility frontier  such as L implies that the economy does not have 
adequate resources to produce this combination  But a shift outside the production 
possibility frontier certainly indicates economic development  This is possible by 
technological advancement and increase in supply of factors of production

Chapter  
Theory of Consumer Behaviour 
Introduction 
The existence of human wants is the basis of all economic activity in a society 
All desires  tastes and motives of human beings are called wants in economics 
  Wants may arise due to elementary and psychological causes  The wants for 
food  clothing and housing are elementary and psychological 
  Wants may arise due to social causes  As members of society  we may require 
a particular type of dress and food 
  Wants arise due to customs and habits like drinking tea and chewing 
  Wants may arise due to advertisements 
In the early stages of civilisation  wants of men were few and simple  With 
advancement of civilisation  wants have become unlimited and also complex  Man 
tries to satisfy most of his wants through economic activity  Since the resources 
are limited  he has to choose between urgent wants and not so urgent wants  A 
systematic survey of this process is called consumption  Consumption means using 
up of goods and services in the satisfaction of human wants  The economics of 
consumption is related to a study of nature of wants and the behaviour of demand 
Characteristics of wants 
  Wants are unlimited  Man is a bundle of desires  There is no limit to human 
wants  If one set of wants are fulfilled  immediately another set of wants would be 
felt  Even the richest man will have a list of wants to be fulfilled 
  Every want is satiable  wants in general are unlimited  But a single or a 
particular want is satiable  We can completely satisfy a single want  A man is 
hungry and he requires food  By spending some money on food  he can get food 
and satisfy his hunger 
  Wants are competitive  Wants are unlimited  The resources and time at our 
disposal are much limited and we cannot satisfy all wants  So the wants will be 
competing to get satisfied  One set of wants may be competing with other set of 
wants to get preference of choosing first  For example  Raju has a sum of Rs 
With this amount of Rs  he has to choose between going to a movie  buying 
a magazine or buying vegetables  Of course  a consumer will choose the more 
urgent wants and distribute his income on several goods in such a manner as to 
get maximum satisfaction 
  Wants are complementary  Some wants are complementary in nature  i e  they 
have to be satisfied together  Though the want may be a single one  we require  
 
many commodities and services to satisfy that want  Want for  writing  includes 
want for paper  pen and ink  In some cases  wants may be both  competitive  and 
 complementary  For example  labour and machinery  Labour can be displaced 
by machinery  Machines cannot work without the help of labour 
  Wants are alternative  A want can be satisfied by two or more goods or by 
two or more methods  A want for hot drink may be satisfied by coffee or tea 
We may go by  bus  or  train  or by  taxi  to reach our destination  Thus  a want 
can be satisfied by many ways  These alternative goods or methods are called 
 substitutes 
  Wants vary with time  place and person  Wants are not static in character 
They are changing with time  place and person  We require hot drinks in winter 
and cool drinks in summer  People of England require warm woollen suits and 
rain coats  People of India require only cotton  The wants of a villager in Andhra 
Pradesh are different from a business magnet living in Bombay  The wants 
of our forefathers were different from the wants of the present generation  So 
wants vary with generation  culture  society  geographic location and the extent of 
economic development 
  Some wants recur again  Some wants are felt again and again  The want for 
food can be satisfied by eating food  Again the same want appear after a few 
hours  That is why we say wants are recurring in nature 
  Wants are influenced by advertisements  Effective advertisements through 
films  journals  radio and TV will create new wants and the existing wants get 
modified  Through advertisements and clever salesmanship  businessmen create 
tastes for their products 
  Wants become habits and customs  If a particular want is satisfied repeatedly 
by a commodity  then it becomes a habit  Example  drinking coffee and tea 
Wants become habits and habits are responsible for wants 
Classification of Wants 
In Economics  wants are classified into three categories  viz  Necessaries 
Comforts and Luxuries 
  Necessaries 
Necessaries are those which are essential for living  Man requires certain 
basic things to live  He wants food  clothing and shelter  Without these things  life is 
impossible 
  Comforts 
Comforts refer to those goods and services  which are not essential for 
living but which are required for a happy living  A TV  a sofa-cum- bed  a cushioned  
 
revolving chair may be stated under  comforts  Eating superior varieties of food may 
also add to the happiness of the consumer  Example  eating fruits  drinking milk etc 
Comforts promote efficiency also 
  Luxuries 
Those goods that are used to show off one s higher status in life  e g  diamond 
- studded jewels  are luxuries 
Significance of Necessaries  Comforts and Luxuries 
The classification of goods and services into necessaries  comforts and 
luxuries are only relative in their concept  They are not absolute concepts 
What is  comfort  to one may be a  necessity  to another and a  luxury  to a third 
man  A motorcar is necessary for a businessman and a doctor  It is a luxury for a 
student  What is necessary for a man in town may be a luxury for a villager  These 
classifications depend on the income of a person  his social status  his tastes and 
preferences 
Concept of Utility  Marshallian Approach 
There are two basic approaches to the study of consumer demand theory 
The first approach is the utility approach  It involves the use of measurable  cardinal 
utility to study consumer behaviour  Marshall is the chief exponent of the utility 
approach to the theory of demand  It is known as cardinal utility analysis or marginal 
utility analysis or Marshallian utility analysis  The second approach is the indifference 
curve approach which uses the idea of comparable utility  ordinal utility  J R Hicks 
and R G D Allen introduced the indifference curve approach 
Concept of Utility 
In the ordinary language   utility  means  usefulness  In Economics  utility is 
defined as the power of a commodity or a service to satisfy a human want 
Utility is a subjective or psychological concept  The same commodity or 
service gives different utilities to different people  For a vegetarian  mutton has no 
utility  Warm clothes have little utility for the people in hot countries  So utility depends 
on the consumer and his need for the commodity 
Total Utility 
Total Utility refers to the sum of utilities of all units of a commodity consumed 
For example  if a consumer consumes ten biscuits  then the total utility is the sum of 
satisfaction of consuming all the ten biscuits 
Marginal Utility 
Marginal Utility is the addition made to the total utility by consuming one more 
unit of a commodity  For example  if a consumer consumes   biscuits  the marginal  
 
utility is the utility derived from the  th unit  It is nothing but the total utility of  
biscuits minus the total utility of   biscuits 
Thus 
 MUn   TUn 
 - TU n- 
Where 
MUn   Marginal Utility of  nth  commodity 
TUn 
   Total Utility of n units 
TU n-  Total Utility of n-  units

Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility 
The law of diminishing marginal utility explains an ordinary experience of a 
consumer  If a consumer takes more and more units of a commodity  the additional 
utility he derives from an extra unit of the commodity goes on falling  Thus  according 
to this law  the marginal utility decreases with the increase in the consumption 
of a commodity  When marginal utility decreases  the total utility increases at a 
diminishing rate 
Gossen  Bentham  Jevons  Karl Menger contributed initially for the 
development of these ideas  But Alfred Marshall perfected these ideas and made it 
as a law  This Law is also known as Gossen s I Law 
Definition 
According to Marshall   The additional benefit which a person derives from a 
given increase of his stock of a thing diminishes with every increase in the stock that 
he already has 
Assumptions of the Law 
  The units of consumption must be in standard units e g  a cup of tea  a bottle of 
cool drink etc 
  All the units of the commodity must be identical in all aspects like taste  quality 
colour and size 
 
  The law holds good only when the process of consumption continues without any 
time gap 
  The consumer s taste  habit or preference must remain the same during the 
process of consumption 
  The income of the consumer remains constant 
  The prices of the commodity consumed and its substitutes are constant 
  The consumer is assumed to be a rational economic man  As a rational 
consumer  he wants to maximise the total utility 
  Utility is measurable 
Explanation 
Suppose Mr X is hungry and eats apple one by one  The first apple gives him 
great pleasure  higher utility  as he is hungry  when he takes the second apple  the 
extent of his hunger will reduce  Therefore he will derive less utility from the second 
apple  If he continues to take additional apples  the utility derived from the third apple 
will be less than that of the second one  In this way  the additional utility  marginal 
utility  from the extra units will go on decreasing  If the consumer continues to take 
more apples  marginal utility falls to zero and then becomes negative

Table   gives the utility derived by a person from successive units of 
consumption of apples 
From Table   and figure   it is very clear that the marginal utility  addition 
made to the total utility  goes on declining  The consumer derives   units of utility 
from the first apple he consumes  When he consumes the apples continuously  the 
marginal utility falls to   units for the fourth apple and becomes zero for the fifth  
 
apple  The marginal utilities are negative for the  th and  th apples  Thus when the 
consumer consumes a commodity continuously  the marginal utility declines  reaches 
zero and then becomes negative 
The total utility  sum of utilities of all the units consumed  goes on increasing 
and after a certain stage begins to decline  When the marginal utility declines and 
it is greater than zero  the total utility increases  For the first four units of apple  the 
total utility increases from   units to   units  When the marginal utility is zero  th 
apple  the total utility is constant   units  and reaches the maximum  When the 
marginal utility becomes negative  th and  th units  the total utility declines from  
units to   and then to   units 
Importance of Law of DMU 
 i  The Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility  DMU  is the foundation for various 
other economic laws  For example  the Law of Demand is the result of the 
operation of the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility  In other words  as more 
and more units of a commodity are consumed  each of them gives less and less 
marginal utility  This is due to the operation of the Law of DMU  As utility falls 
consumer is therefore willing to pay a lower price only 
 ii  The Law of DMU operates in the case of money also  A rich man already 
possesses a lot of money  If more and more money is newly added to his 
income  marginal utility of money begins to fall  Alfred Marshall assumed that 
the marginal utility of money remains constant 
 iii  This law is a handy tool for the Finance Minister for increasing tax rate on the 
rich 
 iv  Producers are guided by the operation the Law of DMU  unconsciously  They 
constantly change the design  the package of their goods so that the goods 
become more attractive to the consumers and they appear as  new goods  Or 
else  the consumers would think that they are using the same commodity  over 
and over  In such a situation  the Law of DMU operates in the minds of the 
consumers  Demand for such commodities may fall 
Criticism 
The Law of DMU is criticised on the following grounds 
 i  Deriving utility is a psychological experience  When we say a unit of X gives ten 
units of utility  this means that utility can be measured precisely  In reality  utility 
cannot be measured  For example  when a person sees a film and says it is 
very good  we cannot measure the utility he has derived from it  However  we 
can measure utility indirectly by the cinema fare he is willing to pay 
 
 ii  The Law is based on a single commodity consumption mode  That is  a 
consumer consumes only one good at a time  This is an unrealistic assumption 
In real life  a consumer consumes more than one good at a time 
 iii  According to the Law  a consumer should consume successive units of the 
same good continuously  In real life it is not so 
 iv  The Law assumes constancy of the marginal utility of money  This means the 
marginal utility of money remains constant  even when money stock changes 
In real life  the marginal utility derived from the consumption of a good cannot 
be measured precisely in monetary terms 
 v  As utility itself is capable of varying from person to person  marginal utility 
derived from the consumption of a good cannot be measured precisely 
LAW OF EQUI-MARGINAL UTILITY 
The idea of equi-marginal principle was first mentioned by H H Gossen  - 
  of Germany  Hence it is called Gossen s second Law  Alfred Marshall made 
significant refinements of this law in his  Principles of Economics 
The law of equi-marginal utility explains the behaviour of a consumer when 
he consumes more than one commodity  Wants are unlimited but the income which 
is available to the consumers to satisfy all his wants is limited  This law explains how 
the consumer spends his limited income on various commodities to get maximum 
satisfaction  The law of equi-marginal utility is also known as the law of substitution or 
the law of maximum satisfaction or the principle of proportionality between prices and 
marginal utility 
Definition 
In the words of Prof  Marshall   If a person has a thing which can be put to 
several uses  he will distribute it among these uses in such a way that it has the 
same marginal utility in all 
Assumptions 
  The consumer is rational so he wants to get maximum satisfaction 
  The utility of each commodity is measurable 
  The marginal utility of money remains constant 
  The income of the consumer is given 
  The prices of the commodities are given 
  The law is based on the law of diminishing marginal utility 
 
Explanation of the law 
Suppose there are two goods X and Y on which a consumer has to spend a 
given income  The consumer being rational  he will try to spend his limited income 
on goods X and Y to maximise his total utility or satisfaction  Only at that point the 
consumer will be in equilibrium 
According to the law of equi-marginal utility  the consumer will be in equilibrium 
at the point where the utility derived from the last rupee spent on each is equal 
Symbolically the consumer will be in equilibrium when 
Where MUx   Marginal utility of commodity X 
 MU 
y   Marginal utility of commodity Y 
 Px   Price of commodity X 
 P 
y   Price of commodity Y 
 MUm   Marginal utility of money 
They explain the marginal utility of one rupee spent on commodity X and the 
marginal utility of one rupee spent on commodity Y 
Let us illustrate the law of equi marginal utility with the help of the following 
table

Suppose the marginal utility of money is constant at Re       units  the 
consumer will buy   units of commodity  x  and   units of commodity  y  His total 
expenditure will be  Rs   x      Rs   x       Rs  - on both commodities  At this 
point of expenditure his satisfaction is maximised and therefore he will be in 
equilibrium

Consumer s equilibrium is graphically portrayed in fig    Since marginal 
utility curves of goods slope downward  curves depicting will also 
slope downward  Taking the income of a consumer as given  let his marginal utility of 
money be constant at OM utils in Fig    is equal to OM  the marginal utility 
of money  when OH amount of good x is purchased  is equal to OM when OK 
quantity of good Y is purchased  Thus  when the consumer is buying OH of X and 
OK of Y  then 
Therefore  the consumer will be in equilibrium when he buys OH of X and 
OK of Y  No other allocation of money expenditure will yield greater utility than when 
he buys OH of X and OK of Y  Suppose the money income of the consumer falls 
Then the new marginal utility of money will be equal to OM  then the consumer will 
increase the purchases of good X and Y to OH and OK respectively 
Limitations of the Law 
The law of equi-marginal utility bristles with the following difficulties 
  Indivisibility of Goods 
The theory is weakened by the fact that many commodities like a car  a house 
etc  are indivisible  In the case of indivisible goods  the law is not applicable 
  The Marginal Utility of Money is Not Constant 
The theory is based on the assumption that the marginal utility of money is 
constant  But that is not really so 
  The Measurement of Utility is not Possible 
Marshall states that the price a consumer is willing to pay for a commodity is 
equal to its marginal utility  But modern economists argue that  if two persons are 
paying an equal price for given commodity  it does not mean that both are getting the 
same level of utility  Thus utility is a subjective concept  which cannot be measured 
in quantitative terms 
  Utilities are Interdependent 
This law assumes that commodities are independent and therefore their 
marginal utilities are also independent  But in real life commodities are either 
substitutes or complements  Their utilities are therefore interdependent   
 
  Indefinite Budget Period 
According to Prof  K E  Boulding  indefinite budget period is another difficulty 
in the law  Normally the budget period is assumed to be a year  But there are certain 
commodities which are available in several succeeding accounting periods  It is 
difficult to calculate marginal utility for such commodities 
In conclusion  we may say all prudent and rational persons are expected to act 
upon the law consciously or unconsciously  As Chapman puts it 
 We are not  of course compelled to distribute our incomes according to the 
law of substitution or equi-marginal expenditure  as a stone thrown into the air is 
compelled  in a sense to fall back to the earth  but as a matter of fact  we do in a 
certain rough fashion  because we are reasonable 
Importance 
According to Marshall   the applications of this principle extend over almost 
every field of economic activity 
  It applies to consumption 
Every rational human being wants to get maximum satisfaction with his 
limited means  The consumer arranges his expenditure in such a way that 
 so that he will get maximum satisfaction 
  It applies to production 
The aim of the producer is to get maximum output with least-cost  so that his 
profit will be maximum  Towards this end  he will substitute one factor for another till

  Distribution of Earnings Between Savings and Consumption 
According to Marshall  a prudent person will endeavour to distribute his 
resources between his present needs and future needs in such a way that the 
marginal utility of the last rupee put in savings is equal to the marginal utility of the 
last rupee spent on consumption 
  It applies to distribution 
The general theory of distribution involves the principle of substitution  In 
distribution  the rewards to the various factors of production  that is their relative 
shares  are determined by the principle of equi-marginal utility 
 
  It Applies to Public Finance 
The principle of  Maximum Social Advantage  as enunciated by Professors 
Hicks and Dalton states that  the revenue should be distributed in such a way that the 
last unit of expenditure on various programmes brings equal welfare  so that social 
welfare is maximised 
  Expenditure of Time 
Prof  Boulding relates Marshall s law of equi-marginal utility to the 
expenditures of limited time  i e  twenty-four hours  He states that a person should 
spend his limited time among alternative uses such as reading  studying and 
gardening  in such a way that the marginal utility from all these uses are equal 
Consumer s surplus 
The concept of consumer s surplus was first mentioned by J A Dupuit  a 
French engineer   economist in   Marshall developed the concept in his work 
 Principles of Economics   
Consumer s surplus is experienced in commodities which are highly useful 
but relatively cheap  For example  newspaper  salt  match box  postage stamp etc 
For these commodities  we are ready to pay more than what we actually pay  if the 
alternative is to go without them  The extra satisfaction a consumer derives is called 
consumer s surplus  Suppose a consumer wants to buys a shirt  He is willing to pay 
Rs   for it  But the actual price is only Rs   Thus he enjoys a surplus of Rs  
This is called consumer s surplus 
Definition 
Marshall defines Consumer s surplus as follows 
 The excess of price which a person would be willing to pay rather 
than go without the thing  over that which he actually does pay  is the 
economic measure of this surplus of satisfaction  It may be called 
consumer s surplus 
Assumptions 
  Cardinal utility  that is  utility of a commodity is measured in money terms 
  Marshall assumes that there is definite relationship between expected satisfaction 
 utility  and realized satisfaction  actual 
  Marginal utility of money is constant 
  Absence of differences in income  tastes  fashion etc 
  Independent goods and independent utilities 
 
  Demand for a commodity depends on its price alone  it excludes other 
determinants of demand 
Measurement 
Consumer s Surplus for a single commodity is measured as follows 
Consumer s surplus   Potential price   Actual price 
Potential price is the price which a consumer is willing to pay for a commodity 
and actual price is the price which the consumer actually pays for that commodity 
Table

Consumer s surplus is determined by the potential price of the commodity 
purchased and the actual price in the market price  Thus the consumer s surplus is 
the difference between the sum of marginal utilities  i e  the total utility  minus the 
total money spent  price multiplied by quantity purchased  on the commodity  This 
can be illustrated by a table 
In the above table  we have assumed that the market price of the commodity 
is Rs -  column   Column   gives the marginal utility  Marginal utility explains 
the price which a consumer is willing to pay for the unit of the commodity  As more 
and more units of a commodity is purchased  the marginal utility declines  Therefore 
the price  which the consumer is willing to pay  also decreases  The difference 
between marginal utility  potential price  and the market price  actual price  gives 
the consumer s surplus  Thus from the table consumer s surplus for each unit is 
the difference between Marginal Utility  column   minus market price  column  
The consumer s surplus for all the units can be calculated as total utility minus the 
total amount spent on the commodity i e  consumer s surplus   Rs         Rs 
  Consumer s surplus can be illustrated with a diagram by taking units of the 
commodity on the x-axis and the utility and price on the y-axis

A rise in the market price reduces consumer s surplus  A fall in the market

Criticism 
Two major criticisms against the Marshallian concept of Consumer s Surplus 
are 
 a  Marshall assumed that utility is measurable  but utility is immeasurable 
because it is psychological in nature 
 b  The Marshallian assumption of marginal utility of money remaining constant is 
unrealistic 
This contribution of the great economist Marshall  has perhaps provoked the 
most caustic of criticisms from various economists 
Marshall assumed that utility is measurable  But J R Hicks says that utility is 
not measurable  because it is a psychological phenomenon 
  Marshall assumed that there s no interpersonal differences  But it will change 
with regard to tastes  preferences  status etc 
  Marshall assumed that there is constancy of marginal utility of money  But it 
is unrealistic  Marginal utility of money increases with the fall in the stock of 
money 
 
Importance of Consumer s Surplus 
Consumer s Surplus is useful to the Finance Minister in formulating taxation 
policies  It is also helpful in fixing a higher price by a monopolist in the market  based 
on the extent of consumer s surplus enjoyed by consumers 
Consumer s Surplus enables comparison of the standard of living of people 
of different regions or countries  This comparison helps to distinguish consumption 
levels between the people  who are living in rich countries and poor countries  For 
example  a middleclass person in New York enjoys more consumers  surplus than a 
similar person in Chennai  Alfred Marshall has stated that a middle class person in a 
modern city enjoys more consumer s surplus than a king of the Medieval Ages 
Indifference Curve Approach 
Marshall s demand analysis is based on the cardinal measurement of utility 
The approach is criticised for two reasons 
 i  Utility is a psychological phenomenon and 
 ii  It cannot be measured 
Hence  the indifference curve approach based on ordinal ranking preference 
was evolved  Vilfred Pareto  Wicksteed and Slutsky developed this approach  Two 
noted English economists Prof  J R  Hicks and Prof  Allen provided a refined version 
of indifference curve approach  According to Hicks and Allen  utility cannot be 
measured  It can only be ranked or ordered  The consumer can rank his preference 
very easily and say which is better than the other 
The concept of scale of preference has been explained by indifference curve 
An indifference curve shows different combinations of two commodities  which give 
the consumer an equal satisfaction 
Definition 
An indifference curve is the locus of different combinations of two commodities 
giving the same level of satisfaction 
Assumptions of indifference curve analysis 
  The consumer is rational  So  he prefers more goods to less goods 
  He purchases two goods  X and Y only 
  The price that a consumer pays for a commodity indicates the level of utility 
derived by him 
  His income remains constant 
  His tastes  Preference   habits remain unchanged 
 
Indifference schedule 
An indifference schedule is a statement of various combinations of 
two commodities that will equally be accepted by the consumer  The various 
combinations give equal satisfaction to the consumer  Therefore he is indifferent 
between various combinations 
Let us assume that the consumer buys two commodities - bananas and 
biscuits  Then the indifference schudule will be 
Table   Indifference Schedule 
Combination Biscuits  Good X  Bananas  Good Y 
A    
B    
C    
D    
E    
From the above schedule it can be understood that while the number of 
biscuits is increasing  the number of bananas is decreasing so that the level 
of satisfaction is the same for all the combinations  Therefore the consumer is 
indifferent between the combinations A  B  C  D and E 
Indifference curve 
The data in the indifference schedule can be represented in the graph with 
one commodity on the X-axis and another commodity in the Y-axis The various 
combinations of the two commodities are plotted and joined to form a curve called 
indifference curve  In the figure IC is an indifference curve showing combinations of 
the two commodities given in the schedule

O X

Bananas 
Biscuits 
Figure  
Indifference Curve 
All the points on this curve give equal level of satisfaction to the consumer 
Indifference curve is otherwise called  iso  utility curve 
 
Indifference Map 
Indifference Map is a group of indifference curves for two commodities 
showing different levels of satisfaction  In this indifference map  it should be clearly 
understood that a higher indifference curve denotes higher level of satisfaction and 
a lower indifference curve represents lower level of satisfaction  Being rational 
the consumer will always choose a higher indifference curve to get maximum 
satisfaction  other things being equal 
Properties of an Indifference curve 
  Indifference curves slope downwards to the right 
  Indifference curves are convex to the origin 
  No two indifference curves can ever cut each other 
All indifference curves slope downwards from left to right 
The downward slope of indifference curve must be attributed to the fact 
that the consumer is substituting good X by good Y  increases the amount of Y 
and reduces the amount of X  If the indifference curve were horizontal line running 
parallel to X axis then the combination which it represents is the same amount of 
Y but more and more of X  In that case  the satisfaction from the combination will 
not be equal  For the same reason  it can be said that indifference curve will not be 
vertical 
All indifference curves are convex to the origin 
This is because of the operation of a principle known as  Diminishing Marginal 
Rate of Substitution  The indifference curves are based on this principle  If they are 
concave to the origin  then it will mean that MRS is increasing  Indifference curve 
cannot be straight line except when the goods are perfect substitutes 
 
Marginal rate of substitution between X and Y referes to the amount of 
commodity Y to be offered in exchange for one unit of X commodity  The MRS goes 
on diminishing as consumer goes on substituting X for Y 
The third assumption is that no two indifference curves can ever cut each 
other  But in Figure   we find two indifference curves do cut each other 
Point A which is on indifference curve   represents a higher level of 
satisfaction to the consumer than at point B which is on indifference curve   But 
point C lies on both curves  That means  two levels of satisfaction A and B which are 
unequal have become equal  That cannot be accepted  So indifference curves can 
never cut each other 
These are the three assumptions about the shape of an indifference curve 
 
Consumer s Equilibrium through Indifference Curve Analysis 
As a consumer has a limited income  he spends it in such a manner so as 
to obtain maximum level of satisfaction  He will attain equilibrium when he gets 
maximum satisfaction from his expenditure on different goods  Under the utility 
analysis explained earlier  a consumer gets maximum satisfaction when marginal 
utilities from his different purchases are equal  We can also explain the equilibrium 
of the consumer with the help of the indifference curve analysis  For our analysis  we 
have to make the following assumptions 
 a  The consumer has before him an indifference map for a pair of goods say  tea 
and biscuits  This map represents the preferences of the consumer for the two 
goods  It is assumed that his scales of preferences remain constant at a given 
time 
 b  The consumer has a fixed amount of money to spend on the two goods  It is 
assumed that he will spend the amount on both the goods and not save any 
part of it 
 c  The prices of these goods are given in the market and are assumed to be 
constant 
 d  The consumer is assumed to act rationally and maximise his satisfaction 
A consumer s indifference map for good X and good Y is given in figure   it 
represents four scales of preferences of a consumer for the two goods  Indifference 
curves to the right represent higher satisfaction  The consumer would like to choose 
a combination of good X and good Y  which will be on the highest indifference curve 
But his choice will depend upon his income and the price of the two goods 
To understand the extent of purchase of the goods with the given prices and 
income of the consumer  budget line is important 
Budget line of the consumer 
Suppose that the consumer has Rs  to spend on tea and biscuits  which 
cost   paise and   paise respectively  The consumer has three alternative 
possibilities before him 
 a  He may decide to buy tea only  in which case he can buy   cups of tea 
 b  He may decide to buy biscuits only  in which case he can buy   biscuits 
 c  He may decide to buy some quantity of both the goods  say   cups of tea 
 Rs  and   biscuits  Rs  or   cups of tea  Rs  and   biscuits  Rs 
and so on   Total amount   Rs 
 
Figure   shows the above three possibilities  The line LM represents 
maximum amount of biscuits   and to tea   cups  which the consumer can buy 
with his income of Rs  The line LM shows that the consumer cannot choose any 
combination beyond this line because his income does not permit him  Nor would 
he like to choose a combination below this line  say  B  as it will not represent the 
maximum satisfaction 
Line LM is known as the budget line since it represents the various amounts 
the consumer can buy with his income  it is also known as the price-ratio line or 
simply the price line since its slope represents the ratio of prices of the two goods 
 i e  OM of Good X   OL of good Y 
Figure     Consumer s Equilibrium 
The consumer gets the maximum possible satisfaction from his given income 
at point C on the indifference curve I 
  At this point  he buys a combination of OX 
amount of Good X and OY 
 amount of Good Y  Any other possible combination of the 
two goods will either yield lesser satisfaction or will not be unobtainable at present 
prices  with the given amount of income of the consumer 
 
At the point of equilibrium  point C  the price-line LM is tangential to the 
indifference curve I 
   At point C  the indifference curve and the price-line have the 
same slope Now the slope of the indifference curve represents the marginal rate of 
substitution  and the budget line shows the ratio of prices between the two goods 
At point C the marginal rate of substitution between the two goods as indicated by 
the slope of the indifference curve I 
 and the ratio of prices between the two goods 
as indicated by the price-line LM are equal  This point  therefore  indicates the 
ideal combination between the two commodities  giving the consumer the highest 
satisfaction possible with his limited income  At this point  therefore the consumer is 
in equilibrium 
The fundamental condition of equilibrium is that the marginal rate of 
substitution of commodity X for commodity Y should be equal to the ratio of prices 
between the two goods  Therefore  the condition for equilibrium is MRS

Chapter  
Demand and Supply 
Demand for a commodity refers to the desire backed by ability to pay and 
willingness to buy it  If a person below poverty line wants to buy a car  it is only a 
desire but not a demand as he cannot pay for the car  If a rich man wants to buy 
a car  it is demand as he will be able to pay for the car  Thus  desire backed by 
purchasing power is demand 
The demand for any commodity mainly depends on the price of that 
commodity  The other determinants include price of related commodities  the income 
of consumers  tastes and preferences of consumers  and the wealth of consumers 
Hence the demand function can be written as 
Dx   F  Px 
  Ps 
  Y  T  W 
where Dx 
 represents demand for good x 
Px is price of good X 
Ps 
 is price of related goods 
Y is income 
T refers to tastes and preferences of the consumers 
W refers to wealth of the consumer 
Law of Demand 
The law of demand states that there is a negative or inverse relationship 
between the price and quantity demanded of a commodity over a period of time 
Definition  Alfred Marshall stated that   the greater the amount sold  the 
smaller must be the price at which it is offered  in order that it may find purchasers 
or in other words  the amount demanded increases with a fall in price and diminishes 
with rise in price  According to Ferguson  the law of demand is that the quantity 
demanded varies inversely with price 
Thus the law of demand states that people will buy more at lower prices and 
buy less at higher prices  other things remaining the same  By other things remaining 
the same  we mean the following assumptions 
Assumptions of the Law 
  No change in the consumer s income 
  No change in consumer s tastes and preferences 
  No changes in the prices of other goods 
 
  No new substitutes for the goods have been discovered 
  People do not feel that the present fall in price is a prelude to a further decline in 
price 
Demand Schedule 
Demand schedule is a tabular statement showing how much of a commodity is 
demanded at different prices 
Demand Schedule and Demand curve 
Table   is a hypothetical demand schedule of an individual consumer  It 
shows a list of prices and corresponding quantities demanded by an individual 
consumer  This is an individual demand schedule 
 Table   Demand 
 Schedule 
Price 
 Rs 
Quantity Demanded 
 Units 
   
   
   
   
   
Demand Curve 
The demand schedule can be converted into a demand curve by measuring 
price on vertical axis and quantity on horizontal axis as shown in Figure  
In Figure    DD 
 is the demand curve  The curve slopes downwards from 
left to right showing that  when price rises  less is demanded and vice versa  Thus 
the demand curve represents the inverse relationship between the price and quantity 
demanded  other things remaining constant 
Why does the demand curve slope downwards 
The demand curve slopes downwards mainly due to the law of diminishing 
marginal utility  The law of diminishing marginal utility states that an additional unit of 
a commodity gives a lesser satisfaction  Therefore  the consumer will buy more only 
at a lower price  The demand curve slopes downwards because the marginal utility 
curve also slopes downwards 
 
Individual demand and market demand schedules 
Individual demand schedule tells the quantities demanded by an individual 
consumer at different prices 
Table     Individual demand schedule for oranges 
Price of oranges  Rs  Quantity of oranges 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It is clear from the schedule that when the price of orange is Rs  - the 
consumer demands just one orange  When the price falls to Rs  he demands  
oranges  When the price fals further to Rs   he demands   oranges  Thus  when the 
price of a commodity falls  the demand for that commodity increases and vice versa 
Market demand schedule 
A demand schedule for a market can be constructed by adding up demand 
schedules of the individual consumers in the market  Suppose that the market for 
oranges consists of   consumers  The market demand is calculated as follows

The Law of demand is a general statement telling that prices and quantities 
of a commodity are inversely related  There are certain peculiar cases in which the 
law of demand will not hold good  In those cases  more will be demanded at a higher 
price and less will be demanded at a lower price  The demand curves in those cases 
slope upwards showing a positive relationship between price and quantity demanded 
as shown in figure

When the price increases from OP to OP 
  quantity demanded also increases 
from OQ to OQ  and vice versa  DD is the exceptional or abnormal demand curve 
The following is the list of few exceptions to the law of demand 
  Veblen Effect 
Veblen has pointed out that there are some goods demanded by very rich 
people for their social prestige  When price of such goods rise  their use becomes 
more attractive and they are purchased in larger quantities  Demand for diamonds 
from the richer class will go up if there is increase in price  If such goods were 
cheaper  the rich would not even purchase 
 
  Giffen Paradox 
Sir Robert Giffen discovered that the poor people will demand more of inferior 
goods if their prices rise and demand less if their prices fall  Inferior goods are 
those goods which people buy in large quantities when they are poor and in small 
quantities when they become rich  For example  poor people spend the major part of 
their income on coarse grains  e g  ragi  cholam   and only a small part on rice  When 
the price of coarse grains rises  they will buy less rice  To fill up the resulting gap 
more of coarse grains have to be purchased  Thus  rise in the price of coarse grains 
results in the increase in quantity of coarse grains purchased  This is called  Giffen 
Paradox  In these cases  the law of demand has an exception 
Changes in demand 
Extension and contraction of demand 
The demand curve does not change its position here  When change in 
demand for a commodity is entirely due to a change in its price  it is called extension 
or contraction of demand  The extension or contraction in demand are movements on 
or along the given demand curve  It is shown in figure

When the price of a good is OP  demand is OQ  If the price of good falls 
to OP 
  demand expands to OQ 
  Thus extension in demand is QQ 
   On the 
other hand  when the price of good rises to OP 
 demand contracts to OQ 
  Thus 
contraction in demand is QQ 
 
Shifts in demand or Increase and decrease in demand 
One of the basic assumptions of economic theory is  other things being equal 
Other things are income  tastes  population  government policy  technology  price of 
related goods etc  Change in such factors will bring about increase or decrease in 
demand  In figure   the increase in demand is shown by the shifts of the demand  
 
curve to the right from DD to D

Factors determining demand 
  Tastes and preferences of the consumer 
Demand for a commodity may change due to a change in tastes  preferences 
and fashion  For example  the demand for dhoties has come down and demand for 
trouser cloth and jeans has gone up due to change in fashion 
  Income of the consumer 
When the income of the consumer increases  more will be demanded 
Therefore  we can say that as income increases  other things being equal  the 
demand for a commodity also increases  Comforts and luxuries belong to this 
category 
  Price of substitutes 
Some goods can be substituted for other goods  For example  tea and coffee 
are substitutes  If the price of coffee increases while the price of tea remains the 
same  there will be increase in the demand for tea and decrease in the demand for 
coffee  The demand for substitutes moves in the opposite direction 
  Number of consumers 
Size of population of a country is an important determinant of demand  For 
instance  larger the population  more will be the demand  for certain goods like food 
grains  and pulses etc  When the number of consumers increases  there will be 
greater demand for goods 
 
  Expectation of future price change 
If the consumer believes that the price of a commodity will rise in the future 
he may buy a larger quantity in the present  Suppose he expects the price to fall  he 
may defer some of his purchases to a future date 
  Distribution of income 
Distribution of income affects consumption pattern and hence the demand 
for various goods  If the government attempts redistribution of income to make it 
equitable  the demand for luxuries will decline and the demand for necessities of life 
will increase 
  Climate and weather conditions 
Demand for a commodity may change due to a change in climatic conditions 
For example  during summer  demand for cool drinks  cotton clothes and air 
conditioners will increase  In winter  demand for woollen clothes increases 
  State of business 
During boom  demand will expand and during depression demand will 
contract 
  Consumer Innovativeness 
When the price of wheat flour or price of electricity falls  the consumer 
identifies new uses for the product  It creates new demand for the product 
Elasticity of Demand 
The law of demand explains that demand will change due to a change in the 
price of the commodity  But it does not explain the rate at which demand changes to 
a change in price  The concept of elasticity of demand measures the rate of change 
in demand 
The concept of elasticity of demand was introduced by Alfred Marshall 
According to him  the elasticity  or responsiveness  of demand in a market is great or 
small according as the amount demanded increases much or little for a given fall in 
price  and diminishes much or little for a given rise in price 
Types of Elasticity of Demand 
There are three types of elasticity of demand 
  Price elasticity of demand 
  Income elasticity of demand  and 
  Cross-elasticity of demand 
 
  Price elasticity of demand 
 The degree of responsiveness of quantity demanded to a change in price is 
called price elasticity of demand

Measurement of price elasticity of demand 
Important methods for calculating price elasticity of demand are 
  Percentage method 
  Point method or slope method 
  Total outlay method 
  Arc method 
  Percentage method 
This is measured as the relative change in demand divided by relative change 
in price  or  percentage change in demand divided by percentage change in price 
  q Formula is e 
p      p 
For example  the price of rice rises by   and the demand for rice falls by  
Then ep        
This means that the demand for rice is elastic 
If the demand falls to   for a   rise in price  then ep         This 
means that the demand for rice is inelastic  Thus there are five measures of elasticity 
a  Relatively Elastic demand  if the value of elasticity is greater than  
b  Relatively Inelastic demand  if the value of elasticity is less than  
c  Unitary elastic demand  if the value of elasticity is equal to  
d  Perfectly inelastic demand  if the value of elasticity is zero 
e  Perfectly elastic demand  if the value of elasticity is infinity

  Total outlay method 
We can measure elasticity through a change in expenditure on commodities 
due to a change in price 
  Demand is elastic  if total outlay or expenditure increases for a fall in price  ep 
  
 
  Demand is inelastic  if total outlay or expenditure falls for a fall in price  ep 
    
  Elasticity of demand is unitary  if total expenditure does not change for a fall in

Cross-elasticity of demand 
The responsiveness of demand to changes in prices of related goods is called 
cross-elasticity of demand  related goods may be substitutes or complementary 
goods  In other words  it is the responsiveness of demand for commodity x to the 
change in the price of commodity y 
The relationship between x and y commodities may be substitutive as in the 
case of tea and coffee  or  complementary as in the case of pen and ink  
 
Measures of cross-elasticity of demand 
Infinity - Commodity x is nearly a perfect substitute for commodity y 
Zero - Commodities x and y are not related 
Negative - Commodities x and y are complementary 
Factors determining elasticity of demand  The elasticity of demand depends on 
  nature of the commodity    uses of commodity    existence of substitutes   
postponement of demand    amount of money spent    habits and   range of prices 
of commodity 
Importance of Elasticity of demand 
  Price discrimination 
If the demand for a product has different elasticities in different markets  then 
the monopolist can fix different prices in different markets  This price discrimination is 
possible due to different price elasticities 
  Levy of taxes 
The government will get higher revenue if tax is increased on goods having 
inelastic demand  Conversely  the government  will get lower revenue if tax is 
increased on goods having elastic demand 
  International Trade 
Terms of trade refer to the rate at which domestic commodities are exchanged 
for foreign commodities  The terms of trade will be favourable to a country if its 
exports enjoy inelastic demand in the world market 
  Determination of volume of output 
Volume of goods and services must be produced in accordance with the 
demand for the commodity  When the demand is inelastic  the producer will produce 
more goods to take the advantage of higher prices  Hence the nature of elastic and 
inelastic demand helps in the determination of the volume of output 
  Fixation of wages for labourers 
If the demand for workers is inelastic  efforts of trade unions to raise wages of 
the workers will be successful  On the other hand  if the demand for labour is elastic 
they may not succeed in increasing the wage rate by trade union activity 
  Poverty in the midst of plenty 
The concept of elasticity of demand explains the paradox of poverty i e  poverty in 
the midst of plenty  For example  bumper crop of food grains should bring agricultural 
prosperity but if the demand for food grains is inelastic  the agriculturist will be the 
loser if low price is paid 
 
LAW OF SUPPLY 
Supply means the goods offered for sale at a price during a specific period of 
time  It is the capacity and intention of the producers to produce goods and services 
for sale at a specific price 
The supply of a commodity at a given price may be defined as the amount of it 
which is actually offered for sale per unit of time at that price 
The law of supply establishes a direct relationship between price and supply 
Firms will supply less at lower prices and more at higher prices   Other things 
remaining the same  as the price of commodity rises  its supply expands and as the 
price falls  its supply contracts 
Supply schedule and supply curve 
A supply schedule is a statement of the various quantities of a given 
commodity offered for sale at various prices per unit of time  With the help of the 
supply schedule  a supply curve can be drawn 
Individual supply schedule and curve 
Individual supply schedule is a list of prices and quantities of a given 
commodity offered for sale by an individual seller or producer 
Table   Supply Schedule of A 
Price  in Rs  quantity 
supplied 
in dozens 
   
   
   
   
With the help of the supply schedule  we can construct supply curve  On the 
basis of the schedule  supply curve SS is drawn  It has a positive slope  It moves 
upward to the right  The price of the product and quantity supplied are directly related 
to each other 
Market supply schedule and curve 
By adding up the quantity supplied at various prices by all sellers in the 
market  we can get market supply schedule 
Market supply curve is the lateral summation of the individual supply curves of 
all the producers in the market

Movement along the supply curve or expansion and contraction of

When more units are supplied at a higher price  it is called  expansion of 
supply  When fewer units are supplied at a lower price it is called  contraction in 
supply  It is illustrated in figure

supply

 the 
producer will supply OC units  The supply has contracted from OA to OC 
Shifts in supply  or  increase or decrease in supply 
Increase or decrease in supply causes shifts in the supply curve  A shift in 
the supply curve is due to a change in other factors i e  other than the price of the 
commodity  It is explained in the figure

Factors determining supply 
  Production technology 
State of production technology affects the supply function  If advanced 
technology is used in the country  large scale production is possible  Hence supply 
will increase  Old technology will not increase the supply 
  Prices of factors 
When the prices of factors rise  cost of production will increase  This will result 
in a decrease in supply 
  Prices of other products 
Any change in the prices of other products will influence the supply  An 
increase in the price of other products will influence the producer to shift the 
production in favour of that product  Supply of the original product will be reduced 
  Number of producers or firms 
If the number of producers producing the product increases  the supply of the 
product will increase in the market 
  Future price expectations 
If producers expect that there will be a rise in the prices of products in future 
they will not supply their products at present 
  Taxes and subsidies 
If tax is imposed by the government on the inputs of a commodity  cost of 
production will go up  Supply will be reduced  When subsidy is given to the producer 
it will encourage them to produce and supply more  Subsidy means a part of the cost 
of a commodity will be borne by the government 
  Non-economic factors 
Non-economic factors like  war  political climate and natural calamities create 
scarcity in supply 
Elasticity of Supply 
The law of supply tells us that quantity supplied will respond to a change in 
price  The concept of elasticity of supply explains the rate of change in supply as a 
result of change in price  It is measured by the formula mentioned below 
 
Elasticity of supply may be defined as  the degree of responsiveness of 
change in supply to change in price on the part of sellers 
Types of elasticity of supply 
There are five types of elasticity of supply 
  Perfectly elastic supply 
The coefficient of elasticity of supply is infinity   es 
 is   For a small change or 
no change in price  there will be infinite amount of supply   SS

  Relatively elastic supply 
The coefficient of elastic supply is greater than  es 
     Quantity supplied

  Unitary elastic supply

Chapter  
Equilibrium Price 
We have discussed in the last chapter demand and supply  The demand curve 
reflects the price-quantity relationship and exhibits the different pairs of price-quantity 
preferred by the consumers  Similarly the supply curve exhibits the preferences of 
firms for different pairs of price-quantity  The preferences of consumers  buyers  and 
firms  sellers  are opposed to each other  It is also evident enough from the shape of 
demand and supply curves  What will be the actual price charged and quantity sold in 
a particular market 
There is only one price at which the preferences of sellers and buyers 
meet together  At that point the quantity demanded of a commodity by the buyer 
is equivalent to the quantity the seller is willing to sell  This price is called as the 
equilibrium price and it occurs at the point of intersection of the supply curve and the 
demand curve  In other words  equilibrium refers to a particular pair of prices and 
quantity  The supply and the demand will be in balance in equilibrium 
Equilibrium in general is defined as the state of rest or balance from which 
there is no tendency for change  In economics  equilibrium normally refers to 
equilibrium in a market  Even if there is any change  the original equilibrium position 
will be restored by market forces  The concept of equilibrium is also applied to 
describe and understand other sub-systems of the economy like agriculture  industry 
growth and distribution

PE - equilibrium price   or price of market balance 
D S - Excess of demand - when P PE 
S D - Excess of supply - when P  PE 
Market equilibrium can also be illustrated with help of Figure   Equilibrium 
price is PE   At price PE   the quantity demanded is equal to quantity supplied  D S  At 
other prices  there is no equality between quantity demanded and quantity supplied 
In both the cases either the consumer or the firms are dissatisfied and tend to 
change the price 
At any price above the equilibrium price  PE  supply is greater than 
demand S D  Thus there is excess supply  When price is high  buyers prefer 
to reduce their purchase  But sellers prefer to sell more as price is high  These 
contrasting behaviours of buyers and sellers result in excess supply in the market 
which is the difference between the quantities demanded and quantity supplied  As 
sellers cannot sell all of the quantity at the high price  some of them may reduce price 
to sell the excess stocks 
For instance  price  discounts  are advertised by sellers in the name of  annual 
stock clearance  sales  When one seller offers discount  the other sellers also follow 
suit by cutting their prices  As a result  the market price as a whole will decline till the 
excess supply is sold and equilibrium is  D S  restored 
Similarly  if the price is below the equilibrium price PE  there will be excess 
demand  D S  In this case some of the buyers may try to bid up the price to buy 
some more quantity when supply is less  This may also encourage sellers to supply 
more  For instance  buying cinema tickets off the counter  called as tickets in black 
by paying a higher price than the actual price 
Thus  in both cases  the actions of buyers and sellers will move the price 
either upwards or downwards and eliminate the excess demand or excess 
supply  Such actions also restore the demand-supply balance to attain the market 
equilibrium  At equilibrium price  there is no force to change the price or quantity 
demanded of a commodity 
Figure   illustrates the market in equilibrium at the equality between demand 
and supply  In case of any deviation from the equilibrium price  the direction of price 
movement is shown by the arrow marks  When there is excess supply  price has a 
downward tendency  In the case of excess demand  price has an upward tendency 
At equilibrium  price is stable because there is no tendency for change as D S 
 
Shift in Demand and Supply 
The market equilibrium attained above is temporary  It cannot be retained for 
a long period  It is because demand and supply conditions keep changing frequently 
Such changes occur due to many variables other than price  These changes occur 
independently of price  We will see the causes and nature of such changes that 
influence demand and supply 
We have already seen that price is the main factor affecting demand and 
supply keeping  other things  constant  What are the  other things  Suppose  those 
 other things  are not constant but changing  what will happen to demand and supply 
Note that any change in these determinants of demand and supply will shift the 
demand curve and supply curve  These shifts will also bring new equilibrium 
Shift in Demand 
The  other things  that affect demand are also called as the determinants of 
demand  They include income of the consumer  tastes  prices of substitutes and 
many more  Changes in these determinants will change demand independently of 
price  If income of the consumer increases  they will buy more irrespective of the 
price  Similarly a fall in income will bring a fall in demand even if there is no change in 
price

In Figure   D is the original demand curve with equilibrium price P and 
quantity Q  Any change in the determinants of demand like income and tastes will 
shift the demand curve  For instance  a fall in the income of consumer shifts the 
demand curve D to D 
 and the new equilibrium would be at point E 
 Similarly  any 
increase in income shifts the demand curve from D to D 
   The equilibrium also 
moves from point E 
 to E 
    
 
Note the distinction between changes in quantity demanded and change 
in demand  Changes in quantity demanded occur only when there is change in the 
price  Thus the change in the price-quantity schedule brings movements on the 
demand curve whereas the changes in the other determinants  namely income 
tastes  prices of substitutes  etc  shift the demand curve as a whole

Shifts in Supply Curve 
Shifts in Supply 
As seen earlier  the supply curve shows the relationship between the price and 
quantity supplied keeping the  other things  constant  The  other things  which affect 
supply include number of sellers in the market  factor prices  etc  These factors affect 
quantity supplied independently of price 
Price is the major determinant of supply  However  a fall in the price of factor 
 s  of production  land and labour  will reduce the cost of production  This in turn will 
encourage the firms to supply more  This will cause the shift of supply curve from 
its original level of S to new level of S 
  On the other hand  an increase in factor 
price will increase the cost of production and the supply curve will shift from S to S 
 
In these two situations S 
 and S    equilibrium point also moves from E to E 
 or E 
respectively 
Just like demand  the distinction between the change in quantity supplied and 
change in supply needs to be noted  A change in the quantity supplied occurs only 
due to change in price whereas the change in the  determinants  of supply such as 
factor price will shift the entire supply curve and a new equilibrium will be attained 
Such shifts will take place independently of price   
 
Time Periods and Price Fixation 
Time Element 
Time element plays an important role in economics  Modern economists divide 
time periods into short period and long period  The equilibrium price acquired above 
is valid only for a particular time period  Any change in demand and supply over a 
period of time will shift the demand and supply curves and different equilibrium will be 
obtained 
For instance  the flexibility of a firm in adjusting its production to meet the 
change in demand depends on the nature of its inputs  There are two types of inputs 
namely fixed inputs and variable inputs 
The fixed input is one whose quantity cannot be adjusted in a limited time 
period  Heavy machinery  buildings and capital equipments are such fixed inputs and 
they may need more time for installation or replacement 
However  variable inputs like labour  raw materials and electricity can be 
changed quickly to change the supply until the full plant capacity is reached  Now it is 
possible to distinguish between short period and long period  The short period for a 
firm is the time period during which at least one of the inputs is fixed input  The long 
period is the time period during which all the inputs are variable inputs 
The specific duration of the short period and long period will vary from firm 
to firm  A small Bonda stall on the roadside pavements can change all the inputs 
even within a single day  because all inputs are easily variable  The seller can install 
one more stove  use more oil and other ingredients of Bonda within a day to meet 
any sudden increase in demand  Hence  for him the duration of long period can 
even be a single day  On the other hand  installation of a specialized machinery for 
the Ariyalur cement plant may take years  because the production  transportation 
installation require a long period of time 
Price Fixation in the Short Period 
Alfred Marshall introduced time element in the determination of equilibrium 
and divided them into market period  short period and long period 
Market Period 
Market period is the period during which the ability of the firms to affect any 
changes in supply in response to any change in demand is extremely limited or 
almost nil  Thus supply is more or less fixed in the market period without any change 
However  the demand may vary during this period 
The equilibrium price will be determined according to the changes in demand 
given the fixed supply  Figure   explains the equilibrium price in market period

Market Period 
As the supply is fixed in the market period  it is shown as a vertical line SMP 
It is also called as inelastic supply curve  When demand increases from DD to D 
D 
 
price increases from P to P 
  Similarly  a fall in demand from DD to D 
D 
 pull the 
price down from P to P 
  The market for perishables can be a good illustration  The 
demand for plantain fruits increases during the festival season  so the prices will 
naturally go up as the supply cannot be increased immediately to meet the demand 
Thus  demand determines the equilibrium price in the market period 
Short period 
As mentioned earlier short period is the one during which at least one of the 
factors will be a fixed input and the supply will be adjusted by changing the variable 
inputs  The equilibrium price will be determined by adjusting supply  within the plant 
capacity  according to the changes in demand  Figure

sp is elastic implying that supply can be increased by changing the variable 
input  Note that the corresponding increase in price from P to P 
 for a given increase 
in demand from D to D  is less than that of the market period  It is because  increase 
in demand is partially met by the increase in supply from q to q 
   Thus during 
the short period both demand and supply exert their influence on price and the 
equilibrium price is determined accordingly 
Long Period 
In the long period supply can be changed by changing all the inputs  both the 
fixed and variable inputs  Any amount of change in demand will be met by changing 
the supply  to the extent of changing the plant  machinery and the quantum of 
technology  In figure   the long period supply curve SLP is more elastic and flatter 
than that of the SSP  This implies the greater extent of flexibility of the firms to change 
the supply  The price increases from P to P 
 in response to an increase in demand 
from D to D  and it is less than that of the market period  P 
  and short period  P 
 
It is because the increase in demand is fully met by the required increase in supply 
Hence  supply plays a significant role in determining the lower equilibrium price in the 
long run

Chapter  
Production 
Meaning of Production 
Production in Economics refers to the creation of those goods and services 
which have exchange value  It means the creation of utilities  These utilities are in the 
nature of form utility  time utility and place utility  Creation of such utilities results in 
the overall increase in the production and redistribution of goods and services in the 
economy  Utility of a commodity may increase due to several reasons 
Form Utility 
If the physical form of a commodity is changed  its utility may increase  For 
instance  the utility of cotton increases  if it is converted into clothes  The other 
examples are processing of paddy into rice  wheat into flour and butter into ghee 
Place Utility 
If a commodity is transported from one place to another  its utility may 
increase  For instance  if rice is transported from Tamil Nadu to Kerala  its utility will 
be more 
Time Utility 
If the commodity is stored for future usage  its utility may increase  During 
rainy season  water is stored in reservoirs and it is used at a later time  This 
increases the utility of that stored water  Agricultural commodities like paddy  wheat 
oilseeds  pulses are stored for the regular uses of consumers throughout the year 
Possession Utility 
Commodities in the transaction process  change from one person to another 
person  Commodities in the hands of producers have some utility and by the time 
they reach consumers through the traders their utility is increased  Such utility due to 
possession or transfer of ownership of the commodity is called  possession utility  For 
example  paddy in the hands of producers  i e  farmers has less utility compared to 
that of the rice in the hands of consumers 
Factors of production 
Human activity can be broken down into two components  production and 
consumption  When there is production  a process of transformation takes place 
Inputs are converted into an output  The inputs are classified and referred to as land 
labour  and capital  Collectively the inputs are called factors of production 
When the factors of production are combined in order to produce something 
a fourth factor is required  Goods and services do not produce themselves but need  
 
some conscious thought process in order to plan and implement manufacture  This 
thought process is often called entrepreneurship or organisation 
Factors of production refer to those goods and services which help in the 
productive process 
Kinds of factors of production 
Factors of production are broadly classified into primary factors and derived 
factors  Man  Labour  acts upon Nature  Land  to produce goods and services and 
wealth  These two factors  Land and Labour  are naturally given and without them no 
goods can be produced  These are called primary factors 
Capital and organisation are derived from the primary factors of production 
and are called derived factors of production  These derived factors of production 
when combined with the primary factors of production  raise total production 
According to the traditional classification  there are four factors of production 
They are Land  Labour  Capital and Organisation 
Land 
Land as a factor of production refers to all those natural resources or gifts of 
nature which are provided free to man  It includes within itself several things such as 
land surface  air  water  minerals  forests  rivers  lakes  seas  mountains  climate and 
weather  Thus   Land  includes all things that are not made by man 
Characteristics or Peculiarities of land 
 i  Land is a free gift of nature 
 ii  Land is fixed  inelastic  in supply 
 iii  Land is imperishable 
 iv  Land is immobile 
 v  Land differs in fertility and situation 
 vi  Land is a passive factor of production 
As a gift of nature  the initial supply price of land is zero  However  when used 
in production  it becomes scarce  Therefore  it fetches a price  accordingly 
Labour 
Labour is the human input into the production process  Alferd Marshall defines 
labour as  the use or exertion of body or mind  partly or wholly  with a view to secure 
an income apart from the pleasure derived from the work 
 
Characteristics or Peculiarities of labour 
 i  Labour is perishable 
 ii  Labour is an active factor of production  Neither land nor capital can yield much 
without labour 
 iii  Labour is not homogeneous  Skill and dexterity vary from person to person 
 iv  Labour cannot be separated from the labourer 
 v  Labour is mobile  Man moves from one place to another from a low paid 
occupation to a high paid occupation 
 vi  Individual labour has only limited bargaining power  He cannot fight with his 
employer for a rise in wages or improvement in work- place conditions  However 
when workers combine to form trade unions  the bargaining power of labour 
increases 
Labour can assume several forms  Digging earth  breaking stones  carrying 
loads comprise simple labour operations but labour also covers highly qualified and 
skilled managers  engineers and technicians 
Division of Labour 
The concept  Division of Labour  was introduced by Adam Smith in his book 
 An Enquiry into The Nature and Causes of Wealth of Nations 
Meaning of Division of Labour 
Division of Labour means dividing the process of production into distinct and 
several component processes and assigning each component in the hands of a 
labour or a set of labourers  who are specialists in that particular process 
For example  a tailor stitches a shirt in full  In the case of garment exporters 
cutting of cloth  stitching of hands  body  collars  holes for buttons  stitching of 
buttons  etc  are done independently by different workers  Therefore  they are 
combining the parts into a whole shirt 
A tailor may stitch a maximum of four shirts a day  In the case of garment 
exports firm  it may stitch more than   shirts a day  Thus  division of labour results 
in increased production 
Division of Labour and Market 
It is stated  Division of Labour is limited by the extent of market  When 
markets for a commodity grows from local to national and national to international 
producers of that commodity divide and subdivide the processes of its production into 
finer and finer divisions of labour  Each sub-division is assigned to a particular set of 
specialist workers  As a result  production rises enormously 
 
Merits of Division of Labour 
  Division of labour improves efficiency of labour when labour repeats 
doing the same tasks 
  Facilitates the use of machinery in production  resulting in inventions  e g 
More s telegraphic codes 
  Time and materials are put to the best and most efficient use 
Demerits of Division of Labour 
The demerits of Division of Labour are 
  Repetition of the same task makes labour to feel that the work is monotonous 
and stale  It kills the humanity in him 
  Narrow specialisation reduces the possibility of labour to find alternative 
avenues of employment  This results in increased unemployment 
  Kills the growth of handicrafts and the worker loses the satisfaction of having 
made a commodity in full 
Capital 
Capital is the man made physical goods used to produce other goods and 
services  In the ordinary language  capital means money  In Economics  capital refers 
to that part of man-made wealth which is used for the further production of wealth 
According to Marshall   Capital consists of those kinds of wealth other than free gifts 
of nature  which yield income 
Money is regarded as capital because it can be used to buy raw materials 
tools  implements and machinery for production  The terms capital and wealth are not 
synonymous  Capital is that part of wealth which is used for the further production of 
wealth  Thus  all wealth is not capital but all capital is wealth 
Forms of Capital 
  Physical Capital or Material Resources 
  Money Capital or Monetary Resources  and 
  Human Capital or Human Resources 
  Physical Capital 
All man-made physical assets like plant and machinery  tools  buildings  roads 
dams and communication  etc  are the various forms of physical capital 
 
Characteristics of Physical capital 
 a  It is an asset which has a specific life period 
 b  Physical capital asset can be used in production again and again  As a result  it 
undergoes wear and tear or depreciation 
 c  When used in production  it gives a series of annual income flows called 
annuities  during its life period 
Accumulation of more and more physical capital is called physical capital formation 
  Money Capital 
The investment that is made in the form of money or monetary instruments 
is called money capital  A household saves its income in the form of bank deposits 
shares and securities or other monetary instruments  These are the sources of 
money capital 
  Human Capital 
Human capital refers to the quality of labour resources  which can be improved 
through investments in education  training  and health  Higher the investments in 
human capital  higher will be the productivity 
Characteristics of capital 
 i  Capital is a passive factor of production 
 ii  Capital is man-made 
 iii  Capital is not an indispensable factor of production  i e  Production is possible 
even without capital 
 iv  Capital has the highest mobility 
 v  Supply of capital is elastic 
 vi  Capital is productive 
 vii  Capital lasts over time  A plant may be in operation for a number of years 
 viii  Capital involves present sacrifice  cost  to get future benefits 
Organisation or entrepreneurship 
An entrepreneur is a person who combines the different factors of production 
 land  labour and capital  in the right proportion and initiates the process of 
production and also bears the risk involved in it  The entrepreneur is also called 
 organiser  Entrepreneurship is risk taking  managerial  and organizational skills 
needed to produce goods and services in order to gain a profit  In modern times  an 
entrepreneur is called  the changing agent of the society  He is not only responsible 
for producing the socially desirable output but also to increase the social welfare 
 
Functions of an Entrepreneur 
  Identifying Profitable Investible Opportunities 
Conceiving a new and most promising and profitable idea or capturing a 
new idea available in the market is the foremost function of an entrepreneur  This is 
known as identifying profitable investible opportunities 
  Deciding the size of unit of production 
An entrepreneur has to decide the size of the unit   whether big or small 
depending upon the nature of the product and the level of competition in the market 
  Deciding the location of the production unit 
A rational entrepreneur will always locate his unit of production nearer to both 
factor market and the end-use market  This is to be done in order to bring down 
the delay in production and distribution of products and to reduce the storage and 
transportation cost 
  Identifying the optimum combination of factors of production 
The entrepreneur  after having decided to start a new venture  takes up the 
task of hiring factors of production  Further  he decides in what combinations he 
should combine these factors so that maximum output is produced at minimum cost 
  Making innovations 
According to Schumpeter  basically an entrepreneur is an innovator of new 
markets and new techniques of production  A new market increases the sales volume 
whereas a new cost cutting production technique will make the product cheaper  This 
will in turn increase the volume of sales and the profit 
  Deciding the reward payment 
The factors used in production have to be rewarded on the basis of their 
productivity  Measuring the productivity of the factors and the payment of reward is 
the crucial function of an entrepreneur 
  Taking Risks and facing uncertainties 
According to Hawley  a business is nothing but a bundle of risks  Products are 
produced for future demand  The future is uncertain  The investments are made in 
the present  This is the serious risk in production  One who is ready to accept the risk 
becomes a successful entrepreneur  A prudent entrepreneur forecasts the future risks 
scientifically and take appropriate decision in the present to overcome such risks 
According to Knight one of the important functions of entrepreneur is uncertaintybearing 
 
Production Function 
The functional relationship between inputs and outputs is known as production 
function  Inputs refer to the factor services which are used in production i e  land 
labour  capital and enterprise  Output refers to the volume of goods produced 
Given technical conditions  the production function shows how a certain amount of 
inputs will result in the production of a certain amount of output of a commodity  The 
production function is given as 
Q   f  x 
  x 
  x  
 xn 
   in which 
Q is the quantity produced during a given period of time and x 
  x  x   xn 
are the quantities of different factors used in production  The production function 
explains how the output can be maximised with the help of given inputs 
To understand the different stages of the production functions  it is essential to 
understand the relationship between  i  Marginal Product and Total Product and  ii 
Marginal Product and Average Product  Refer Table   and Figure  
Relationship between Marginal Product and Total Product 
 i  When marginal product is positive  the total product increases 
a  When marginal product increases  the total product will be increasing at an 
increasing rate 
b  When marginal product remains constant  the total product will be increasing 
at a constant rate 
c  When marginal product decreases but is positive  the total product will be 
increasing at a decreasing rate 
 ii  When marginal product is zero  the total product reaches the maximum 
and remains constant 
 iii  When marginal product is negative  the total product decreases 
Production function may be classified into two 
  Short-run production function which is studied through Law of Variable 
Proportions 
  Long-run production function which is explained by Returns to Scale 
Short-run production function - The law of variable proportions 
The law examines the relationship between one variable factor and output 
keeping the quantities of other factors fixed 
 
Definition 
As the proportion of one factor in a combination of factors is increased  after a 
point  first the marginal and then the average product of that factor will diminish 
Assumptions of the law 
The law is based on the following assumptions 
 i  Only one factor is made variable and other factors are kept constant 
 ii  This law does not apply in case all factors are proportionately varied  i e 
where the factors must be used in rigidly fixed proportions to yield a product 
 iii  The variable factor units are homogenous i e  all the units of variable factors 
are of equal efficiency 
 iv  Input prices remain unchanged 
 v  The state of technology does not change or remains the same at a given 
point of time 
 vi  The entire operation is only for short-run  as in the long-run all inputs are 
variable 
Three stages of law 
The behaviour of the output when the varying quantity of one factor is 
combined with a fixed quantity of the other can be divided into three stages  They are

The three stages could be better understood by the following Table   and 
figure  
Stage I  Stage of increasing returns 
Stage I ends where the average product reaches its highest  maximum  point 
During this stage  the total product  the average product and the marginal product are 
increasing  It is notable that the marginal product in this stage increases but in a later 
part it starts declining  Though marginal product starts declining  it is greater than the 
average product so that the average product continues to rise 
Stage II  Stage of decreasing returns 
Stage II ends at the point where the marginal product is zero  In the second 
stage  the total product continues to increase but at a diminishing rate  The marginal 
product and the average product are declining but are positive  At the end of the 
second stage  the total product is maximum and the marginal product is zero 
Stage III  Stage of negative returns 
In this stage the marginal product becomes negative  The total product and 
the average product are declining 
The stage of Operation 
In stage I the fixed factor is too much in relation to the variable factor 
Therefore in stage I  marginal product of the fixed factor is negative  On the other 
hand  in stage III the marginal product of the variable factor is negative  Therefore a 
rational producer will not choose to produce in stages I and III  He will choose only  
 
the second stage to produce where the marginal product of both the fixed factor and 
variable factor are positive  At this stage the total product is maximum  The particular 
point at which the producer will decide to produce in this stage depends upon the 
prices of factors  The stage II represents the range of rational production decisions 
Long-run production function - Returns to Scale 
In the long run  all factors can be changed  Returns to scale studies the 
changes in output when all factors or inputs are changed  An increase in scale 
means that all inputs or factors are increased in the same proportion 
Three phases of returns to scale 
The changes in output as a result of changes in the scale can be studied in  
phases  They are 
 i  Increasing returns to scale 
 ii  Constant returns to scale 
 iii  Decreasing returns to scale 
Increasing returns to scale 
If the increase in all factors leads to a more than proportionate increase 
in output  it is called increasing returns to scale  For example  if all the inputs are 
increased by   the output increases by more than   i e  by   In this case the 
marginal product will be rising 
Constant returns to scale 
If we increase all the factors  i e  scale  in a given proportion  the output will 
increase in the same proportion i e  a   increase in all the factors will result in an 
equal proportion of   increase in the output  Here the marginal product is constant 
Decreasing returns to scale 
If the increase in all factors leads to a less than proportionate increase in 
output  it is called decreasing returns to scale i e  if all the factors are increased 
by   the output will increase by less than   i e  by   In this phase marginal 
product will be decreasing

imperfect elasticity of substitution

Production function through Iso-quants 
The isoquant analysis helps to understand how different combinations of two 
or more factors are used to produce a given level of output  Considering two factors 
of production   capital and labour  the following table   shows various combinations 
of capital and labour that help a firm to produce   units of a product

The two axes measure the quantities of labour and capital and the curve IQ 
shows the different combinations that produce   units of output  Each of the 
points R 
  R 
  R 
  R 
 and R 
 on the curve shows a capital-labour combination that 
can produce   units of output  Therefore the curve is known as an equal product 
curve or an iso- quant curve 
Thus an isoquant or isoproduct curve represents different combinations of two 
factors of production that yield the same level of output 
 
Characteristics of an isoquant 
  The isoquant is downward sloping from left to right i e  it is negatively sloped 
  An isoquant is convex to the origin because of the diminishing marginal 
rate of technical substitution  Marginal rate of technical substitution of factor 
X  capital  for factor Y  labour  may be defined as the amount of factor Y 
 labour  which can be replaced by one unit of factor X  capital  the level of 
output remaining unchanged

Thus the marginal rate of technical substitution is always declining  Hence 
the isoquant is always convex to the origin  The slope of the isoquant represents 
marginal rate of technical substitution 
  Higher the isoquant  higher will be the level of output produced  A set of 
isoquants which represents different levels of output is called  isoquant 
map  In the isoquant map  the isoquants on the right side represent higher 
levels of output and vice versa

Isocost Line 
The isocost line plays an important role in determining the combination of 
factors that the firm will choose for production  An isocost line is defined as locus of 
points representing various combinations of two factors  which the firm can buy with 
a given outlay  Higher isocost lines represent higher outlays  total cost  and lower 
isocost lines represent lower outlays 
The isocost line depends on two things  
  Prices of the factors of production and 
  the total outlay  which a firm has to make on the factors of production  Given 
these two  the isocost line can be drawn  The slope of the isocost line is 
equal to the ratio of the prices of two factors  Thus the slope of the isocost 
line is given as 
Price of factor X  Capital 
Slope of isocost line  
Price of factor Y  Labour 
Producer s Equilibrium 
A rational producer always tries to achieve largest volume of output from a 
given factor-expenditure outlay on factors such that these factors are combined in 
an optimal or most efficient way  The producer maximises his profits and produces a 
given level of output with least combination of factors  This level of cost combination 
of factors will be optimum for him

E  S is the same as all the three points lie on the same isocost line  But the output 
produced at point E is higher as E lies on a higher isoquant  Given the isocost line  
 
and the series of isoquants  isoquant-map  a producer will choose that level of 
output  where a given isocost line is tangential to the highest possible isoquant 
Thus the producer is in equilibrium at point E where the isoquant is tangential 
to the isocost line  At this point  the slopes of the isoquant and the isocost line are 
equal  Thus at the equilibrium point the marginal rate of technical substitution is equal 
to the price ratio of factors  Hence  the condition for producers  equilibrium is 
MRTSxy   PX PY 
At this point of equilibrium  the combination E  that is OL of labour and OQ of 
capital  is called least cost 
The Cobb   Douglas Production Function 
The simplest and the most widely used production function in economics is 
the Cobb-Douglas production function  It is a statistical production function given by 
professors C W  Cobb and P H  Douglas 
The Cobb-Douglas production function can be stated as follows 
Q   bL a C  -a in which 
Q   Actual output 
L   Labour 
C   Capital 
b   number of units of Labour 
a   Exponent  of labour 
 -a   Exponent  of Capital 
According to the above production function  if both factors of production 
 labour and capital  are increased by one percent  the output  total product  will 
increase by the sum of the exponents of labour and capital i e  by  a -a  Since 
a -a   according to the equation  when the inputs are increased by one percent 
the output also increases by one percent  Thus the Cobb Douglas production function 
explains only constant returns to scale  This is mainly because the addition of 
Q   bLa 
 Cb 
In the above production function  the sum of the exponents shows the degree of 
 returns to scale  in production function 
a   b     Increasing returns to scale 
a   b     Constant returns to scale 
a   b     Decreasing returns to scale 
 
  Exponent- a raised figure or symbol that shows how many times a quantity must be 
multiplied by itself  For example in a 
 -   is the exponent 
 
Large Scale Production   Kinds of Economies 
Economies of Scale 
 Economies  mean advantages  Scale refers to the size of unit   Economies 
of Scale  refers to the cost advantages due to the larger size of production  As 
the volume of production increases  the overhead cost will come down  The bulk 
purchase of inputs will give a better bargaining power to the producer which will 
reduce the average variable cost too  All these advantages are due to the large scale 
production and these advantages are called economies of scale 
There are two types of economies of scale 
a  Internal economies of scale  b  External economies of scale 
a  Internal Economies of Scale 
 Internal economies of scale  are the advantages enjoyed within the production 
unit  These economies are enjoyed by a single firm independently of the action of the 
other firms  For instance  one firm may enjoy the advantage of good management 
another may have the advantage of more up-to-date machinery  There are five kinds 
of internal economies  They are 
  Technical Economies  As the size of the firm is large  the availability of 
capital is more  Due to this  a firm can introduce up- to-date technologies 
thereby the increase in the productivity becomes possible  It is also possible 
to conduct research and development which will help to increase the quality 
of the product 
  Financial Economies  It is possible for big firms to float shares in the 
market for capital formation  Small firms have to borrow capital whereas 
large firms can buy capital 
  Managerial Economies  Division of labour is the result of large scale 
production  Right person can be employed in the right department only if 
there is division of labour  This will help a manager to fix responsibility to 
each department and thereby the productivity can be increased and the total 
production can be maximised 
  Labour Economies  Large Scale production paves the way for division of 
labour  This is also known as specialisation of labour  The specialisation will 
increase the quality and ability of the labour  As a result  the productivity of 
the firm increases 
  Marketing Economies  In production  the first buyer is the producer who 
buys the raw materials  As the size is large  the quantity bought is larger 
This gives the producer a better bargaining power  Also he can enjoy credit 
facilities  All these are possible because of large scale production  Buying is 
the first function in marketing 
 
  Economies of survival  A large firm can have many products  Even if one 
product fails in the market  the loss incurred in that product can be managed 
by the profit earned from the other products 
b External economies of scale 
When many firms expand in a particular area   i e  when the industry grows  
they enjoy a number of advantages which are known as external economies of scale 
This is not the advantage enjoyed by a single firm but by all the firms in the industry 
due to the structural growth  They are 
a  Increased transport facilities 
b  Banking facilities 
c  Development of townships 
d  Information and communication development 
All these facilities are available to all firms in an industrial region 
Diseconomies of Scale 
The diseconomies are the disadvantages arising to a firm or a group of firms 
due to large scale production 
Internal Diseconomies of Scale 
If a firm continues to grow and expand beyond the optimum capacity  the 
economies of scale disappear and diseconomies will start operating  For instance  if 
the size of a firm increases  after a point the difficulty of management arises to that 
particular firm which will increase the average cost of production of that firm  This is 
known as internal diseconomies of scale 
External Diseconomies of Scale 
Beyond a certain stage  too much concentration and localisation of industries 
will create diseconomies in production which will be common for all firms in a locality 
For instance  the expansion of an industry in a particular area leads to high rents and 
high costs  These are the external diseconomies as this affects all the firms in the 
industry located in that particular region

Chapter  
Cost and Revenue 
Cost 
The term  cost of production  means expenses incurred in the production of 
a commodity  This refers to the total amount of money spent on the production of a 
commodity  The determinants of cost of production are  the size of plant  the level of 
production  the nature of technology used  the quantity of inputs used  managerial 
and labour efficiency  Thus the cost of production of a commodity is the aggregate of 
prices paid for the factors of production used in producing a commodity 
Cost function 
The cost function expresses a functional relationship between costs and 
output that determine it  Symbolically  the cost function is 
C   f  Q 
where 
C   Cost 
Q   Output 
Cost concepts and classifications 
Money cost and Real cost 
Money cost or nominal cost is the total money expenses incurred by a firm in 
producing a commodity 
It includes 
 i  Cost of raw materials 
 ii  Wages and salaries of labour 
 iii  Expenditure on machinery and equipment 
 iv  Depreciation on machines  buildings and such other capital goods 
 v  Interest on capital 
 vi  Other expenses like advertisement  insurance premium and taxes 
 vii  Normal profit of the entrepreneur 
Real cost is a subjective concept  It expresses the pains and sacrifices 
involved in producing a commodity  The money paid for securing the factors of 
productions is money cost whereas the efforts and sacrifice made by the capitalists 
to save and invest  by the workers in foregoing leisure and by the landlords constitute 
real costs 
 
Opportunity Cost 
The opportunity cost of any good is the next best alternative good that is 
sacrificed  For example a farmer who is producing wheat can produce potatoes with 
the same factors  Therefore the opportunity cost of a quintal of wheat is the amount 
of output of potatoes given up 
Accounting Cost and Economic cost 
Accounting cost or explicit cost 
Accounting costs or explicit costs are the payments made by the entrepreneur 
to the suppliers of various productive factors  The accounting costs are only those 
costs  which are directly paid out or accounted for by the producer i e  wages to the 
labourers employed  prices for the raw materials purchased  fuel and power used 
rent for the building hired for the production work  the rate of interest on the borrowed 
capital and the taxes paid 
Economic cost 
The economic cost includes not only the explicit cost but also the implicit 
cost  The money rewards for the own services of the entrepreneur and the factors 
owned by himself and employed in production are known as implicit costs or imputed 
costs  The normal return on money capital invested by the entrepreneur  the wages 
or salary for his own services and rent of the land and buildings belonging to him 
and used in production constitute implicit cost  Thus Economic cost   Explicit cost  
Implicit cost 
It may be pointed out that the firm will earn economic profits only if it is making 
revenue in excess of economic cost 
Economic profit   Total Revenue   Economic Costs 
Private cost and social cost 
Private cost is the cost incurred by a firm for production  It includes both 
implicit costs and explicit costs 
Social costs are those costs  which are not borne by the producing firm but are 
incurred by others in society  For example  when an oil refinery discharges its waste 
in the river causing water pollution  such a pollution results in tremendous health 
hazards which involve costs to the society as a whole 
Fixed cost and variable cost 
Fixed cost and variable cost are helpful in understanding the behaviour of 
costs over different levels of output 
 
Meaning of Fixed and Variable factors and costs 
Fixed and variable factors are with reference to short run production function 
Short run is a period of time over which certain factors of production cannot 
be changed  and such factors are called fixed factors  The costs incurred on fixed 
factors are called fixed costs  The factors whose quantity can be changed in the short 
run are variable factors  and the costs incurred on variable factors are called variable 
costs 
Fixed costs are those which are independent of output  that is  they do not 
change with changes in output  These costs are a  fixed  amount  which must 
be incurred by a firm in the short run whether the output is small or large  E g 
contractual rent  interest on capital invested  salaries to the permanent staff 
insurance premia and certain taxes 
Variable costs are those costs  which are incurred on the employment of 
variable factors of production whose amount can be altered in the short run  Thus the 
total variable costs change with the level of output  It rises when output expands and 
falls when output contracts  When output is nil  variable cost becomes zero  These 
costs include payments such as wages of labour employed  prices of raw materials 
fuel and power used and the transport costs 
Total cost 
Total cost is the sum of total fixed cost and total variable cost 
 TC   TFC   TVC where 
 TC   Total cost 
 TFC   Total Fixed cost 
 TVC   Total variable cost 
It should be noted that total fixed cost is the same irrespective of the level of 
output  Therefore a change in total cost is influenced by the change in variable cost 
only 
The relationship between total fixed cost  total variable cost and total cost will 
be clear from the Figure  
 
Short run average cost curves 
Average Fixed Cost  AFC 
The average fixed cost is the fixed cost per unit of output  It is obtained by 
dividing the total fixed cost by the number of units of the commodity produced 
Symbolically AFC   TFC   Q 
Where AFC   Average fixed Cost 
 TFC   Total Fixed cost 
 Q   number of units of output produced 
Suppose for a firm the total fixed cost is Rs   when output is   units 
AFC will be Rs     Rs   and when output is   units  AFC will be Rs 
    Rs - Since total fixed cost is a constant quantity  average fixed cost will 
steadily fall as output increases  when output becomes very large  average fixed cost 
approaches zero 
Average Variable cost  AVC  Average variable cost is the variable cost per 
unit of output  It is the total variable cost divided by the number of units of output 
produced 
 AVC   TVC   Q 
 Where AVC   Average Variable Cost 
 TVC   Total Variable Cost 
 Q   number of units of output produced 
Average variable cost curve is  U  Shaped  As the output increases  the AVC will fall 
upto normal capacity output due to the operation of increasing returns  But beyond 
the normal capacity output  the AVC will rise due to the operation of diminishing 
returns 
Average Total Cost or Average Cost   Average total cost is simply called 
average cost which is the total cost divided by the number of units of output 
produced 
AC   TC   Q where 
AC   Average Cost 
TC   Total Cost 
Q   number of units of output produced 
Average cost is the sum of average fixed cost and average variable cost 
i e  AC   AFC AVC

The average cost is also known as the unit cost since it is the cost per unit of 
output produced  The following figure shows the shape of AFC  AVC and ATC in the 
short period 
From the figure   it can be understood that the behaviour of the average 
total cost curve depends on the behaviour of AFC and AVC curves  In the beginning 
both AFC and AVC fall  So ATC curve falls  When AVC curve begins rising  AFC curve 
falls steeply ie fall in AFC is more than the rise in AVC  So ATC curve continues to 
fall  But as output increases further  there is a sharp increase in AVC  which is more 
than the fall in AFC  Hence ATC curve rises after a point  The ATC curve like AVC 
curve falls first  reaches the minimum value and then rises  Hence it has taken a U 
shape 
Marginal Cost 
Marginal cost is defined as the addition made to the total cost by the 
production of one additional unit of output 
 
Table   Computation of marginal cost 
Output  units  Total cost  Rs  Marginal Cost  Rs 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For example  when a firm produces   units of output  the marginal cost 
would be equal to the total cost of producing   units minus the total cost of 
producing   units  Suppose the total cost of producing   units is Rs   and 
the total cost of producing   units is Rs   then the marginal cost will be 
Rs      Rs     Rs   The firm has incurred a sum of Rs   in the 
production of one more unit of the commodity  Symbolically 
MCn   TCn 
   TCn-  where 
MCn   Marginal cost 
TC n   Total cost of producing n units 
TC n-    Total cost of producing n-  units 
 The marginal cost curve is given below 
The marginal cost curve is  U  shaped  The shape of the cost curve is 
determined by the law of variable proportions  If increasing returns  economies of 
scale is in operation  the marginal cost curve will be declining  as the cost will be 
decreasing with the increase in output  When the diminishing returns  diseconomies 
of scale  are in operation  the MC curve will be increasing as it is the situation of 
increasing cost 
 
Relationship between short-run average and short-run marginal cost curves 
The relationship between the marginal and the average cost is more a 
mathematical one rather than economic 
The relationship can be given as follows 
  When marginal cost is less than average cost  average cost is falling 
  When marginal cost is greater than the average cost  average cost is rising 
  The marginal cost curve must cut the average cost curve at AC s minimum 
point from below  Thus at the minimum point of AC  MC is equal to AC 
Long run Average Cost Curve  LAC 
In the long-run all factors are variable  Therefore the firm can change the size 
of the plant  capital equipment  machinery etc  to meet the changes in demand  A 
long-run average cost curve depicts the functional relationship between output and 
the long-run cost of production 
Long-run average cost curve 
 
The Long run Average Cost  LAC  Curve is based on the assumption 
that in the long run a firm has a number of alternatives with regard to the scale of 
operations  For each scale of production or plant size  the firm has an appropriate 
short-run average cost  SAC  curve  The pattern of these short-run average cost 
curves is shown in Figure   We have assumed that technologically there are 
only three sizes of plants   small  medium and large  SAC 
 is relevant for a small 
size plant  SAC 
 for a medium size plant and SAC 
 for a large sizeplant  In the short 
period  when the output demanded is OA  the firm will choose the smallest size plant 
But for an output beyond OB  the firm will choose medium size plant as the average 
cost of small size plant is higher for the same output  JC KC  For output beyond 
OD  the firm will choose large size plant  SAC 
  In the short-run  the firm is tied with 
a given plant but in the long-run  the firm moves from one plant to another  As the 
scale of production is changed  a new plant is added  The long-run cost of production 
is the least possible cost of production of any given level of output  when all inputs 
become variable  including the size of the plant 
The long run average cost curve is called  planning curve  of a firm as it helps 
in choosing a plant on the decided level of output  The long- run average cost curve 
is also called envelope curve as it supports or envelops a group of short-run cost 
curves  Figure   From the figure we can understand that the long run average 
cost curve initially falls with increase in output and after a certain point it rises making 
a boat shape 
CONCEPTS OF REVENUE 
The amount of money  which the firm receives by the sale of its output in the 
market  is known as its revenue 
Total Revenue 
Total Revenue refers to the total amount of money that a firm receives from 
the sale of its products 
Mathematically TR   PQ where TR   Total Revenue  P   Price  Q   Quantity 
sold  Suppose a firm sells   units of a product at the price of Rs   each  the total 
revenue will be   x Rs     Rs  - 
Average Revenue 
Average revenue is the revenue per unit of the commodity sold  It is calculated 
by dividing the total revenue by the number of units sold 
AR   TR   Q Where 
AR   Average Revenue 
TR   Total Revenue 
Q   Quantity sold 
 
Eg  Average Revenue          
  Rs Rs 
Thus average revenue means price of the product 
Marginal Revenue 
Marginal Revenue is the addition made to the total revenue by selling one 
more unit of a commodity 
For example  if   units of a product are sold at the price of Rs   and   units 
are sold at Rs -  the marginal revenue will be 
MRn   TRn 
   TRn- 
   Rs  x     Rs  x  
   Rs      
   Rs  - 
Relationship between AR and MR curves 
When the average revenue  price  remains constant  the marginal revenue will 
also remain constant and will coincide with the average revenue

A firm can sell large quantities only at lower prices  In that case  the average 
revenue  price  of the product falls  When AR falls MR will also fall  But fall in MR will 
be more than the fall in the AR  Hence the marginal revenue curve will lie below the 
average revenue curve  Fig

Measurement of Profit 
A firm s profit may be defined as the difference between its total revenue and 
its total cost i e  Profit   Total Revenue   Total Cost 
The aim of any firm is to maximise its profit i e  to maximise the positive 
difference between the Total Revenue  TR  and Total Cost  TC  At that point the 
producer will be in equilibrium 
Table   Maximising Profits 
Output  units  Total Revenue Rs  Total Cost  Rs  Total Profit Rs 
      - 
       
       
       
 
       
       
       
       
       
      - 
From Table   it can be understood the firm will earn maximum profit of Rs  
when it produces   units of output  Thus the firm will be in equilibrium by producing  
units of output 
Its profit is the maximum at OM level of output where the distance between 
the TR curve and the TC curve is the maximum  When the firm produces OL level 
of output  and OH level of output  total revenue just equals total cost  TR   TC  At 
these points  the firm is making neither profits nor losses  Thus the points S and Q 
are called Break- even points

Chapter  
Market Structure and Pricing 
Meaning and Definition of Market 
Market generally means a place or a geographical area  where buyers 
with money and sellers with their goods meet to exchange goods for money 
In Economics market refers to a group of buyers and sellers who involve in the 
transaction of commodities and services 
Characteristics of a market 
  Existence of buyers and sellers of the commodity 
  The establishment of contact between the buyers and sellers  Distance is of 
no consideration if buyers and sellers could contact each other through the 
available communication system like telephone  agents  letter correspondence 
and Internet 
  Buyers and sellers deal with the same commodity or variety  Since the market 
in economics is identified on the basis of the commodity  similarity of the 
product is very essential 
  There should be a price for the commodity bought and sold in the market 
Classification of Markets 
A  Market according to Area 
Based on the extent of the market for any product  markets can be classified 
into local regional  national and international markets 
Local Market 
A local market for a product exists when buyers and sellers of commodity carry 
on business in a particular locality or village or area where the demand and supply 
conditions are influenced by local conditions only  E g  Perishable goods like milk and 
vegetables and bulky articles like bricks and stones 
National Market 
When commodities are demanded and supplied throughout the country  there 
is national market e g  wheat  rice or cotton 
Regional Market 
Commodities that are demanded and supplied over a region have regional 
market 
 
Global Market 
When demand and supply conditions are influenced at the global level  we 
have international market  e g  gold  silver  cell phone etc 
On the basis of demand and supply  this geographical classification is made 
With improved transport facilities and communications  even goods of local markets 
can become international goods 
B Market according to time 
Marshall classified market based on the time element  In economics  time 
does not mean clock time  It means only the division of time based on extend of 
adjustability of supply of a commodity for a given change in its demand  The major 
divisions are very short period  short period and long period 
Very Short Period 
Very short period refers to the type of competitive market in which the supply 
of commodities cannot be changed at all  So in a very short period  the market supply 
is perfectly inelastic  The price of the commodity depends on the demand for the 
product alone  The perishable commodities like flowers are the best example 
Short-period 
Short period refers to that period in which supply can be adjusted to a 
limited extent by varying the variable factors alone  The short period supply curve is 
relatively elastic  The short period price is determined by the interaction of the shortrun 
supply and demand curves 
Long Period 
Long period is the time period during which the supply conditions are fully 
able to meet the new demand conditions  In the long run  all  both fixed as well 
as variable  factors are variable  Thus the supply curve in the long run is perfectly 
elastic  Therefore  it is the demand that influences price in the long period 
C Market according to competition 
These markets are classified according to the number of sellers in the 
market and the nature of the commodity  The classification of market according to 
competition is as follows 
 
Perfect Competition 
Perfect competition is a market situation where there are infinite number 
of sellers that no one is big enough to have any appreciable influence over market 
price 
Features and Conditions of perfect competition 
  Large number of buyers and sellers 
There are a large number of buyers and sellers in a perfect competitive market 
that neither a single buyer nor a single seller can influence the price  The price is 
determined by market forces namely the demand for and the supply of the product 
There will be uniform price in the market  Sellers accept this price and adjust the 
quantity produced to maximise their profit  Thus the sellers in the perfect competitive 
market are price- takers and quantity adjusters 
  Homogeneous Product 
The products produced by all the firms in the perfectly competitive market 
must be homogeneous and identical in all respects i e  the products in the market 
are the same in quantity  size  taste  etc  The products of different firms are perfect 
substitutes and the cross- elasticity is infinite 
  Perfect knowledge about market conditions 
Both buyers and sellers are fully aware of the current price in the market 
Therefore the buyer will not offer high price and the sellers will not accept a price less 
than the one prevailing in the market

  Free entry and Free exit 
There must be complete freedom for the entry of new firms or the exit of the 
existing firms from the industry  When the existing firms are earning super-normal 
profits  new firms enter into the market  When there is loss in the industry  some firms 
leave the industry  The free entry and free exit are possible only in the long run  That 
is because the size of the plant cannot be changed in the short run 
  Perfect mobility of factors of production 
The factors of productions should be free to move from one use to another 
or from one industry to another easily to get better remuneration  The assumption of 
perfect mobility of factors is essential to fulfil the first condition namely large number 
of producers in the market 
  Absence of transport cost 
In a perfectly competitive market  it is assumed that there are no transport 
costs  Under perfect competition  a commodity is sold at uniform price throughout the 
market  If transport cost is incurred  the firms nearer to the market will charge a low 
price than the firms far away  Hence it is assumed that there is no transport cost 
  Absence of Government or artificial restrictions or collusions 
There are no government controls or restrictions on supply  pricing etc  There 
is also no collusion among buyers or sellers  The price in the perfectly competitive 
market is free to change in response to changes in demand and supply conditions 
Nature of Revenue curves 
Under perfect competition  the market price is determined by the market forces 
namely the demand for and the supply of the products  Hence there is uniform price 
in the market and all the units of the output are sold at the same price  As a result 
the average revenue is perfectly elastic  The average revenue curve is horizontally 
parallel to X-axis  Since the Average Revenue is constant  Marginal Revenue is also 
constant and coincides with Average Revenue  AR curve of a firm represents the 
demand curve for the product produced by that firm 
Short run equilibrium price and output determination under perfect competition 
  Since a firm in the perfectly competitive market is a price-taker  it has to 
adjust its level of output to maximise its profit  The aim of any producer is to 
maximise his profit 
  The short run is a period in which the number and plant size of the firms 
are fixed  In this period  the firm can produce more only by increasing the 
variable inputs 
 
  As the entry of new firms or exit of the existing firms are not possible in the 
short-run  the firm in the perfectly competitive market can either earn supernormal 
profit or normal profit or incur loss in the short period 
Super-normal Profit 
When the average revenue of the firm is greater than its average cost  the firm 
is earning super-normal profit 
Short-run equilibrium with super-normal profits

In figure   output is measured along the x-axis and price  revenue and cost 
along the y-axis  OP is the prevailing price in the market  PL is the demand curve or 
average and the marginal revenue curve  SAC and SMC are the short run average 
and marginal cost curves  The firm is in equilibrium at point  E  where MR   MC and 
MC curve cuts MR curve from below at the point of equilibrium  Therefore the firm will 
be producing OM level of output  At the OM level of output ME is the AR and MF is 
the average cost  The profit per unit of output is EF  the difference between ME and 
MF  The total profits earned by the firm will be equal to EF  profit per unit  multiplied 
by OM or HF  total output  Thus the total profits will be equal to the area HFEP 
HFEP is the supernormal profits earned by the firm 
Long run equilibrium  price and output determination 
In the long run  all factors are variable  The firms can increase their output by 
increasing the number and plant size of the firms  Moreover  new firms can enter the 
industry and the existing firms can leave the industry  As a result  all the existing firms 
will earn only normal profit in the long run 
If the existing firms earn supernormal profit  the new firms will enter the 
industry to compete with the existing firms  As a result  the output produced will 
increase  When the total output increases  the demand for factors of production will 
increase leading to increase in prices of the factors  This will result in increase in 
average cost 
On the other side  when the output produced increases  the supply of the 
product increases  The demand remaining the same  when the supply of the product  
 
increases  the price of the product comes down  Hence the average revenue will 
come down  A fall in average revenue and the rise in average cost will continue till 
both become equal   AR   AC  Thus  all the perfectly competitive firms will earn 
normal profit in the long run 
Figure   represents long run equilibrium of firm under perfect competition 
The firm is in equilibrium at point S where LMC   MR   AR   LAC  The long run 
equilibrium output is ON  The firm is earning just the normal profit  The equilibrium 
price is OP  If the price rises above OP  the firm will earn abnormal profit  which will 
attract new firms into the industry  If the price is less than OP  there will be loss and 
the tendency will be to exit  So in the long run equilibrium  OP will be the price and 
marginal cost will be equal to average cost and average revenue  Thus the firm in 
the long run will earn only normal profit  Competitive firms are in equilibrium at the 
minimum point of LAC curve  Operating at the minimum point of LAC curve signifies 
that the firm is of optimum size i e  producing output at the lowest possible average 
cost 
Advantages of perfect competition 
  There is consumer sovereignty in a perfect competitive market  The consumer 
is rational and he has perfect knowledge about the market conditions 
Therefore  he will not purchase the products at a higher price 
  In the perfectly competitive market  the price is equal to the minimum average 
cost  It is beneficial to the consumer 
  The perfectly competitive firms are price-takers and the products are 
homogeneous  Therefore it is not necessary for the producers to incur 
expenditure on advertisement to promote sales  This reduces the wastage of 
resources 
  In the long run  the perfectly competitive firm is functioning at the optimum level 
This means that maximum economic efficiency in production is achieved  As 
the actual output produced by the firm is equal to the optimum output  there is 
no idle or unused or excess capacity   
 
Monopoly 
Monopoly is a market structure in which there is a single seller  there are no 
close substitutes for the commodity it produces and there are barriers to entry 
Characteristics of Monopoly 
  Single Seller  There is only one seller  he can control either price or supply of 
his product  But he cannot control demand for the product  as there are many 
buyers 
  No close Substitutes  There are no close substitutes for the product  The 
buyers have no alternatives or choice  Either they have to buy the product or go 
without it 
  Price  The monopolist has control over the supply so as to increase the price 
Sometimes he may adopt price discrimination  He may fix different prices for 
different sets of consumers  A monopolist can either fix the price or quantity of 
output  but he cannot do both  at the same time 
  No Entry  There is no freedom to other producers to enter the market as the 
monopolist is enjoying monopoly power  There are strong barriers for new firms 
to enter  There are legal  technological  economic and natural obstacles  which 
may block the entry of new producers 
  Firm and Industry  Under monopoly  there is no difference between a firm 
and an industry  As there is only one firm  that single firm constitutes the whole 
industry   
Causes for Monopoly 
  Natural  A monopoly may arise on account of some natural causes  Some 
minerals are available only in certain regions  For example  South Africa has 
the monopoly of diamonds  nickel in the world is mostly available in Canada 
and oil in Middle East  This is natural monopoly 
  Technical  Monopoly power may be enjoyed due to technical reasons  A firm 
may have control over raw materials  technical knowledge  special know-how 
scientific secrets and formula that enable a monopolist to produce a commodity 
e g  Coco Cola 
  Legal  Monopoly power is achieved through patent rights  copyright and trade 
marks by the producers  This is called legal monopoly 
  Large Amount of Capital  The manufacture of some goods requires a large 
amount of capital or lumpiness of capital  All firms cannot enter the field 
because they cannot afford to invest such a large amount of capital  This may 
give rise to monopoly  For example  iron and steel industry  railways  etc 
 
  State  Government will have the sole right of producing and selling some 
goods  They are State monopolies  For example  we have public utilities like 
electricity and railways  These public utilities are undertaken by the State 
Price and Output Determination 
A monopolist like a perfectly competitive firm tries to maximise his profits 
A monopoly firm faces a downward sloping demand curve  that is  its average 
revenue curve  The downward sloping demand curve implies that larger output can 
be sold only by reducing the price  Its marginal revenue curve will be below the 
average revenue curve 
The average cost curve is  U  shaped  The monopolist will be in equilibrium 
when MC   MR and the MC curve cuts the MR curve from below 
In figure   AR is the Average Revenue Curve and MR is the Marginal 
revenue curve  AR curve is falling and MR curve lies below AR  The monopolist is 
in equilibrium at E where MR   MC  He produces OM units of output and fixes price 
at OP  At OM output  the average revenue is MS and average cost MT  Therefore 
the profit per unit is MS-MT   TS  Total profit is average profit  TS  multiplied by 
output  OM  which is equal to HTSP  The monopolist is in equilibrium at point E and 
produces OM output at which he is earning maximum profit  The monopoly price is 
higher than the marginal revenue and marginal cost  COST   REVENUE

OUTPUT 
Advantages 
  Monopoly firms have large-scale production possibilities and also can enjoy 
both internal and external economies  This will result in the reduction of 
costs of production  Output can be sold at low prices  This is beneficial to the 
consumers 
  Monopoly firms have vast financial resources which could be used for research 
and development  This will enable the firms to innovate quickly 
 
  There are a number of weak firms in an industry  These firms can combine 
together in the form of monopoly to meet competition  In such a case  market 
can be expanded 
Although there are some advantages  there is a danger that monopoly power 
might be misused for exploiting the consumers 
Disadvantages 
  A monopolist always charges a high price  which is higher than the competitive 
price  Thus a monopolist exploits the consumers 
  A monopolist is interested in getting maximum profit  He may restrict the output 
and raise prices  Thus  he creates artificial scarcity for his product 
  A monopolist often charges different prices for the same product from different 
consumers  He extracts maximum price according to the ability to pay of 
different consumers 
  A monopolist uses large-scale production and huge resources to promote 
his own selfish interest  He may adopt wrong practices to establish absolute 
monopoly power 
  In a country dominated by monopolies  wealth is concentrated in the hands of 
a few  It will lead to inequality of incomes  This is against the principle of the 
socialistic pattern of society 
Methods of Controlling Monopoly 
  Legislative Method  Government can control monopolies by legal actions 
Anti-monopoly legislation has been enacted to check the growth of monopoly 
In India  the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act was passed in 
  The objective of this Act is to prevent the unwanted growth of private 
monopolies and concentration of economic power in the hands of a small 
number of individuals and families 
  Controlling Price and Output  This method can be applied in the case of 
natural monopolies  Government would fix either price or output or both 
  Taxation  Taxation is another method by which the monopolistic power can 
be prevented or restricted  Government can impose a lump-sum tax on a 
monopoly firm  irrespective of its level of output  Consequently  its total profit 
will fall 
  Nationalisation  Nationalising big companies is one of the solutions 
Government may take over such monopolistic companies  which are exploiting 
the consumers 
 
  Consumer s Association  The growth of monopoly power can also be 
controlled by encouraging the formation of consumers associations to improve 
the bargaining power of consumers 
Comparison between Perfect Competition and Monopoly 
The main aim of firms both under monopoly and perfect competition is to 
maximise profit  In both the market forms  the firms are in equilibrium at the output 
level where MC   MR  The differences are as follows 
Perfect Competition Monopoly 
  Average revenue curve is a 
horizontal straight line parallel to X 
axis  Marginal revenue is equal to 
average revenue and price 
Both average revenue curve and 
marginal revenue curve are downward 
falling curves  Marginal revenue is less 
than average revenue and price 
  At the equilibrium  MC   MR   AR 
That is price charged is equal to 
marginal cost of production 
At the equilibrium  MC   MR   AR that 
is price charged is above marginal cost 
  The firm in the long run comes to 
equilibrium at the minimum point 
or the lowest point of the long run 
average cost curve  The firm tends 
to be of optimum size operating at 
the minimum average cost 
Even in the long run equilibrium the 
firm will be operating at a higher level 
of average cost  The firm stops short of 
optimum size 
  Equilibrium can be conceived only 
under increasing cost and not 
under decreasing or constant cost 
conditions 
Equilibrium situation is possible at 
increasing  decreasing or constant cost 
conditions 
  The firm can earn only normal profit 
in the long run and may earn super 
profit in the short run 
But monopoly firm earns super normal 
profit both in short run and long run 
  Price will be lower and the output is 
larger 
Price is higher and the output will be 
smaller 
Price Discrimination 
Price discrimination means the practice of selling the same commodity at 
different prices to different buyers  If the monopolist charges different prices from 
different consumers for the same commodity  it is called price discrimination or 
discriminating monopoly 
 
Definition 
Price discrimination may be defined as  the sale of technically similar products 
at prices which are not proportional to marginal cost  For example  all cinema 
theatres charge different prices for different classes of people 
Conditions of Price Discrimination 
Price discrimination is possible only if the following conditions are fulfilled 
  The demand must not be transferable from the high priced market to the low 
priced market  If rich people do not buy the high-priced deluxe edition of the 
book  but wait for the low-priced popular edition to come out  then personal 
discrimination will fail 
  The monopolist should keep the two markets or different markets separate so 
that the commodity will not be moving from one market to the other market  If it 
is possible to buy the product in the cheaper market of the monopolist and sell 
it in the dearer market  there can never be two prices for the commodity  If the 
industrial buyer of cheap electricity uses it for domestic consumption  then trade 
discrimination will fail 
The above two conditions are essential to adopt price discrimination 
Monopolistic Competition 
Monopolistic competition  as the name itself implies  is a blending of monopoly 
and competition  Monopolistic competition refers to the market situation in which a 
large number of sellers produce goods which are close substitutes of one another 
The products are similar but not identical  The particular brand of product will have 
a group of loyal consumers  In this respect  each firm will have some monopoly and 
at the same time the firm has to compete in the market with the other firms as they 
produce a fair substitute  The essential features of monopolistic competition are 
product differentiation and existence of many sellers 
The following are the examples of monopolistic competition in Indian context 
  Shampoo - Sun Silk  Clinic Plus  Ponds  Chik  Velvette  Kadal  Head 
 and Shoulder  Pantene  Vatika  Garnier  Meera 
  Tooth Paste - Binaca  Colgate  Forhans  Close-up  Promise  Pepsodent 
 Vicco Vajradanti  Ajanta  Anchor  Babool 
Characteristics of Monopolistic Competition 
 i  Existence of Large Number of firms  Under monopolistic competition  the 
number of firms producing a commodity will be very large  The term  very large 
denotes that contribution of each firm towards the total demand of the product is 
small  Each firm will act independently on the basis of product differentiation and  
 
each firm determines its price-output policies  Any action of the individual firm in 
increasing or decreasing the output will have little or no effect on other firms 
 ii  Product differentiation  Product differentiation is the essence of monopolistic 
competition  Product differentiation is the process of altering goods that serve the 
same purpose so that they differ in minor ways 
Product differentiation can be brought about in various ways  Product 
differentiation is attempted through  a  physical difference   b  quality difference 
 c  imaginary difference and  d  purchase benefit difference  It may be by using 
different quality of the raw material and different chemicals and mixtures used in the 
product  Difference in workmanship  durability and strength will also make product 
differentiation  Product differentiation may also be effected by offering customers 
some benefits with the sale of the product  Facilities like free servicing  home 
delivery  acceptance of returned goods  etc  would make the customers demand that 
particular brand of product when such facilities are available  Product differentiation 
through effective advertisement is another method  This is known as sales promotion 
By frequently advertising the brand of the product through press  film  radio  and TV 
the consumers are made to feel that the brand produced by the firm in question is 
superior to that of other brands sold by other firms 
 iii  Selling Costs  From the discussion of  product differentiation  we can infer that 
the producer under monopolistic competition has to incur expenses to popularise 
his brand  This expenditure involved in selling the product is called selling cost 
According to Prof  Chamberlin  selling cost is  the cost incurred in order to alter 
the position or shape of the demand curve for a product  Most important form of 
selling cost is advertisement  Sales promotion by advertisement is called non-price 
competition 
 iv  Freedom of entry and exit of firms  Another important feature is the freedom of 
any firm to enter into the field and produce the commodity under its own brand name 
and any firm can go out of the field if so chosen  There are no barriers as in the case 
of monopoly 
Monopolistic competition presupposes that customers have definite 
preferences for particular varieties or brand of products  Hence pricing is not the 
problem but product differentiation is the problem and competition is not on prices but 
on products 
Thus in monopolistic competition  the features of monopoly and perfect 
competition are partially present 
Determination of Equilibrium price and output under monopolistic competition 
The monopolistic competitive firm will come to equilibrium on the principle of 
equalising MR with MC  Each firm will choose that price and output where it will be  
 
maximising its profit  Figure   shows the equilibrium of the individual firm in the 
short period 
MC and AC are the short period marginal cost and average cost curves  The 
sloping down average revenue and marginal revenue curves are shown as AR and 
MR  The equilibrium point is E where MR   MC  The equilibrium output is OM and the 
price of the product is fixed at OP  The difference between average cost and average 
revenue is SQ  The output is OM  So  the supernormal profit for the firm is shown by 
the rectangle PQSR  The firm by producing OM units of its commodity and selling it 
at a price of OP per unit realizes the maximum profit in the short run 
The different firms in monopolistic competition may be making either abnormal 
profits or losses in the short period depending on their costs and revenue curves 
In the long run  if the existing firms earn super normal profit  the entry of 
new firms will reduce its share in the market  The average revenue of the product 
will come down  The demand for factors of production will increase the cost of 
production  Hence  the size of the profit will be reduced  If the existing firms incur 
losses in the long-run  some of the firms will leave the industry increasing the share 
of the existing firms in the market  As the demand for factors becomes less  the price 
of factors will come down  This will reduce the cost of production  which will increase 
the profit earned by the existing firm  Thus under monopolistic competition  all the 
existing firms will earn normal profit in the long run 
Wastages of Monopolistic competition 
  Unemployment  Under monopolistic competition  the firms produce less 
than optimum output  As a result  the productive capacity is not used to the 
fullest extent  This will lead to unemployment of resources 
  Excess capacity  Excess capacity is the difference between the optimum 
output that can be produced and the actual output produced by the firm 
In the long run  a monopolistic firm produces an output which is less than 
the optimum output that is the output corresponding to the minimum  
 
average cost  This leads to excess capacity which is regarded as waste in 
monopolistic competition 
  Advertisement  There is a lot of waste in competitive advertisements under 
monopolistic competition  The wasteful and competitive advertisements lead 
to high cost to consumers 
  Too Many Varieties of Goods  Introducing too many varieties of a good is 
another waste of monopolistic competition  The goods differ in size  shape 
style and colour  A reasonable number of varieties would be desirable  Cost 
per unit can be reduced if only a few are produced 
  Inefficient Firms  Under monopolistic competition  inefficient firms charge 
prices higher than their marginal cost  Such type of inefficient firms should 
be kept out of the industry  But  the buyers  preference for such products 
enables the inefficient firms to continue to exist  Efficient firms cannot drive 
out the inefficient firms because the former may not be able to attract the 
customers of the latter 
Oligopoly 
Oligopoly refers to a form of imperfect competition where there will be only a 
few sellers producing either homogenous or differentiated products 
Characteristics of Oligopoly 
  Interdependence  The most important feature of oligopoly is 
interdependence in decision - making  Since there are a few firms  each firm 
closely watches the activities of the other firm  Any change in price  output 
product  etc  by a firm will have a direct effect on the fortune of its rivals 
So an oligopolistic firm must consider not only the market demand for its 
product  but also the possible moves of other firms in the industry 
  Group Behaviour  Firms may realise the importance of mutual cooperation 
Then they will have a tendency of collusion  At the same time  the 
desire of each firm to earn maximum profit may encourage competitive spirit 
Thus  co-operative and collusive trend as well as competitive trend would 
prevail in an oligopolistic market 
Price Rigidity  Another important feature of oligopoly is price rigidity  Price is sticky 
or rigid at the prevailing level due to the fear of reaction from the rival firms  If an 
oligopolistic firm lowers its price  the price reduction will be followed by the rival 
firms  As a result  the firm loses its profit  Expecting the same kind of reaction  if the 
oligopolistic firm raises the price  the rival firms will not follow  This would result in 
losing customers  In both ways the firm would face difficulties  Hence the price is 
rigid

Chapter  
Marginal Productivity Theory of Distribution 
The marginal productivity theory of distribution is the general theory of 
distribution  The theory explains how prices of various factors of production are 
determined under conditions of perfect competition  It emphasizes that any variable 
factor must obtain a reward equal to its marginal product 
There is no fundamental difference between the mechanism of determination 
of factor prices and that of prices of commodities  Factor prices are determined in 
markets under the forces of supply and demand  But there is one difference  While 
the demand for commodities is direct demand  the demand for factors of production 
is derived demand  For example  there will be demand for workers engaged in 
construction industry  e g  masons  only when there is demand for housing 
According to the marginal productivity theory of distribution  in a perfectly 
competitive market  for products and inputs  each factor will be paid a price equal 
to the value of its physical product  Though the theory is applicable to all factors of 
production  we may illustrate it with reference to labour 
A firm will go on employing more and more units of a factor until the price of 
that factor is equal to the value of the marginal product  In other words  each factor 
will be rewarded according to its marginal productivity  The marginal productivity is 
equal to the value of the additional product which an employer gets when he employs 
an additional unit of that factor  We assume that the supply of all other factors remain 
constant 
We shall give a simple illustration of the marginal productivity theory of 
distribution by making use of labour 
The aim of a firm is maximization of profit  It will hire a factor as long as it adds 
more to total revenue than to total cost  Thus a firm will hire a factor upto the point at 
which the marginal unit contributes as much to total cost as to total revenue because 
total profit cannot be further increased 
The condition of equilibrium in the labour market is 
 MCL 
   VMPL 
 Where MCL 
   Marginal cost of labour 
 VMPL   Value of marginal product of labour 
 Or W   VMPL 
 Where W   wages of labour 
 
Note   It is assumed that a firm can employ any amount of labour under a given wage rate as 
the supply of labour is assumed to be unlimited in a competitive market

   Marginal physical product of labour multiplied by price of

Note   P  The price is assumed to be constant under conditions of perfect 
competition 
In fig    the equilibrium of the firm is shown by E  This is so because to the 
left of L  each unit of labour costs less than the value of its product  VMPL   W 
Hence the firm will make more profit by hiring more workers  To the right of VMPL W 
Hence  the profits of the firm will be reduced  So profits will be maximum when VMPL 
  W 
It follows from the above discussion that the demand curve of a firm for a 
single variable factor  e g  labour  is its value of marginal product curve 
Thus the productivity of the marginal unit of a factor determines the rate that is 
to be paid to all units of the factor  The employer adopts the principle of substitution 
and combines land  labour and capital in such a way that the cost of production is 
minimum  Then the reward for each factor is determined by its marginal productivity 
The marginal productivity theory of distribution has been used to explain the 
determination of rent  wages  interest and profits  That is why  it is called general 
theory of distribution 
 
Assumptions of the theory 
The marginal productivity theory is based on the following assumptions 
  There is perfect competition 
  All units of a factor are homogeneous  It means that one unit of a factor is the 
same as the other 
  Factors can be substituted for each other  That is  all factors are 
interchangeable 
  The theory is based on the law of diminishing returns as applied to business 
The law of diminishing returns tells that if you go on employing more and more 
units of a factor  its marginal returns will diminish  So a firm  when it comes to 
know that the increase in a certain factor is resulting in diminishing returns  the 
firm will substitute it with some other factor  Thereby  it will try to reduce the cost 
of production 
Criticism of the theory 
The following are some of the points of criticism against the marginal 
productivity theory of distribution 
  Every product is a joint product and its value cannot be separately attributed to 
either labour or capital  Again  it is rather difficult to measure the  productivity 
of certain categories of labour like doctors  lawyers and teachers who render 
services 
  The theory takes into account only the factors operating on the side of demand 
by ignoring the supply side  For example  when there is scarcity of a factor  it is 
paid much more than the normal price 
  The theory is based on the assumption of perfect competition and full 
employment  But in the real world  we have only imperfect competition  we do 
not have perfect competition 
  In practice  it is rather difficult to vary the use of the factors of production 
  The theory does not carry with it any ethical justification  If we accept the 
theory  it means that factors get the value of what they produce  For example 
workers in a firm may get low wages not because their productivity is low but 
because there might be exploitation of labour  Hence we should not make use 
of this theory to justify the existing system of unequal distribution 
We may note that in spite of the above points of criticism against the theory  it 
explains the role of productivity in the determination of factor prices  In the words of 
Marshall   the doctrine throws into clear light one of the causes that govern wages 
 
Rent 
In ordinary language   rent  refers to any periodic payment made for the 
use of a good  For example  when we live in someone s house  we pay rent  This 
rent is contract payment  The contract rent includes besides the payment made for 
the use of land  interest on the capital invested in the house  wages and profit  But 
classical economists like Ricardo referred by  rent  to the payment made for the use 
of agricultural land  Rent arises because of the peculiar characteristics of land  The 
supply of land is inelastic and it differs in fertility  Rent arises because of differences 
in fertility  Those lands which are more fertile than others get rent 
The Ricardian theory of Rent 
Ricardian theory of rent is one of the earliest theories of rent  It is named after 
Ricardo  a great classical economist of the  th century 
According to Ricardo   rent is that portion of the produce of the earth which is 
paid to the landlord for the use of the original and indestructible powers of the soil 
So rent is payment made for the use of land for its original powers  Ricardo believed 
that rent arose on account of differences in the fertility of land  Only superior lands 
get rent  Rent is a differential surplus 
Rent may also arise on account of situational advantage  For example  some 
lands may be nearer to the market  The producer can save a lot of transport costs 
Even if all lands are equally fertile  lands which enjoy situational advantage will earn 
rent 
Ricardo explained his theory by taking the example of colonization  If some 
people go and settle down in a place  first they will cultivate the best lands  If more 
people go and settle down  the demand for land will increase and they will cultivate 
the second-grade lands  The cost of production will go up  So the price of grain in 
the market must cover the cost of cultivation  In this case  the first grade land will get 
rent  After some time  if there is increase in population  even third grade lands will 
be cultivated  Now  even second grade lands will get rent and first grade lands will 
get more rent but the third grade land will not get rent  It is known as no - rent land 
According to Ricardo  rent is price determined  that is  it is determined by price of the 
grains produced in the land  He also believed that rent is high because price is high 
and not the other way round  Ricardo came to the conclusion that rent did not enter 
price because there are some no - rent or marginal lands  As the produce of no-rent 
land gets a price  Ricardo argued that rent did not enter price 
In figure   grades of land are shown along the X axis and the output up the 
y   axis  The shaded area in the diagram indicates rent  In this case  grade I and 
grade II lands get rent  The grade III land will not get rent 
 
Diagrammatic Illustration of Ricardian theory of Rent 
Criticism of the Ricardian Theory of Rent 
Ricardo tells that only the best lands are cultivated first  There is no historical proof 
for this 
  According to Ricardo  land has  original and indestructible powers  But 
the fertility of land may decline after some time because of continuous 
cultivation 
  Ricardo believed that rent is peculiar to land alone  But many modern 
economists argue that the rent aspect can be seen in other factors like 
labour and capital  Rent arises whenever the supply of a factor is inelastic in 
relation to the demand for it 
  Ricardo is of the view that rent does not enter the price of the commodity 
produced in it  But rent enters the price from the point of view of a single 
firm 
  Ricardian theory does not take note of scarcity rent 
  It is based on perfect competition  Only under perfect competition  there will 
be one price for a good  But in the real world  we have imperfect competition 
Though there are some criticisms against the Ricardian theory  we may note it 
tells that because of increasing pressure on land  we have to cultivate inferior lands 
Modern Theory of Rent 
In the modern theory of rent  the term rent refers to  payments made for 
factors of production which are in imperfectly elastic supply  By this definition  rent 
is applied to other factors like labour and capital  In other words  rent does not apply 
to land alone  Just as land differs in fertility  men differ in their ability  For example  a 
surgeon with a rare skill may earn a lot of income  There is an element of rent in it  In 
fact  we have a theory of profits known as  Rent theory of profits 
 
Marshall has introduced the concept of  Quasi-rent  with regard to machines 
and other man-made appliances  So the modern view is that rent can be applied to 
all factors of production  Whenever  the supply of a factor is inelastic in relation to the 
demand for it  rent arises 
To explain rent  modern economists also make use of the term transfer 
earnings  Transfer earnings refer to the amount that a factor could earn in its best 
paid alternative employment  It represents the opportunity cost of its present 
employment  Any payment in excess of this amount is a surplus above what is 
necessary to retain the factor in its best-paid employment and so is rent  Thus  any 
payment in excess of transfer earnings is economic rent  If a popular south Indian 
Cinema actor who is normally paid  say Rs two crores  gets an offer to act in a Hindi 
film for Rs  three crores  his transfer earnings are Rs  two crores  Rs  one crore may 
be considered as economic rent for acting in the Hindi film  So the main point about 
the modern theory of rent is that rent is not peculiar to land alone  The rent aspect 
can be seen in other factor incomes as well 
Quasi-Rent 
According to Marshall   Quasi-rent is the income derived from machines and 
other appliances for production by man 
There are some machines and other man-made appliances  e g  boats 
whose supply may be inelastic in the short run in relation to the demand for them 
For example  when there is large increase in demand for fish during a season  the 
demand for boats will increase  But you cannot increase their supply over night  So 
they will earn some extra income over and above the normal income they receive 
This  Marshall calls Quasi-rent  Quasi-rent will disappear  when once the supply of 
boats increases 
Wages 
Introduction 
Wages are the reward for labour  There are two main kinds of wages   
money wages and   real wages  Money wages are also known as nominal 
wages  Real wages refer to the commodities and services which the money wages 
command  They depend mainly on the purchasing power of money  which in turn 
depends upon the price level  The standard of living of workers in a country depends 
upon the real wages  Further  a farm worker may get low money wages  But if he 
gets free board and lodging  we must take that also into account while considering 
real wages 
Theories of wages 
There are many theories of wages  Some of the early theories of wages are 
    The Subsistence Theory of wages     The Standard of Living Theory     The 
Wages Fund Theory     The Residual Claimant Theory 
 
Some of the important recent theories of wages are 
  The Marginal productivity theory of wages  
  The Market theory of wages and 
  The Bargaining theory of wages 
Early theories of wages 
  The subsistence theory of wages   According to this theory  the wages 
that are paid to a worker must be just enough to cover his bare needs of 
subsistence  If the workers are paid less than the subsistence wage  there 
will be starvation and death and it will result in shortage of supply of labour 
Criticism   The main criticism against the theory is that it is based on the 
assumption that an increase in wages will result in an increase in population  Man is 
different from an animal  Besides bare needs  he needs some comforts  This theory 
does not take note of that  And it is one sided  It ignores the forces operating on the 
side of demand  This theory is based on bad ethics 
  The standard of living theory   This theory tells that wages depend upon the 
standard of living of workers 
Criticism   There is no doubt that the standard of living theory is an 
improvement on the subsistence theory  It is true that there is relationship between 
standard of living and wages  But it is rather difficult to say which is the cause and 
which is the result 
  The Wages Fund Theory   According to Wages Fund Theory   wages depend 
upon the proportion between population and capital  The term  capital  in 
the context refers to the fund set apart for payment of wages  And the word 
 population  refers to workers  If the supply of workers increases  wages will 
fall and vice versa 
Criticism   The theory assumes that an increase in wages will result in an 
increase in population  But there is no direct relationship between the two  Further 
it tells that if wages rise  profits will fall  This is not correct because during periods of 
good trade  both wages and profits will rise 
  The Residual Claimant Theory   According to this theory  wages  equal the 
whole product minus rent  interest and profits   Walker  In other words 
the theory tells that wages are paid out of the residue that is left over after 
making payment for rent  interest and profits 
Criticism   The main criticism against the theory is that it considers wages as 
residual payment  But wages are in the nature of advance payment and they have to 
be paid first  Normally  profits are taken at the end 
 
Recent Theories of wages 
  The Marginal productivity theory of wages   The marginal productivity 
theory of wages is only an application of the marginal productivity theory 
of distribution  which is a general theory of distribution  The theory explains 
how wages are determined under conditions of perfect competition 
According to the marginal productivity theory  wages will be equal to the 
value of the marginal product of labour 
As an employer goes on employing more and more units of labour  its 
marginal product will fall because of the law of diminishing marginal returns  So he 
will employ labour upto the point where the wages he pays are equal to the value 
of the marginal product of labour  All units are assumed to be uniform  So the 
productivity of the marginal unit of labour determines the rate at which wages are to 
be paid to all units of labour 
Criticism   Every product is produced by the joint effort of all factors of 
production  It is rather difficult to measure the productivity of each factor in terms of 
the product produced  The difficulty is more in measuring the marginal productivity 
of those who render services  eg  doctors  actors and lawyers      it is based on 
the assumption of perfect competition  But in the real world  we have only imperfect 
competition     under monopoly  wages will be lower than the marginal product of 
labour because there is exploitation of labour     wages are in the nature of advance 
payment  So an employer will deduct some amount to cover the interest on capital 
and pay the workers wages which are lower than their marginal product  So wages 
are the discounted marginal product of labour   The theory should not be used to 
justify the low wages in an economy and the inequalitites of incomes  Wages might 
be low because of exploitation of labour  In spite of the above criticism   the doctrine 
throws into clear light the action of one of the causes that govern wages   Marshall 
The Market Theory of Wages 
The market theory looks at wages as the price of labour  Like all other prices 
wages are determined by the market forces of supply and demand 
The supply of labour generally refers to the total number of people available 
for employment  Some types of labour require long periods of training  During that 
long period  workers have to sacrifice their earnings  We have to take note of the 
foregone earnings while estimating the cost of labour which determines its supply 
The demand for labour 
Demand for labour is a derived demand  Modern production is carried on 
largely on the basis of anticipation of demand for goods  During good trade  demand 
for labour will be more  Again  if capital is cheap  the employer will try to substitute 
capital for labour  When there is increase in investment  there will be increase in 
demand for labour 
 
In a competitive labour market  equilibrium will be established at the wage that 
equates the demand for labour with the supply of labour

and wages are represented up the Y axis  Wages are determined  OW  at that point 
 E  where the demand for labour is equal to the supply of labour  ON 
If demand for labour is high relative to its supply  wages will be high and vice 
versa  On the supply side  there are many imperfections  There is geographical 
immobility of labour  There may be shortage in the supply of certain categories of 
labour  eg  doctors  engineers  In some industries  the supply of labour is controlled 
by trade unions 
The Bargaining Theory of Wages 
The bargaining theory of wages takes note of the influence of trade unions on 
wages through collective bargaining  According to the theory  the level of wages in 
an industry depends on the bargaining strength of the trade union concerned  The 
strength of a trade union depends upon many things like the size of its membership 
the size of its  fighting fund  and its ability to cause dislocation in the industry and 
the economy through strike  During periods of full employment and good trade  trade 
unions will be in a strong position and during depression marked by bad trade and 
mass unemployment  trade unions will be in a weak position 
A trade union may increase wages by restricting the supply of labour  For 
example  it may insist that only members of a trade union should be employed  This 
is known as closed shop policy  It may threaten that it will go on strike if a minimum 
wage is not paid 
 
Interest 
Interest is the price paid for the use of capital  This is  net interest  or  pure 
interest  A good example of pure interest is the interest we get on some government 
securities  It may be regarded as net interest  Gross interest  includes besides net 
interest  other things such as reward for risk  remuneration for incovenience and 
payment for services  Thus gross interest covers trade risks and personal risks  For 
example  when a money lender lends money to an Indian farmer  he charges high 
rate of interest because there is the risk of non - payment of the amount borrowed 
There are trade risks and personal risks  Generally  people prefer to have cash 
balances  This is known as liquidity preference  When you lend money to someone 
you cannot get it for sometime  And that is incovenience  So to compensate it  one 
must be paid some extra income  So  gross interest includes compensation for all the 
above things besides net interest 
Theories of Interest 
Some of the theories of interest are   The Abstinence or Waiting Theory 
of Interest     The Agio Theory and Time Preference Theory     The Marginal 
Productivity Theory     Saving and Investment Theory  The classical theory   
Loanable Funds Theory and   The Liquidity Preference Theory 
According to the Abstinence theory of Nassau Senior  interest is the reward 
for abstaining from the immediate consumption of wealth  When people save  they 
abstain from present consumption  That involves some sacrifice  To make them 
save  interest is offered as a reward  But Marshall preferred the word   waiting  to 
 absitinence 
The  Agio theory of interest of Bohm-Bawerk tells that as the present carries a 
premium  agio  over the future  and as people prefer present consumption to future 
consumption  we have to pay a price for them by way of compensation  And that is 
interest  The time preference theory of Irving Fisher is more or less the same as Agio 
theory of interest  The marginal productivity theory of distribution is nothing but the 
application of the marginal productivity theory of distribution  It tells that interest tends 
to equal the marginal productivity of capital 
The classical theory of interest tells that the rate of interest is determined by 
the supply of capital which depends upon savings and the demand for capital for 
investment  The theory is based on the assumption that there is a direct relationship 
between the rate of interest  savings and direct relationship between interest and 
investment  The classical economists believed that savings would increase when the 
interest rates were high  and investment would increase with a fall in interest rate 
And the equilibrium between saving and investment was brought about by the rate of 
interest 
 
Loanable funds theory  Neo   classical theory  of Interest 
The loanable funds theory was developed by Knut Wicksell  Dennis Robertson 
and others  The loanable funds theory is wider in its scope than the classical theory 
of interest  The term  loanable funds  includes not only saving out of current income 
but also bank credit  dishoarding and disinvestments  But by saving  the classical 
economists referred only to saving out of current income  We know now that bank 
credit is an important source of funds for investment 
In the classical theory  saving was demanded only for investment  But 
according to loanable funds theory  the demand for funds arose  not only for 
investment but also for hoarding wealth 
The classical theory regarded interest as a function of saving and investment 
 r   f  S I  But  according to loanable funds theory  the rate of interest is a function 
of four variables  i e r   f  I S M L  where r is the rate of interest  I   investment  S  
saving  M   bank credit and L   desire to hoard or the desire for liquidity 
In Fig    The Curve  S  represents savings  the curve  M  represents bank 
credit  including dishoarded and disinvested wealth  The curve S   M represents 
total loanable funds at different rates of interest 
On the demand side  the curve I represents demand for investment  The 
curve L represents demand for idle cash balances or to hoard money  The curve I 
  L represents the total demand for loanable funds at different rates of interest  The 
market rate of interest rm is determined by the intersection of S   M curve and I   L 
curve  The aggregate demand for loanable funds is equal to the aggregate supply of 
loanable funds at this rate of interest  In the classical theory  rn which may be called 
the natural rate of interest is determined by the intersection of I and S curves  That 
is  when the rate of interest is rn  the demand for investment is equal to the supply of 
savings 
 
Criticism   There is no doubt that loanable funds theory is an improvement 
over the classical theory of interest  It has been criticized on the ground that it 
assumes that saving is a function of the rate of interest     it ignores the influence of 
the changes in the level of investment on employment  income and on savings 
Liquidity preference theory  Keynesian theory  of interest 
Generally people prefer to hold a part of their assets in the form of cash  Cash 
is a liquid asset  According to Keynes  interest is the reward for parting with liquidity 
for a specified period of time  In other words  it is the reward for not hoarding 
According to Keynes  people have liquidity preference for three motives  They 
are   Transaction motive    Precautionary motive  and   Speculative motive 
The transaction motive refers to the money held to finance day to day 
spending  Precautionary money is held to meet an unforeseen expenditure 
Keynes defines speculative motive as  the object of securing profit from 
knowing better than the market what the future will bring forth  Of the three motives 
speculative motive is more important in determining the rate of interest  Keynes 
believed that the amount of money held for speculative motive would vary inversely 
with the rate of interest 
Keynes was of the view that the rate of interest was determined by liquidity 
preference on the one hand and the supply of money on the other

In fig    Liquidity preference is shown by L and the supply of money 
is represented by M and the rate of interest is indicated by r  Rate of interest is 
determined by the intersection of L and M curves  There will be increase in the rate of 
interest to r 
  when there is increase in demand for money to L 
 or by a decrease in 
the supply of money to M 
  
Criticism   Keynesian theory is a general theory of interest and it is far superior 
to the earlier theories of interest  But critics say that Keynes has over - emphasized 
liquidity preference factor in the theory of interest  Moreover  only when a person  
 
has savings  the question of parting with liquidity arises  In the words of Jacob Viner 
 without saving  there can be no liquidity to surrender  The rate of interest is the 
return for  saving without liquidity 
Profits 
Profits are the reward for organization or entrepreneurship  Risk- taking and 
uncertainty-bearing are the main functions of an entrepreneur  So we may consider 
profit as the reward for the above functions 
Gross Profit   Generally when we speak of profit  we refer to the difference 
between the total expenses of producing a good and the total revenue from it  But 
this is gross profit 
Gross Profit and Net Profit   Gross profit includes besides net profit other 
things such as the interest on capital  rent of land  wages of manangement and some 
extra income on account of the monopoly position of a firm  It also includes some 
chance gains  windfall profits  While considering net profit  or  pure profit  we have 
to deduct all the above things from gross profit  Net profit is the reward for risk - 
taking and uncertainty - bearing which are the main functions of an entrepreneur  The 
monopolist is the sole seller of a commodity for which there are no substitutes  As he 
controls the supply  it is possible for him to make huge profits  And this is known as 
monopoly profit 
Normal profit and super normal profit  excess profit 
Pure profit  net profit  can be divided into normal profit and supernormal 
profit  Normal profit is the minimum necessary to guarantee that an entrepreneur 
will continue to bear uncertainty and run the firm  That part of pure profit which is in 
excess of normal profit is excess or surplus profit or supernormal profit  Though firms 
under perfect competition may make surplus profits in the short run  it will disappear 
in the long run  Only a monopoly can earn excess profits indefinitely 
The early economists made no distinction between interest and profits 
because they considered the capitalist and the entrepreneur as one and the 
same person  The entrepreneur need not necessarily be the owner of capital  It is 
leadership rather than ownership that is important in the case of an entrepreneur 
Today  organization has become a distinct factor of production  Profits differ from 
other incomes in three ways  First  it is a residual income  Second  there may be wide 
fluctuations in profits and sometimes  they may be negative  That is  there may be 
losses  We cannot think of negative wages  Third  profits are uncertain 
Theories of Profit 
Some of the important theories of profit are   the rent theory of profits  
The marginal productivity theory of profits     The wages theory of profits     the 
dynamic theory of profits     the innovation theory of profits   the risk theory of 
profits  and   the uncertainty   bearing theory of profits 
 
Rent theory of profits 
  Prof walker is the author of the rent theory of profits  In his view  profits 
are the  rent of ability  and they are similar to rent  Rent arises because of 
differences in fertility of land  Similarly profits arise because of differences in 
ability  That is why it is called the  rent of ability  The main criticism against 
this theory is that it explains only why there are differences in profits  It does 
not answer the fundamental question why there are profits as such 
  The Marginal productivity theory of profits   The theory is an application of 
the general theory of distribution  According to this theory  under perfect 
competition  profits will be equal to the value of the marginal product of 
organization  We can apply all the criticisms against marginal productivity 
theory to this theory also 
  The wages theory of Profits   According to Prof  Taussig  profits are not 
different from wages  Profits  are the wages of the entrepreneur for his 
special ability  Profits are the wages of management  The criticism against 
the theory is that we can speak of negative profits  losses  but we cannot 
speak of negative wages  Organization is a distinct factor of production  And 
it is different from labour 
  The Dynamic Theory of profits  Prof  Clark is the author of this theory 
According to him  profits are the result of dynamic changes in society  Clark 
has defined profits as the excess of the prices of goods over their costs 
Some of the important changes relate to the size of population  supply of 
capital  production techniques  industrial organization and human wants 
Though the dynamic theory is one of the modern theories of profits   it 
overlooks the fundamental question of the difference between a change that 
is foreseen a reasonable time in advance and one that is unforeseen 
  Innovation theory of profits  According to Schumpeter  profits are the 
reward for innovations  An innovation is something more than an invention 
An invention becomes an innovation only when it is applied to industrial 
processes  Innovation includes introduction of new goods  or new methods 
of production and opening new market  And innovations are introduced by 
the entrepreneur  Change and economic development take place because 
of his activities  So he gets profits for innovations  The criticism against the 
theory is that though innovation is an important factor in the emergence of 
profits  it cannot be the only factor  It ignores the risk-bearing function of the 
entrepreneur 
  The Risk - bearing theory of profits  - According to Prof  Hawley  profits are 
the reward for an entrepreneur for risk- taking  Risk - taking is an important 
function of an entrepreneur  Risk-taking and profit-making go together  The  
 
main criticism against this theory is that it does not make distinction between 
known risks and unknown risks  Known risks  eg  theft  fire  can be insured 
against  We may say that profits are the reward for taking unknown risks  For 
there is a lot of uncertainty about such risks 
  The uncertainity-bearing theory of profits   Professor Knight is the author 
of the uncertainty - bearing theory of profits  He is of the view that  profit is 
the reward not for risk - bearing but uncertainty- bearing  His main point is 
that there is risk because future is uncertain  And uncertainty - bearing is an 
essential function of an entrepreneur 
The entrepreneur can insure known risks  But unknown risks  eg  competition 
risks  risks of government action  cannot be insured against  These risks are 
uncertain  The entrepreneur earns profits because uncertainties are borne by him 
The criticism against the theory is that uncertainty - bearing alone is not the only 
function of an entrepreneur 
Conclusion   The main defect with all the above theories is that they 
stress only one or two functions of the entrepreneur  In addition to risk-taking and 
uncertainty-bearing  the entrepreneur performs a number of other functions  And he 
deserves reward in the form of profits

Chapter  
Simple Theory of Income Determination 
Adam Smith  -  Thomas Malthus  -  David Ricardo  - 
  and Jean-Baptist Say  -  were the most prominent classical 
economists  Their thinking on the macro economic issues  such as income and 
unemployment  has mostly been shaped by their time and circumstances of  th 
and  th centuries  But their ideas have also influenced the thinking of subsequent 
generations 
Their idea of how free market would solve unemployment was widely 
accepted until the Great Depression of  s  The Great Depression crippled the 
free enterprise economies of US and UK with high level of unemployment and glut 
in the market  J M  Keynes  -   after having examined the depression 
had revolutionized the macro economic thinking through his writings  His ideas have 
made greater impact on governments and their role in solving unemployment until 
recent times  His ideas underlie all modern macro economic theories 
Classical Theory of Full Employment 
The classical economists believed that the productive capacity of a country 
decides how much to be produced  An economy produces as much as it can  It 
assumes the existence of full employment  It has not thought of unemployment of any 
factor of production  particularly labour  The confidence that market makes it possible 
to sell everything that is produced is based upon Say s law  Say s Law of market is a 
denial of the possibility of general over-production or mass unemployment deficiency 
of aggregate demand in a free economy 
Say s Law of Market 
J  B  Say  a French economist  propounded his law of markets in his book 
 Treatise on Political Economy    His law can be summarized as  supply 
creates its own demand  This means that production of every good generates 
sufficient income to ensure that there is enough demand for the goods produced 
Every production which brings goods to market does so only in order to 
exchange them for other goods  It precisely states that whatever be the level of 
output  and the income created by that will necessarily lead to an equal amount 
of spending and hence deficiency of aggregate demand cannot occur  Hence 
Say rejected the view that there could be general over-production and mass 
unemployment  Only full employment prevails in the economy  He made the following 
assumptions 
 
  All incomes of the households are spent on consumption of goods and services 
  There is no government activity  no taxation  public spending  price control etc 
  It is a closed economy i e  no relationship with other economies 
Whatever is produced represents the demand for another product  Additional 
supply is additional demand  Thus Say s analysis is carried on in terms of barter 
However  introduction of money in no way affects the process  In fact  moneybased 
economy is more efficient than barter economy  It is true that sometimes 
misdirected production may result in temporary over-supply of a particular product in 
a particular industry  Say himself admits this fact  But this disequilibrium disappears 
by the operation of the self-adjusting market forces  But general over- production or 
unemployment is impossible according to Say 
The essential aspects of Say s Law can be summarized as 
  Economy is self-adjusting 
  No general over-production or unemployment is possible 
  All idle resources are fully employed 
  There is economic interdependence between nations 
  Flexible wage rate prevails in the economy 
  Flexible rate of interest prevails in the economy 
  Money is simply a veil 
  It helps international trade and 
  No government interference is essential 
Criticism of Say s Law 
Keynes has clearly exposed the weakness of Say s law  In   Keynes 
brought about a revolution in economic theory attacking Say s law  In  s  Great 
Depression and its effects showed that the classical theory of employment was 
wrong and its foundation  the Say s Law was unacceptable  Keynes launched a 
vigorous attack on the Say s Law  The main points of criticism of the law are 
  Great Depression made Say s law unpopular 
  All incomes earned are not always spent on consumption 
  Similarly whatever is saved is not automatically invested 
  The Law was based on wrong analysis of market 
  It suffers from the fallacy of aggregation 
 
  Aggregate supply and aggregate demand are not always equal 
  Rate of interest is not the equilibrating factor 
  Capitalist system is not self-adjusting always 
  Perfect competition is an unrealistic assumption 
  Money is a dominant force in the economy 
  The law is applicable only for long period 
  Say s law holds goods only in a barter economy 
Say s law has no validity and use now  critics point out  However  the classical 
theory relied on Say s law to assure that there would always be full-employment as 
a result of equality between aggregate demand and aggregate supply  In short there 
cannot be deficiency of aggregate demand  Even if there is any unemployment  the 
market mechanism would restore full employment 
Keynesian Theory of Income Determination 
Keynes is considered to be the greatest economist of the  th century  He 
wrote several books  However  his  The General Theory of Employment  Interest 
and Money    won him everlasting fame in economics  The book revolutionized 
macro economic thought  Keynesian economics is called the Keynesian revolution 
The central problem in macro economics is the determination of income and 
employment of a nation as a whole  That is why modern economists also call macro 
economics as the theory of income determination  Keynes brings out all the important 
aspects of income and employment determination and Keynesian economics itself 
can be called macro economics He attacked the classical economics and effectively 
rejected the Say s Law  the very foundation of the classical theory  He believed 
that in the short run  the level of income of an economy depends on the level of 
employment  The higher the level of employment  higher will be the level of income 
A perusal of the basic ideas of Keynes can be clearly understood from the 
brief summary in the flow chart  Total income depends on total employment which 
depends on effective demand which in turn depends on consumption expenditure 
and investment expenditure  Consumption depends on income and propensity to 
consume  Investment depends upon the marginal efficiency of capital and the rate of 
interest

The Principle of Effective Demand 
The principle of effective demand occupies a key position in the Keynesian 
theory of employment  Effective demand is the ability and willingness to spend by 
individuals  firms and government  The level of output produced and hence the level 
of employment depends on the level of total spending in the economy 
Keynes used  aggregate demand and aggregate supply approach  to explain 
his simple theory of income determination  The term  aggregate  is used to describe 
any quantity that is a grand total for the whole economy 
 
Aggregate demand is the total demand for all commodities  goods and 
services  in the economy  Aggregate supply is the total of commodities supplied in 
the economy  These two factors are called by Keynes as aggregate demand function 
 ADF  and the aggregate supply function  ASF 
Keynes made it clear that the level of employment depends on aggregate 
demand and aggregate supply  The equilibrium level of income or output depends on 
the relationship between the aggregate demand curve and aggregate supply curve 
As Keynes was interested in the immediate problems of the short run  he ignored 
the aggregate supply function and focused on aggregate demand  And he attributed 
unemployment to deficiency in aggregate demand 
It is important to note that all demand is not effective  According to Keynes 
effective demand is that point where the ADF and ASF are equal  ASF represents 
cost and ADF represents receipts  Cost must not exceed receipt  When the 
entrepreneurs find that their receipts are less than their costs  they will stop offering 
employment to new workers  So long as their receipts are higher than the costs  they 
will increase employment as they can increase their profits by offering more and 
more employment 
As already mentioned  the point of intersection between the two curves shows 
the maximum possible employment  According to Keynes  the level of employment 
depends on total demand and unemployment results as a consequence of a fall in 
total demand  If unemployment is to be averted  the remedy lies in increasing the 
effective demand 
Aggregate Demand 
The total expenditure of an economy can be divided in to four categories 
of spending  They are consumption expenditure  C  investment expenditure  I 
government expenditure  G  and net expenditure on trade or net exports that is 
exports minus imports   X- M  The aggregate demand is the sum total of all such 
spending  Hence the aggregate demand function is represented as 
 AD   C  I   G    X-M     
This function shows that the aggregate demand is equal to the sum of 
expenditure respectively on consumption  C  Investment  I  Government spending 
 G  and net exports  X-M  Thus aaggregate demand is the total value of all 
planned expenditure of all buyers in the economy  It is the total demand for goods 
and services in the economy  Y  in a specific time period  Moreover  the aggregate 
demand is known as the amount of commodities people want to buy 
In the economy  as one man s expenditure is another man s income  the total 
expenditure of the economy must be equivalent to the total income  That is Total 
income Y    Total expenditure  AD  Since Y   AD  equation     can be written as 
 Y   AD   C  I   G    X-M 
 
or Y   C  I   G    X-M     
Keynes gives all attention to the ADF  This aspect was neglected by 
economists for over   years  Assuming that ASF is constant  the main basis of 
Keynesian theory is that employment depends on aggregate demand which itself 
depends on two factors 
  Propensity to consume  Consumption function 
  Inducement to invest  Investment function 
Consumption Function 
People spend most of their income on commodities  Some spend their income 
fully and some others spend a portion and keep the rest for saving  How much 
the community as a whole spends and saves  It is about the relationship between 
income and consumption 
The term  consumption function  explains the relationship between income and 
consumption  A function is the link between two or more variables  The proportion of 
income spent on actual consumption at different levels of income is called propensity 
to consume

Keynes made it clear that there is a direct relation between income and 
consumption  Consumption function or propensity to consume is the ratio that 
measures the functional relationship between income and consumption  In 
mathematical form the relation can be expressed as 
 C   a   b y        
 C        Y 
Thus a consumption function is generally described in terms of the  
 
linear equation Y   a   bY where the constant  a  is the amount of autonomous 
consumption and slope  b  is MPC  The rate of change in consumption due to 
change in income depends on the MPC 
Equation   simply says that consumption  C  depends on income  Y  The 
  sign indicates that as income increases  obviously consumption will also increase 
But the rate of increase in consumption will be little less than that of the rate of 
increase in income  It is because some unspent portion of the income will be saved 
This aspect is made clear in the Keynes law of consumption  He points out   the 
psychology of the community is such that when real income is increased  aggregate 
consumption is increased  but not so much as income    Keynes also made it clear 
that in the short run  the consumption function is stable because consumption habits 
of the people are more or less stable in short period 
All these points or the income-consumption relationship can also be expressed 
in Figure   The vertical axis shows the spending on consumption indicated by 
C and the horizontal axis shows income or output indicated by Y  The straight line 
consumption function CC is defined in terms of equation C        Y 
The consumption curve CC is a short run curve  In this case consumption 
takes place even when income is zero  In equation     is the level of initial 
consumption when income is zero and it is not affected by income  Even when 
income is zero  people spend some minimum level either by gift or borrowing  This 
consumption which is not related to income is called as autonomous consumption 
That is the reason why curve C starts from   on the vertical axis 
In equation     indicates that   per cent of additional income is spent on 
consumption and it is called as marginal propensity to consume  MPC  Thus MPC is 
the ratio of change in consumption to change in income  In other words  MPC is the 
rate of change in propensity to consume 
Change in consumption MPC   Change in income 
Or MPC     C 
 Y 
Where  C - Change in consumption and  Y - Change in income 
The slope of the consumption function or any other straight line is measured 
by dividing the vertical change by horizontal change  The symbol   represents a 
change  Or slope can also be calculated as 
Vertical change Slope   Horizontal change 
The propensity to consume is assumed to be stable in the short run  Therefore 
out of the given income how much will be spent depends on the slope of the curve 
 
In our case    indicates that out of every additional income earned eighty per 
cent will be spent for consumption keeping the rest for saving  In short  consumption 
function relates the amount of consumption to level of income  Thus consumption of 
an economy depends upon the level of income  When the income of an economy 
rises  consumption also rises and vice versa  Suppose people spend more in an 
economy in relation to their income  their MPC will be more 
Keynesian Law of Consumption implies the following three aspects  Thus 
the concept of consumption function plays a vital role in Keynesian income 
determination 
  Increase in income and increase in consumption are not at the same proportion 
Consumption function is positive but less than one 
  An increase in income is shared between consumption and saving 
  Increase in income will not cause rise in consumption and saving at the same 
time  If the rate of increase in savings rises  the rate of increase in consumption 
will fall 
Saving Function 
The portion of the income not spent on consumption is saving  Saving is 
consumption forgone  If saving rises  consumption will fall  According to Keynes 
the level of saving in the economy  like consumption  depends basically on income 
The relationship between saving and income can mathematically be expressed as in 
equation     and that is called as saving function 
 S   -a   by 
 S   -      Y        
 Where S   Saving   Y - Income  -a   dis-savings 
Marginal Propensity to save  MPS  is the ratio of saving to a change in 
income  Thus it is the rate of change in the propensity to save 
 
Where  s - Change in saving and  Y - Change in income 
With an increase income  if MPC tends to fall  MPS will tend to rise  If 
MPC remains constant  MPS also will remain constant  Thus income consists of 
consumption and saving 
Hence Y   C   S 
Or MPC   MPS    
 MPS       MPC or 
 MPC       MPS 
 
In an economy where people spend less of their additional income  MPC 
will be less and the CC curve will be less steep  Note that the constant  -a  is dissaving 
because it is autonomous consumption which is unrelated to income  The 
autonomous consumption will became zero in the long run  That is  households 
cannot consume without income in the long run  Hence in the long run  the 
consumption purely depends upon income and the curve C starts from origin 
Other Determinants of Consumption 
Though income is the most important factor that has greater influence on 
consumption  there are other factors which influence the propensity to consume 
They are 
  Income distribution 
  Size and nature of wealth distribution 
  Age distribution of population 
  Inflation or price level 
  Government policies 
  Rate of interest 
  Expectations about price  income  etc 
  Advertisements 
  Improvement in the living standard 
  Changes in cultural values 
As discussed earlier  aggregate demand consists of two parts  if you ignore 
government and external trade  namely consumption function and investment 
function  However  consumption function or MPC remains constant in the short run 
Hence  Keynes placed greater emphasis on investment function 
Investment Function 
Investment has a specific meaning in economics  It means additions to 
the existing productive capacities  stock of fixed capital and inventories  They 
include fixed equipments  machinery  building  raw materials  replacement due to 
depreciation  etc  It lays down the basis for future production  Investment is the key 
structural component of total spending or aggregate spending 
By investment  Keynes means real investment and not financial investment 
Investment is the addition to real capital assets  It does not mean the purchase of 
bonds or shares which are financial investment  The distinction between consumption 
and investment is fundamental in Keynesian theory  Importance of investment 
as a component of aggregate demand rises due to the fact that it is another major 
component 
 
Consumption is a stable function of income  So it was not possible to 
change aggregate demand by changing consumption expenditure as it depends on 
income  Keynes found that investment is an autonomous expenditure determined 
independently of the level of income  He found it to be the major cause for the 
variation and instability in income and employment  The worldwide depression of 
 s was also caused by a fall in investment 
Determinants of Investment 
According to Keynes  employment depends on investment  Employment 
fluctuates on account of fluctuations in investment  Therefore  we must discuss what 
determines the amount of investment  Investment spending is determined by 
  Expectations of future profitability or business confidence and 
  Rate of interest 
Firms invest either from their own profits or by borrowing  Households having 
saving  have to decide whether to invest the money for profit or lend deposit for 
interest  If the expected profit is higher than the rate of interest  then the households 
will invest  Otherwise they will lend or deposit their money for interest  Firms who 
invest their own profit will also decide in the same manner  Suppose the firms 
borrow for investment  then they have to pay interest for that  Hence  firms will invest 
borrowed money only when the expected profit is high enough to pay the interest and 
the cost of initial capital 
Thus  in all the above cases  the decision to invest will be based on the rate of 
interest and business confidence  Of these two  business confidence or expectations 
about future profitability has got greater significance than the rate of interest  This is 
because rate of interest is stable in the short run  The expectations about profitability 
involves several considerations of the future about which there cannot be any 
certainty  Bleak prospects will lead to a reduction of investment and it will affect 
employment and vice versa 
Savings and Investment 
Another important concept in this regard is savings  It is directly connected 
with investment  Saving and investment are the basic economic activities of an 
economy  Saving is inevitable for capital formation and economic growth  Saving 
itself has nothing to do with economic growth unless savings are properly mobilized 
and effectively channelised and invested to enhance capital stock to increase 
production and wealth of the economy  Thus aggregate savings and investment are 
equal 
But they may not be always in equilibrium  The classical economists believed 
that savings were automatically invested  They thought the decisions to save and 
the decisions to invest were made by the same persons  But Keynes argued that 
saving and investment were made by different persons for different reasons and were  
 
influenced by different factors  Thus  sometimes savings might exceed investment 
When this happened  there would be deficiency of aggregate demand and general 
unemployment 
Keynes thought the gap between S and I could be filled by government 
intervention either directly by increasing government expenditure or indirectly by 
actions influencing the supply of money 
 Thus S   I 
 Therefore Y   C   I 
 Or Y   C   S 
Rate of interest  Liquidity Preference Theory 
Any business move has to take into consideration a vital factor which 
influences the current supply of money  namely interest  The rate of interest is 
another major determinant that influences aggregate investment  In fact  the 
Keynesian theory of employment begins with the rate of interest  Interest affects 
investment and employment  Keynes propounded his famous liquidity preference 
theory of interest to explain the necessity  justification and importance of interest 
The concept of liquidity preference is a remarkable contribution of Keynes  According 
to Keynes  the rate of interest is  the reward for parting with liquidity for a specified 
period 
Liquidity preference refers to the cash holdings of the people  Liquidity means 
cash  Why do people hold cash  It is because money is the most liquid asset and 
people prefer to keep their wealth in the form of cash  Keynes gives three motives for 
the liquidity preference of the people  They are 
  Transaction motive 
  Precautionary motive and 
  Speculative motive 
In order to carry on day-to-day transactions  people prefer to keep cash  It is 
governed by the transaction motive  To meet unforeseen expenditure like sudden 
medical expenses  people hold cash  It is determined by precautionary motive 
To take advantage of market movements of prices of bonds  shares  etc  people 
keep cash and in this case the speculative motive determines their cash holdings 
 Speculative motive refers to the object of securing profit from knowing better than 
the market what the future will bring forth   Keynes 
Liquidity preference depends on rate of interest  Higher the rate of interest 
people would like to take advantage and so will part with their cash  Therefore 
we can say that higher the rate of interest  lower will be the liquidity preference of 
the people  On the other hand  lower the rate of interest  higher will be the liquidity 
preference 
 
According to Keynes  the liquidity preference is more stable as it depends on 
human habits which remain same  Liquidity preference relates to the demand for 
money  It is important to note that it influences the demand side in determining the 
price of capital   The other side is the supply of money which depends on government 
monetary policy  and credit creation by commercial banks 
Briefly stated  the Keynesian investment function gives immense importance 
to the rate of interest  If the rate of interest remains constant  then investment 
increases with an increase in the business confidence about the future 
Simple Income Determination 
According to Keynes  the level of income of a country in the short run will 
change as a result of change in employment  The level of employment depends on 
aggregate demand and aggregate supply  The equilibrium level of income depends 
on the balance between aggregate demand and aggregate supply  Full employment 
prevails when there is equality between these two  Thus the model can be used to 
show the determination of income  output and employment 
Assumptions 
Keynes made the following assumption to explain income determination in a 
simple way 
  There are only two sectors viz  consumers   C   and firms   I  
  Government influence on the economy is nil  In other words government 
expenditure   G   is zero  As there is no taxation  all personal income will 
become disposable income 
  The economy is a closed one without any influence of foreign trade  X-M  that is 
X-M is zero 
  Wages and prices remain constant 
  There are unemployed resources and hence less than full employment 
equilibrium prevails 
  There is no variation in the rate of interest 
  Investment is autonomous and it has no effect on price level or rate of interest 
  The consumption expenditure is stable 
Due to the first three assumptions the basic equation 
 Y   C   I   G   X-M 
 has been reduced to Y   C   I 
In Figure   vertical axis measures total or aggregate demand  or 
aggregate expenditure  Horizontal axis measures income and output  You have  
 
learnt in National Income lesson  Plus One  that in the aggregate economy  income 
expenditure and output are equal  Hence they are measured in the same axis 
Aggregate supply is the total value of all commodities that the firms intend to 
supply  produce  This purely depends on available technology  resources  material 
and human  efficiency of labour  etc  Most of these factors change only in the long 
run and remain constant in the short run  As the aggregate supply curve represents 
equality of total income and output  the  -degree line is drawn from the origin 
representing AS curve  The  -degree line divides the quadrant into two equal halves 
with equal distance from the two axes  Every point on the line indicates equal amount 
of income  output and expenditure   Y   E   The importance of this is that if any other 
line intersects the  -degree line  the point of intersection will show an equal amount 
of income  output and expenditure 
Aggregate demand represents the total expenditure on consumption and 
investment  or total expenditure  The aggregate demand  expenditure  curve is the 
combination of consumption and investment function  In Figure   C represents 
consumption function  When investment is added  it becomes C I  The value of 
investment is shown by the vertical distance between C and C I curves 
Thus Aggregate Expenditure  AD    C   I 
Equilibrium occurs at the point of intersection of aggregate demand and 
aggregate supply  At point E the planned total spending  or aggregate demand  by 
consumers  C   and investors   I   is equal to the total amount of national income 
  Y   C   I   The equilibrium level of output also determines the equilibrium level 
of employment  Hence  at point E  we get equilibrium level of income  output and 
employment 
 
The equilibrium level of employment need not correspond to full employment 
If any of the components of aggregate demand rises at each level of income  for 
example  because government increases its expenditure  that shifts the entire AD line 
upward  This raises equilibrium income and output  Similarly  if any one component of 
AD falls  that shifts the line downward and lowers equilibrium output 
Multiplier  Ultimate determinant of Income and Employment 
We have dealt with the immediate determinants of income and employment 
namely  consumption spending and investment spending  C I  Among them 
autonomous consumption and investment are not related to income  The ultimate 
determinant of income and employment is the multiplier  Any increase in investment 
increases income manifold due to multiplier effect  Thus the concept of multiplier 
expresses the relationship between an initial investment and the final increment in 
the GNP  That is  the magnified or amplified effect of initial investment on income is 
called as the multiplier effect  It is measured by the ratio of change in equilibrium 
income to change in expenditure 
change in equilibrium income 
Multiplier  K    change in expenditure 
 Y Or K    I 
whereas DY - change in equilibrium income  DI - change in expenditure 
Thus  K is the co-efficient that shows the number of times at which income 
increased due to increase in investment  K can also be calculated by another way 
K    
MPS where MPS   marginal propensity to save 
or 
K    
  - MPC where MPC   marginal propensity to consume 
Government Spending 
We have discussed the simple income determination only with two kinds of 
expenditure  One is consumption expenditure  C  to produce consumer goods 
Second is investment expenditure  I  to produce capital goods  The third component 
is the public expenditure  G  made by government  It is made to produce public 
goods like literacy  public health  child nutrition  social welfare and many more for the 
collective well-being of the society 
The classical economists held the view that government was unproductive 
Keynes rejected their idea and argued that government activities  taxing and 
spending  strongly influence the level of economy  Taxation and public spending can 
be used to achieve macro goals like growth and economic stability  Such usage is 
called fiscal policy 
 
Keynes proved that fiscal policy is more effective in recovering economies 
from depression  Public expenditure can be used to increase effective demand during 
depression  The injection of money in the economy will generate demand and this 
will increase investment and employment  Thus public expenditure will put back the 
economy again on its growth path 
Many countries have adopted his policy suggestions and recovered from 
the Great Depression of  s  Since then the role of government and fiscal policy 
became important in macroeconomic management 
Principle of Acceleration 
According to the theory of multiplier  the increase in investment generates 
manifold increase in income  Such increases in income increases consumption  The 
initial increase in demand automatically gathers momentum  The available productive 
capacities will be exhausted fully  This in turn encourages more investment to meet 
the expanding demand  As the existing productive capacity would not be enough 
to meet the expanding demand  productive capacities will be expanded by new 
investments 
Thus the level of investment depends upon the rate of change in income 
and the resultant change in consumption  This is what called as the principle of 
accelerator  According to this principle  net investment is positively related to changes 
in income 
The theory of multiplier states the effect of investment upon the level of 
income  The principle of accelerator states that the effect of an increase in income 
upon the level of investment 
Money and Interest 
Keynes represented a monetary theory of interest  It is known as the liquidity 
preference theory of interest  Interest  according to Keynes  is payment for the use 
of money  The demand for money  liquidity preference  and the supply of money 
determine the rate of interest  The essence of the Keynesian theory of liquidity 
preference is that the quantity of money  along with the state of liquidity preference 
determines the rate of interest 
Keynes made it clear that interest is not the reward for savings as assumed by 
the classical writers  The rate of interest is the  reward for parting with liquidity for a 
period  In other words  the rate of interest is largely determined by the attitude of the 
people to part with liquidity if their liquidity preference is strong

Chapter  
Monetary Policy 
Introduction 
Before we study monetary policy  we shall study about the nature and 
functions of money  Money has become so important that the modern economy is 
described as money economy  Modern economy cannot work without money  Even 
in the early stages of development  the need for exchange arose  But exchange took 
place first in the form of barter  Barter is the direct exchange of goods for goods 
It is a system of trading without the use of money  In the past when wants of men 
were a few and simple  the barter system worked well  But as days passed by  it was 
found to be unsuitable  It had many difficulties  For example  barter requires double 
coincidence of wants  That is  a person must have what the other person wants 
and vice versa  And this is not always possible  For instance  if a person who has a 
cow wants a horse in exchange  the other person must have it and he must need a 
cow  Otherwise exchange cannot take place  Again  there is the difficulty of storage 
Money serves as a store of value  In the absence of money  a person has to store his 
wealth in the form of commodities and they cannot be stored for a long period  For 
some commodities are perishables and some will lose their value 
  Functions of Money 
Money has overcome the difficulties of barter  Crowther  has defined money 
as  anything that is generally acceptable as a means of exchange  i e  as a means of 
settling debts  and that at the same time acts as a measure and as a store of value 
An important point about this definition is that it regards anything that is generally 
acceptable as money  Thus money includes coins  currency notes  cheques  bills 
of exchange  credit cards and so on  That is why prof  Walker has said   money is 
that which money does  By this  he has referred to the functions of money  Money 
performs many functions in a modern economy  The most important functions of 
money are given in the form of a couplet quoted below  - 
 Money is a matter of functions four 
A medium  a measure  a standard  a store 
Thus  money  is a medium of exchange  a measure of value  a store of value 
and a standard of deferred payments 
  Medium of exchange   The most important function of money is that it acts as 
medium of exchange  Money is accepted freely in exchange for all other goods 
Barter system is very inconvenient  So the introduction of money has got over 
the difficulty of barter 
 
  Measure of value   Money acts as a common measure of value  It is a unit 
of account and a standard of measurement  Whenever we buy a good in the 
market we pay a price for it in money  And price is nothing but value expressed 
in terms of money  So we can measure the value of a good by the money we 
pay for it  Just as we use yards and metres for measuring length and kilograms 
for measuring weights  we use money for measuring the value of goods  It 
makes economic calculations easy 
  Store of value   A man who wants to store his wealth in some convenient form 
will find money admirably suitable for the purpose  It acts as a store of value 
Suppose the wealth of a man consists of a thousand cattle  It is rather difficult 
for him to preserve his wealth in the form of cattle  But if there is money  he can 
sell his cattle  get money for that and can store his wealth in the form of money 
  Standard of deferred payments   Money is used as a standard for future 
 deferred  payments  It forms the basis for credit transactions  Business in 
modern times is based on credit to a large extent  This is facilitated by the 
existence of money  In credit  since payment is made at a future date  there 
must be some medium which will have as far as possible the same exchange 
power in the future as at present  If credit transactions were to be carried on the 
basis of commodities  there would be a lot of difficulties and it will affect trade 
Money  to be used as a medium of exchange  must be universally acceptable 
All people must accept a thing as money  Or  the Government should give it legal 
sanction  And for performing the other two functions  that is  to be used as a store of 
value and standard of deferred payments  money should have stability of value  In 
other words  the value of money should not change often 
Importance of Money   Money is one of the most fundamental inventions of 
mankind  Every branch of knowledge has its fundamental discovery  In mechanics  it 
is the wheel  in science fire  in politics the vote  Similarly in economics  in the whole 
commercial side of Man s social existence  money is the essential invention on which 
all the rest is based  Crowther 
Money is indispensable in an economy whether it is capitalistic or socialistic 
Price mechanism plays a vital role in capitalism  Production  distribution and 
consumption are influenced to a great extent by prices  and prices are measured in 
money  Even a socialist economy  where the price system does not play so important 
a role as under capitalism  cannot do without money  For a while  the socialists talked 
of ending the money  i e  abolishing money itself  because they considered money as 
an invention of the capitalists to suppress the working class  But later on they found 
that even under a system of planning  economic accounting would be impossible 
without the help of money 
 
In the early stages of civilization  different people used different things as 
money  Cattle  tobacco  shells  wheat  tea  salt  knives  leather  animals such as 
sheep  horses and oxen and metals like iron  lead  tin and copper have been used 
as money  Gradually precious metals such as gold and silver replaced other metals 
such as iron  copper and bronze as money  And now paper is used as money  We 
may describe one more form of money  that is  bank deposits which go from person 
to person by means of cheques 
Money supply 
The Reserve Bank of India  RBI  is the central bank of our country  It manages 
the monetary system of our country  It has classified the money supply of our country 
into four components 
They are  
M    Currency with the public  It includes coins and currency notes   demand 
deposits of the public  M 
 is also known as narrow money  
M 
   M 
   post office savings deposits  
M    M    Time deposits of the public with the banks  M  is also known as broad 
money   and 
M    M    total post office deposits 
Note   Besides savings deposits  people maintain fixed deposits of different maturity 
periods with the post office 
Reserve Money 
Reserve Money  RM  may be considered as Government money   In this 
context  the Reserve Bank of India  RBI  is also taken as Government  Reserve 
money is the cash held by the public and the banks 
It is composed of 
C   currency with the public in circulation 
OD   other deposits of the public with the RBI  OD   The public regard their deposits 
with the RBI as cash or money  and 
CR   cash reserves of banks  Cash reserves are composed of two parts  - They are 
  cash reserves with banks themselves and   Bankers deposits with RBI 
Thus 
Reserve Money  RM    C  OD   CR 
 
We may note that the simple theory of money supply states that supply 
of money  M  is an increasing function of reserve money  RM  In other words  as 
Reserve Money changes  supply of money also changes 
The Reserve money is also called high powered money on account of its great 
influence on money supply 
Fiat Money   Currency notes in circulation are normally referred to as fiat money  For 
example  one Rupee notes issued by the Government of India is Fiat money 
The notes issued by the RBI are usually referred to as bank notes  They are 
in the nature of promissory notes 
Monetary Policy 
The basic goals of macroeconomic policy in most of the countries are 
full employment  price stability  rapid economic growth  balance of payments 
equilibrium and economic justice  Economic justice refers to equitable distribution of 
income  The government tries to achieve the goals through macroeconomic policy 
Macroeconomic policy can be broadly divided into monetary policy and fiscal policy 
Of course  the government follows other policies such as industrial policy  agricultural 
policy  tariff policy and so on  But we limit our discussion only to monetary policy 
and the fiscal policy  In the present chapter  we shall study the monetary policy with 
reference to our country 
 Monetary policy is policy that employs the central bank s control over the 
supply and cost of money as an instrument for achieving the objectives of economic 
policy   Edward Shapiro 
Instruments of Monetary Policy 
Roughly we may say that monetary policy is credit control policy  The 
instruments of credit control can be broadly divided into  
  Quantitative credit control measures   and 
  Selective credit control measures 
Quantitative credit control instruments include bank rate policy  variation of cash 
reserve ratios and open market operations 
  Bank Rate   The Bank rate is the minimum rate at which the central bank of a 
country will lend money to all other banks  Suppose  there is too much of money in 
circulation  Then the central bank should take some money out of circulation  It can 
do it by increasing the bank rate  When the bank rate goes up  the rates charged 
by other banks go up  The belief is that if the rate of interest goes up  businessmen 
will be discouraged to borrow more money and producers will borrow less money for 
investment  Generally  to control inflation  the central bank will increase the bank rate 
 
  Variation of cash Reserve Ratios   The ability of a commercial bank to create 
credit depends upon its cash reserves  The central bank of a country has the power 
to vary the cash reserve ratios  During inflation  to check the sharp rise in commodity 
prices and to control credit  the central bank can make use of this weapon 
  Open Market Operations   In India  the open market operations have been 
conducted in Central Government securities and State Government securities  The 
success of open market operations as a weapon of credit control  depends mainly 
on  i  the possession by the central bank of adequate volume of securities     the 
presence of well developed bill  securities  market   and   stability of cash reserve 
ratios maintained by commercial banks  These things are missing to a great degree 
in India  So  open market operations have not become a powerful weapon of credit 
control in our country  They have been largely used in India more to assist the 
Government in its borrowing operations rather than controlling credit 
Selective credit controls 
Selective credit controls can play an important role in an under- developed 
money market with a planned economy  Unlike the instruments of quantitative credit 
control  the selective instruments affect the types of credit extended by commercial 
banks  They not only prevent flow of credit into undesirable channels  but also 
direct the flow of credit into useful channels  The Reserve Bank of India had started 
applying the selective credit controls since  
The weapons of selective credit controls include  a  Fixing minimum margin 
of lending or for purchase of securities   For example  shares or commodities like 
foodgrains and raw materials which are in short supply  In this case  the central bank 
specifies the fraction of the purchase price of securities that must be paid in cash 
Unlike general controls  selective controls make it possible for the central bank to 
restrain what is regarded as an unhealthy expansion of credit   eg  for financing the 
purchase of securities or automobiles   
b  Ceiling on the amount of credit for expansion and 
c  Different rates of interest will be charged to encourage certain sectors and to 
discourage certain other sectors  In our country  the last weapon has been 
used especially  to encourage exports  agricultural production and production 
in small scale and cottage industries sector 
d  The central bank will persuade the commercial banks to follow certain 
policies through moral suasion 
Conclusion   Monetary policy is usually effective for controlling inflation  But during 
the Great Depression of  s  it was found to be ineffective  So Keynes suggested 
a bold and dynamic fiscal policy to tackle the problems of mass unemployment 
and bad trade characterized by falling prices and deficiency in aggregate demand   
 
But since  s  the world has been facing the problem of stagflation marked by 
stagnation and lack of demand on the one hand and inflation on the other  In the 
case of stagflation  both monetary policy and fiscal policy are found to be ineffective 
So incomes policy such as voluntary restraint on wages by employees  and on prices 
by producers have been suggested as a complement to the monetary policy and the 
fiscal policy 
In India  the usual methods of credit control are not operative in an effective 
manner  The main reasons for the ineffectiveness of the monetary policy of the RBI 
is this  Two main conditions essential for the success of the credit policy are the 
dependence of the money market upon commercial banks and dependence of the 
commercial banks on the central bank for their funds  Both these conditions have 
been only partially fulfilled in India  That is why  the credit control measures of RBI 
have not been totally effective in India  Not only that  in recent times unaccounted 
money  black money  has been used for financing speculative dealings 
Monetary Transmission 
The transmission mechanism tells that monetary policy affects income through 
the interest rate and investment  It is the process by which money supply affects 
income  Let us suppose that the government follows cheap money  The central bank 
for example  may reduce the bank rate  This will result in a fall in the market rate 
of interest  Then the investment will go up  This  in turn  will increase employment 
and income  The increase in money supply can also be caused by variation of cash 
reserve ratios and open market operations

Fig    illustrates how transmission mechanism works  Part A of the diagram 
tells that when there is a fall in the rate of interest from r  to ro money supply  
 
increases from Mo to M  As a result of the fall in the rate of interest and increase in 
the supply of money  investment increases from I 
 to I 
 as shown in Fig     b  The 
increase in investment results in increase in income from Yo 
 to Y 
  as shown in fig 
 c 
Many modern economists argue that this view of transmission mechanism is 
rather narrow  They say that like investment  consumption may vary with the interest 
rate  The classical economists assumed that consumption is inversely related to the 
rate of interest  If we accept that view  a fall in the interest rate will cause an increase 
in consumption  Since consumption is a component of aggregate demand  aggregate 
demand increases  This in turn  will increase the equilibrium level of income  If both 
consumption and investment increase  income will increase by a greater amount than 
if only investment increases 
The monetary economists further argue that monetary policy may also affect 
income by altering net private wealth 
Net Private wealth may be defined as society s capital stock  money supply 
and government debt  government debt includes treasury bills  notes and bonds 
And consumption is positively related to net private wealth  If the nominal money 
supply increases and price level is constant  the real money supply increases  Since 
it is a component of net private wealth  wealth increases  and in turn consumption 
increases  When consumption increases  aggregate demand increases and the 
equilibrium level of income increases  It may be noted that wealth and consumption 
increase without regard to changes in the rate of interest  It follows that monetary 
policy is effective even in the liquidity trap  According to Keynes  liquidity trap refers 
to a situation in which an increase in the money supply does not result in a fall in the 
interest rate but merely in an addition to idle balances 
Dear Money 
When there is inflation in a country  the central bank tries to control it by 
following dear money policy  The term  Dear Money  refers to a phase or policy when 
interest rates are high 
Cheap Money 
 Cheap Money  denotes a phase in which loans are available at low rates of 
interest or a policy which creates this situation  Cheap money policy is followed by a 
central bank during a period of depression to increase the supply of money so as to 
stimulate investment 
Value of money 
By  Value of Money  we mean the purchasing power of money  The 
purchasing power of money depends upon the price level  A general rise in the price 
level indicates a fall in the value of money and a general fall in prices indicates a rise 
in the value of money 
 
The Quantity Theory of Money and the Equation of Exchange 
The Quantity Theory of Money was formulated by Irving Fisher  In its original 
form  the quantity theory states   prices always change in exact proportion to 
changes in the quantity of money  If the amount of money is doubled  prices double 
If the amount of money is halved  prices fall to half their original level  The main 
point about the quantity theory is that price level changes because of changes in the 
quantity of money 
Equation of Exchange   The quantity theory of money has been put forward in 
the form of an equation known as the  Equation of Exchange  It is also known 
as Fisher s equation  The equation of exchange states that if  M  is the amount of 
money   V  is the velocity of circulation of money   P  is the price level and  T  is the 
volume of trade  then MV   PT  or P   MV T 
This is known as the equation of exchange  Velocity of circulation  V  refers 
to the number of times that each unit of money is used during a given period  The 
equation tells when the supply of money increases  other things being equal  there 
will be a rise in the price level  That means a fall in the value of money  For example 
when  M  is doubled P  will be doubled 
Now a days  a large proportion of money consists of cheques  bills and other 
forms of credit instruments  So some economists are of the opinion that the above 
types of money should be taken into account while considering the quantity of money 
So the Equation of Exchange has been modified as follows  - 
PT   MV   M 
V 
 where M 
 is the total amount of all forms of cheques  bills 
and other instruments of credit in circulation and V 
 is the velocity of circulation of M 
 credit instruments  The main criticism against the quantity theory of money is that 
it is based on the assumption of full employment  But if full employment is not there 
and if there are unemployed resources  an increase in the quantity of money will not 
generally increase prices  Again  during depression  all prices fall  Even if the quantity 
of money is increased at that time  prices will not rise  In spite of the above criticism 
we may note that the quantity theory of money is a statement of tendency and it 
indicates in a crude way the relationship between prices and the quantity of money 
Changes in price level may be influenced by many things other than the 
quantity of money such as Government s monetary policy and fiscal policy  the supply 
of goods in the given period  the volume of trade  changes in the incomes of the 
people and effective demand for goods  One way of studying about changes in prices 
is to study about inflation and deflation 
Inflation and Deflation 
The terms  inflation  and  deflation  are not easy to define  Different economists 
have defined them in different ways  Crowther has given us the most simple and  
 
useful definition of these terms  According to Crowther   Inflation is a state in which 
the value of money is falling  i e  prices are rising  So it is generally regarded that 
during a period of inflation  the price level will rise  It is also described as a situation 
where too much money chases too few goods resulting in an abnormal increase 
of price level  Shapiro has defined inflation as  a persistent and appreciable rise in 
the general level of prices  And Harry Johnson has defined it as a  sustained rise 
in prices  However  we should remember one important point  That is  there can be 
inflation even without a rise in the price level  This is known as  Repressed Inflation 
Usually this happens during a war period  On account of many controls and rationing 
that exist during wartime  prices will be kept under check  But the moment controls 
are withdrawn  prices will go up  So the real test of inflation is neither an increase 
in the amount of money nor a rise in prices  but the appearance of abnormal profits 
Whenever businessmen and producers make huge profits  it is a sign of inflation 
Types of Inflation 
  Demand   Pull Inflation   It is loosely described as  too much money chasing too 
few goods  This refers to the situation where general price level rises because 
the demand for goods and services exceeds the supply available at the existing 
prices 
Creeping or Persistent inflation   Since the end of world War II  i e  since  
there has been a tendency for prices and wages to push one another upwards  This 
situation has been described as creeping or persistent inflation 
Runaway or Galloping or Hyper   Inflation 
This is a serious type of inflation  For example  it was experienced in Germany 
after World War I and in Hungary and China after World War II  In this situation 
prices rise to a very great extent at high speed and high prices have to be paid even 
for cheap things  And money becomes quite worthless and new currency has to be 
introduced  This situation is known as galloping inflation or hyper-inflation 
  Cost   Push Inflation 
Cost   push inflation is induced by rising costs  including wages  so that rising 
wages and other costs push up prices  We can also speak of wage inflation or price 
inflation when we mean increase in wages or prices 
Bottleneck Inflation   This refers to inflation that results from shortages  imbalances 
and rising marginal costs as full employment output is approached 
Profit   Push Inflation - Just as trade unions manage to push up wages 
oligopolists and monopolists will raise prices more than enough to cover increase in 
costs with the aim of making monopoly profits 
 
Generally during war and in the post- war period  there will be inflation  This 
is so because during war  the incomes of people increase  But there will be shortage 
of goods and there may be rationing  control and things like that  So during the post - 
war years  people who have been forced to save money will spend  That is  demand 
for all sorts of goods will increase during that period but supply will not increase so 
fast as that  This leads to inflation  Inflation occurs during war because the one great 
aim at that time is that of winning the war  Since modern wars are so expensive 
the Government has to depend upon created money to finance war  This leads to 
inflation  And inflation breeds inflation  It means that inflation leads to inflation  During 
a period of inflation  prices will be high  Since prices are high  workers will demand 
high wages  High wages result in high costs  High costs in turn lead to high prices 
Thus it forms a vicious circle   Wages force up prices   prices force up wages  This 
is the inflationary spiral   Deficit financing  is another cause of inflation  This applies 
particularly to underdeveloped countries with planned economies  Inflationary trends 
can be noticed also during the boom period of a trade cycle 
Since inflation has many evils  every government tries to check it  Inflation 
has destroyed many economies  For example the inflation that took place in   in 
Germany destroyed her economic system  Inflation can be checked by some or all of 
the following measures 
  Increased taxation   By reducing government expenditure on capital projects 
 In India  this measure has been suggested to check inflation  Many capital 
projects proposed in our Third Five Year Plan were either suspended or dropped 
completely    Restrictions on imports   Rationing and   Price controls 
Sometimes a  wage freeze  is recommended to check inflation  That is  trade 
unions will be requested not to ask for an increase in wages during a given 
period  The success of the above measures in tackling inflation depends upon 
the efficiency of the government in implementing the measures 
Deflation   Crowther  defines deflation as a  state in which the value of money is 
rising  i e  prices are falling  Both inflation and deflation refer to the movement 
of prices  Deflation is the opposite of inflation  Generally inflation is a period 
characterized by rising activity and employment  But during deflation  there will be 
bad trade and unemployment  During deflation  since prices fall faster than costs 
there will be heavy losses for producers and businessmen  There will not be profits 
in any branch of economic activity  So there will be a fall in investment  This results 
in unemployment  Both inflation and deflation are evils  There is nothing much 
to choose between them  While rising prices can be checked to some extent by 
the monetary policy of the government  the latter is of little help in raising the price 
level during deflation  It does not work  That is why during such periods  modern 
economists suggest that the State must play an active role in the economic field 
and step up economic activity by undertaking a series of public works programmes   
 
 Wage- cut  is sometimes recommended as a remedy for depression  But it is not a 
correct solution  It will only make matters worse 
Effects of changes in prices 
Changes in prices affect different sections of the community in different ways 
They affect production and distribution too 
  Effects on production 
If prices are rising  it will stimulate production  Under a capitalistic system 
production is carried on mainly for profits  During a period of rising prices  inflation 
there will be abnormal profits  This increases production  So manufacturers and 
businessmen gain during inflation  Producers and businessmen gain during inflation 
Producers gain by inflation because during that period prices rise faster than costs 
So they make huge profits  But if inflation becomes hyper-inflation  it may end in a 
crash  On account of the rapid fall in the value of money  profits which are in the form 
of money may become worthless  And there will be a  flight from currency  Inflation 
may become an important cause of  violent revolutions and economic chaos 
In a period of falling prices  businessmen incur huge losses because prices 
fall faster than costs  And there will be little scope for investment  This results in 
unemployment on large scale  There will be business depression  During depression 
money may be cheaply available  prices of materials will be low  men will be available 
for work but there will be no investment  no employment  no incomes and no demand 
for goods  Such a situation has been described as  poverty in the midst of plenty  The 
Great Depression of  s is a case in point 
  Effects on Distribution 
a  Business class   During inflation  manufacturers and businessmen make huge 
profits  Of course  during deflation  they make losses 
b  Fixed income groups   People in fixed income groups are hit hard in times of 
inflation  The incomes of wage earners and salaried people such as teachers 
clerks and judges do not increase as fast as prices  Even retired people getting 
pension are also affected during inflation 
Wage earners and salaried   people gain during a period of falling prices 
But it is not a real gain because many people will lose their jobs during deflation 
Unemployment is a worse evil than rising prices 
c  Investors   people who have invested their money in  gilt edged  securities 
 government securities  will get only fixed income  So their position is like those 
in the fixed income group  But those who have shares in companies will make 
profits during a period of rising prices and lose during a period of falling prices 
In Germany  thousands of middle class families were ruined during the inflation  
 
because all their lifetime savings were reduced to nothing by the tremendous 
rise in prices  If the value of money falls continuously  it becomes unsuitable as a 
store of value  People will not save at all 
d  Rentiers   Rentiers gain during deflation and lose during inflation  But the gain 
during deflation is only a temporary feature 
It can be seen from the above discussion that violent changes in prices are a 
bad thing  Both inflation and deflation are great evils   Inflation is unjust and deflation 
is inexpedient   disadvantageous  Some economists believe that of the two 
deflation is worse because it results in unemployment  That is why it is now generally 
agreed that a steadily rising price level is a good thing for economic progress and 
social justice  We may agree with Robertson when he says that  money which is a 
source of so many blessings to mankind  becomes also  unless we can control it  a 
source of peril and confusion

Chapter  
Fiscal Policy 
Public finance or government finance is a field of economics  It deals with 
budgeting the revenues and expenditures of government  or public sector  It is about 
the identification of and appraisal of the means and effects of government financial 
policies  Public finance deals with the financing of the State activities and it discusses 
the financial operations of the public treasury  Fiscal economics is another name for 
public finance 
The functions of the government were minimal in the early days of the 
development of economic philosophy  The economic decisions were guided by 
the market forces of demand and supply and the government was not expected to 
interfere with the working of the market forces  Earlier governments limited their 
activities to a  the maintenance of law and order b  the defence of the country c 
administration of justice d  general administration  The early State was a police State 
Modern governments do not confine their activities to the barest minimum 
Besides the activities performed by the early State  modern governments undertake 
a number of growth and development-oriented projects and welfare activities for the 
well-being of the people  The modern State is a Welfare State  Therefore there is a 
change in the concept of a modern State which is a welfare State  The State has to 
mobilize adequate resources for meeting out the ever increasing expenditures  as the 
responsibilities and functions of the State have multiplied 
Fiscal economics in the modern days has undergone far-reaching changes 
These changes can also be studied through macro aspects of fiscal policy  It relates 
to macro economic functions of the government  It is concerned with the taxation 
public expenditure and monetary policy which affects the overall level of employment 
and price level  It may be noted that there is a link between economic theory and the 
theory of public finance 
Definition 
Economists have defined public finance differently  The following are some of 
the popular definitions 
According to Dalton   Public finance is concerned with the income and 
expenditure of public authorities and with the adjustment of the one with the other 
Findlay Shirras says that   Public finance is the study of the Principles 
underlying the spending and raising of funds by public authorities 
To quote Lutz   Public finance deals with the provision  custody  and 
disbursement of resources needed for the conduct of public or government 
functions 
 
We may conclude from the above definitions that Public Finance or Fiscal 
Economics is concerned with the principles and practices of obtaining funds and 
spending the same for achieving the maximum social welfare and economic growth 
in the country 
Subject matter of public finance 
The following subdivisions form the subject matter of public finance 
  Public expenditure 
  Public Revenue 
  Public debt 
  Financial administration and 
  Federal finance 
  Public expenditure 
Since the modern government represents a welfare state  the responsibility of 
the government is to bring about maximum social welfare  In addition to this  it has to 
perform various other functions  which require heavy expenditures  We study in this 
sub-division  the fundamental principles governing the flow of government funds into 
different spending streams and the methods of incurring expenditure on the various 
activities 
  Public Revenue 
Public revenue means different sources of government s income  It deals with 
the methods of raising revenue for the government  principles of taxation and other 
related problems  Raising of tax revenue and non- tax revenue is the subject matter 
of public revenue  Tax revenue deals with the kinds of taxes and the impact and 
incidence of various taxes  Non-tax revenue includes 
i  Commercial revenue  income earned through sale of goods and services and 
profits earned by public sector enterprises 
ii  Administrative revenues  Fees  license fees  special assessments 
iii  Gifts and grants 
  Public debt 
The problem relating to the raising and repayment of public loans is studied 
under this sub-division  Borrowing by the government from the public is called 
public debt  In modern world  it is not possible for the government to meet all its 
expenditure through tax and non-tax revenue  Hence public revenue falls short of 
public expenditure  As a result  governments are forced to borrow from internal and  
 
external sources  In the case of internal debt  Government borrows from the people 
commercial banks and the central bank  External debt includes borrowing from 
international monetary institutions like IMF and World Bank and also from foreign 
countries  The soundness of the borrowing policy of the governments and indication 
of the healthy direction of spending are examined under this sub-division 
  Financial administration 
Financial administration is concerned with the organisation and functioning 
of the government machinery that is responsible for performing various financial 
activities of the state  Preparing the budget for the particular financial year is the 
master financial plan of the government  The various works  starting with the 
objectives of designing a budget  the methods of preparing it  presentation of the 
budget before the Parliament and State Assembly  passing or sanctioning by the 
Parliament  execution  auditing  implementation etc  constitute the subject matter of 
financial administration 
  Federal finance 
Federal finance is a part of the study of public finance  A federation is an 
association of two or more states  In a federal form of government  there are 
Central  State  and local governments  The interrelationships between these forms 
of governments  and the problems related to them and the financial functions of all 
these units are studied under federal finance 
Meaning and definition of a tax 
A tax is one of the important sources of public revenue  A tax is a compulsory 
charge or payment levied by the government on an individual or corporation 
Therefore an element of compulsion is involved in taxation  Other sources of public 
revenue are excluded from this compulsory element  There is no direct give and take 
relationship between a taxpayer and the government 
Definition of a tax 
According to Prof  Seligman   A tax is a compulsory contribution from the 
person to the State to defray the expenditure incurred in the common interest of all 
without any reference to the special benefits conferred 
In the words of Dalton   A tax is a compulsory contribution imposed by the 
public authority  irrespective of the exact amount of service rendered to the taxpayer 
in return for which no specific and direct quid pro quo is rendered to the payer 
From these definitions  it is clear that tax is a compulsory contribution  It 
means that the State has the right to tax  Refusal to pay the tax is punishable  The 
phrase  without quid pro quo  means the absence of direct and proportional benefit to 
the taxpayer from the government 
 
Canons of Taxation 
Canons of taxation are considered as fundamental principles of taxation 
Adam Smith laid down the following canons of taxation 
a  Canon of equity 
b  Canon of certainty 
c  Canon of convenience 
d  Canon of economy 
  Canon of equity 
This canon is also called the  ability to pay  principle of taxation  It means that 
taxes should be imposed according to the capacity of the tax payer  Poor should be 
taxed less and rich should be taxed more  This canon involves the principle of justice 
All persons contribute according to their ability  As the cost of running the government 
should be equally borne by all  this canon is justified 
  Canon of certainty 
Every tax payer should know the amount of tax to be paid  when to be paid 
and where to be paid and also should be certain about the rate of tax to make 
investment decisions 
  Canon of convenience 
Tax payment should be convenient and less burdensome to the tax payer  e g 
income tax collected at source  sales tax collected at the time of sales and land tax 
collected after harvest 
  Canon of economy 
This canon signifies that the cost of collecting the revenue should be kept at 
the minimum possible level  The tax laws and procedures should be made simple 
so as to reduce the expenses in maintaining people s income tax accounts  ie 
administrative expenditure to be kept at a minimum 
Kinds of tax  Taxes are of different types  They are 
  Direct and Indirect taxes 
  Proportional  progressive  Regressive and digressive taxes 
  Specific and advalorem taxes 
  Value-added tax  VAT 
  Single and multiple taxes 
 
  Direct and Indirect taxes 
According to Dalton   A direct tax is one which is really paid by a person on 
whom it is imposed whereas an indirect tax  though imposed on a person  is partly or 
wholly paid by another 
In the case of a direct tax  the tax payer who pays a direct tax is also the tax 
bearer  In the case of indirect taxes  the taxpayer and the tax bearer are different 
persons 
Direct taxes 
Direct taxes are collected from the public directly  That it is to say  these taxes 
are imposed on and collected from the same person  One cannot evade paying the 
tax if it is imposed on him 
Income tax  wealth tax  corporate tax  gift tax  estate duty  expenditure tax are 
good examples of direct taxes 
Indirect taxes 
Taxes imposed on commodities and services are termed as indirect taxes 
There is a chance for shifting the burden of indirect taxes  The incidence is upon the 
person who ultimately pays it  Examples of indirect taxes are excise duties  customs 
duties and sales taxes  commodity taxes 
The classification of direct taxes and indirect taxes is based on the criterion 
of shifting of the incidence of tax  The burden of a direct tax is borne by the person 
on whom it is levied  For example  income tax is a direct tax  Its burden falls on the 
person who is liable to pay it to the Government  He cannot transfer the burden to 
some other person 
An indirect tax is initially paid by one person but ultimately the burden of 
the tax is fully or partially borne by another person  Because there is a possibility 
of transfer of burden of an indirect tax  For example  the excise duty on a motorbike 
is initially paid by the manufacturer  But he subsequently shifts this burden to the 
consumer by including the tax in the price of the bike  Roughly  we may say that the 
direct taxes are paid by the rich and the indirect taxes are paid by the poor 
Taxes of Central Government and State Governments 
The financial system of India is federal in character  Therefore  the powers and 
functions to raise revenue are divided between central government and state and 
local governments as scheduled in the Indian Constitution  This division has been 
made to avoid any clash in financial  administrative and other areas 
 
Taxes of the central government 
The main sources of tax and non-tax revenue of the central government are  
Taxes on income  other than on agricultural income    Corporate tax    Expenditure 
tax    Taxes on properties  Estate duties and Death duties    Gift tax    Wealth tax 
  Taxation on capital gains    Union excise duties  and  Customs duties  Import 
and Export duties 
The sources of non-tax revenue of the central government include  Fiscal 
services    Receipts from interest on loans    Dividend and profits    General and 
administrative services    Social and community services and   Economic services 
Taxes of the State Governments 
Under the Constitution of India  only the State governments are provided 
with separate powers to raise revenue  while the Union territories are financed by 
the Central government directly  The main sources of tax and non-tax revenue are 
  Land revenue    Taxes on the sale and purchase of goods except newspaper 
  Taxes on agricultural income    Taxes on land and building    Succession and 
estate duties in respect of agricultural land    Excise duty on alcoholic liquors and 
narcotics    Taxes on the entry of goods into a local area    Taxes on mineral 
rights    Taxes on the consumption of electricity   Taxes on vehicles  animals and 
boats    Taxes on goods and passengers carried by road and inland water ways 
  Stamp duties  court fees and registration    Entertainment tax    Taxes on 
advertisements other than those in newspaper    Taxes on trade  profession and 
employment    Income from irrigation and forests    Grants from the central 
government and   Other incomes such as income from registration and share in 
the income-tax  excise and estate duties and debt services  loans and overdrafts 
Progressive  Proportional  Regressive and Digressive taxes 
Direct taxes can also be classified on the basis of the degree of 
progressiveness or distribution of their burden on the tax payers  Ability of the people 
to pay a tax is measured on the basis of property  income  size of the family and 
consumption etc  The ability to pay in practice implies tax base and tax rate  Tax base 
denotes the income  property and expenditure on the basis of which ability to pay the 
tax is measured  Rate structure indicates equalisation of burden of taxation  Tax rate 
is the percentage of tax levied per unit of tax base  The total amount of tax is equal to 
the tax base multiplied by tax rate 
On the basis of rate structure  taxes are classified as follows 
a  Proportional tax 
In the case of a proportional tax  tax rate remains constant regardless of 
whether the tax base is large or small  It means uniform tax rate is imposed on the 
rich as well as the poor  The tax paid by the people is fixed in proportion to their 
income and wealth and other tax bases 
 
b  Progressive tax 
In the case a progressive tax  the tax rate increases as the tax base increases 
With the increase in income  a taxpayer has to pay a higher tax  For example  in the 
case of income tax  exemption limit and tax slabs are characterised by the income 
tax structure formulated by the government of India  As each income slab increases 
there is an increase in the rates of tax 
c  Regressive tax 
When the tax liability on income falls with the increase in the tax payer s 
income  it is termed as a regressive tax  Here  the tax rate decreases as the tax base 
increases  Under this tax system  the poorer sections of the society are taxed at 
higher rates than the richer sections and hence this tax is not just or equitable 
d  Degressive tax 
Degressive tax is a blend of progressive tax and proportional tax  The rate of 
taxation increases upto a point  After that limit  a uniform rate is charged  Here the 
rate of tax does not increase in the same proportion as the increase in income  Under 
this tax system  the higher income groups make less sacrifice than the lower income 
groups 
Budget 
Meaning  Government s revenue and expenditure decisions are presented 
in the budget  Budget  being an essential and important element of planning and 
development  provide the specific development objectives to be pursued and the 
required policy direction  They are necessary because income and expenditure do 
not occur simultaneously 
Thus   budget  has been defined as the annual financial statement of the 
estimated receipts and proposed expenditure of the government in a financial year 
usually April   to March   of the next year 
The term budget is derived from the French word  Bougette  It means  small 
bag  As such  the Finance minister of a country carries a bag containing abstracts of 
budget papers while presenting the budget in the Parliament or a State Legislature 
The governments  both Union and State  prepare their budget every financial 
year  Government budget indicates the probable income and expenditure of the 
government  the financial policies  taxation measures  investment opportunities 
extent of saving  utilization of resources  mobilization of capital etc 
Definition  Various definitions have been formulated for the concept of Budget 
Prof  Dimock says   A budget is a balanced estimate of expenditures and 
receipts for a given period of time  In the hands of the administration  the budget is 
record of past performance  a method of current control and a projection of future 
plans 
 
To quote Gladstone   Budgets are not merely matters of arithmetic but in a 
thousand ways go to the root of prosperity of individuals and relation of classes and 
the strength of Kingdom 
Therefore  the budget is a document containing preliminary approval plan of 
public revenue and expenditures  It bridges the proposed revenue and proposed 
expenditure for the budget period 
Kinds of Budget 
Balanced budget and unbalanced budget 
  Balanced Budget   A balanced budget is that  over a period of time 
revenue does not fall short of expenditure  In other words government 
budget is said to be balanced when its tax revenue and expenditure are 
equal 
  Unbalanced Budget  Surplus or deficit    An unbalanced budget is 
that  over a period of time  revenue exceeds expenditure or expenditure 
exceeds revenue  In other words  the government s income or tax revenue 
and expenditure are not equal  When there is an excess of income over 
expenditure  it is called a surplus budget  On the other hand  when there is 
an excess of expenditure over income  it is a case of deficit budget 
Classical economists advocated balanced budget  But it is not always helpful 
in achieving and sustaining economic growth 
Modern economists argue that an unbalanced budget is very useful for 
achieving and maintaining economic stability 
Revenue Budget and Capital Budget   Budgeting is the most important constituent 
of the financial administration  Preparation of the budget is one of the main 
operations of budgeting  It is mandatory for the government to make a statement 
of estimated receipts and expenditures which must be laid before the Parliament 
every financial year  It has to distinguish expenditure on revenue account and capital 
account from other expenditures  So government budget comprises Revenue Budget 
and Capital Budget 
Revenue Budget   Revenue budget consists of revenue receipts of the government 
 tax revenue and non-tax revenue  and the expenditure met from these revenues 
Expenditures which do not result in creation of assets are called revenue 
expenditure   e g  current revenues and current expenditure for normal functioning of 
the Government departments  interest charges on debt incurred by Govt  and other 
non- developmental expenditure 
Capital budget   Majority of the government expenditures form the capital 
expenditure  Capital budget consists of receipts and payments  Capital receipts 
are loans raised by government from the public which are called market loans   
 
borrowings from the RBI  sale of treasury bills  loans received from foreign 
governments etc  Capital payments are expenditure on assets creation such as land 
buildings  machinery  equipment investment loans to government companies and 
state governments and other developmental expenditures 
Performance budgeting 
The process of fund allocation of governments in various countries has 
been changed from traditional expenditure budgeting to new forms of rationalistic 
budgeting  such as performance budgeting  programme budgeting and zero based 
budgeting 
Under performance budgeting  various activities of the government are 
identified in the budget both in financial and physical terms  This is necessary to 
ascertain the relationship between input and output and to assess the performance in 
relation to cost 
Performance budgeting is conceived as a system of presenting public 
expenditure in terms of distinguishable divisions such as government functions 
programmes  activities and projects  such presentation would reflect the cost of 
running the government 
Under this technique  funds are granted for carrying out specific amount of 
work identified under a particular division  A cost-benefit approach is employed which 
facilitates meaningful and purposeful allocation of funds 
This method of budget technique promotes cost consciousness as well as cost 
efficiency and suggests corrections wherever required in the process of allocation of 
funds 
Zero based budgeting 
Traditional technique of budgeting have been found to be inadequate for the 
reason that  the previous year s cost level is taken as the base for current year s 
budget  The traditional methods have not completely addressed the problem of 
efficiency in the matter of allocation of funds for various divisions  There is therefore a 
need for a new technique of budgeting which devices and uses a meaningful base for 
budgeting  Zero Based Budgeting is one such technique of budgeting 
In zero based budgeting  every year is considered as a new year thus 
providing a connecting link between the previous year and the current year  The past 
performance and programmes are not taken into account  The budget is viewed as 
entirely a fresh and whole fiscal initiative i e  from zero bases 
Zero based budgeting evaluates and prioritizes the programmes of action 
at different levels  Each department has to justify its budget from its perspectives 
evaluating feasible alternatives  before final selection and execution  the funds will be 
allocated for the selected programmes 
 
Fiscal policy 
Meaning 
Fiscal policy is the set of principles and decisions of a government regarding 
the level of public expenditure and mode of financing them  It is about the effort of 
government to influence the economy s output  employment and prices by altering 
the level of public expenditure  taxation and public debt  Arthur Smithies points 
out   Fiscal policy is a policy under which the government uses its expenditure and 
revenue programmes to produce desirable effects and avoid undesirable effects on 
the national income  production and employment 
The Importance of Fiscal Policy 
The significance of this policy was not at all recognized by economists before 
the publication of Keynes s General Theory of Employment  Interest and Money 
Keynes gave the concept of fiscal policy new meaning and operation of the public 
finance a new perspective  He made it clear that taxation  public spending and public 
debt are the effective instruments of public policy capable of determining the level of 
output and employment 
The importance of fiscal policy in modern economies arises from the fact that 
the State under democracy is called upon to play an active and important role in 
promoting economic development and providing a vast number of essential public 
utilities and services like drinking water  sanitation  civic services  primary education 
public health  social welfare  defence  etc  Most of these goods are characterized 
by the property viz  non-marketable  that it cannot be sold in the market to the 
consumer  But payment has to be regulated in another way  through taxation 
In the underdeveloped economies  public finance has to assume yet another 
role  whereas in developed economies  it aims at maintaining economic stability  In 
underdeveloped economies  desirous of achieving rapid economic development  the 
function of public finance is to promote rapid economic development of the country 
besides maintaining economic stability 
Objectives of fiscal policy 
The principal objectives of fiscal policy in an economy are as follows 
  To mobilize resources for financing the development programmes in the 
public sector 
Tax policy is to be directed towards effective mobilization of all available 
resources and to harness them in the execution of development programmes  This 
implies  on the one hand  diversion of wasteful and luxury spending to saving and on 
the other hand productive investment of increments that accrue to production as a 
result of development efforts  Taxation can be a most effective means of increasing  
 
the total quantum of savings and investments in any economy where the propensity 
to consume is normally high 
  To promote development in the private sector 
In a mixed economy  private sector forms an important constituent of the 
economy  In spite of the growing importance of the public sector in accelerating 
the process of economic development  the interest of the private sector cannot be 
neglected  Therefore rebates  reliefs and liberal depreciation allowances may be 
granted to boost the private sector 
  To bring about an optimum utilization of resources 
The above objective can be achieved through proper allocation of resources 
We must direct investment in the desirable channels both in the public and private 
sectors by providing suitable incentives  Productive resources are  within limits 
capable of being used in various ways  which may accelerate economic growth 
The available resources must find their way into the socially necessary lines of 
development 
  To restrain inflationary pressures in the economy to ensure economic 
stability 
The fiscal policy must be used as an instrument for dealing with inflationary 
or deflationary situations  One way to achieve this is to devise a tax structure  which 
will automatically counter the economic disturbances as they arise  The second is 
to make changes in the tax system in order to deal with inflationary or deflationary 
situations  In countries like India  it is through the direction of the public expenditure 
rather than taxation that more effective action can be taken to remove the effect of a 
deflationary spiral  In terms of inflation  anti-inflationary taxes such as excess profit 
tax and commodity taxes on articles of both general and luxury consumption can be 
imposed 
  To improve distribution of income and wealth in the community for lessening 
economic inequalities 
The national income should be properly distributed so that the fruits of 
development are fairly shared by all people  Equality in income  wealth and 
opportunities must form an integral part of economic development and social 
advance  Moreover  redistribution of income in favour of the poorer sections of the 
society is essential  This can be achieved through taxation  We can also achieve this 
through an increase in public expenditure for promoting welfare to the less privileged 
class  Expenditure on agriculture  irrigation  education and health and medical 
expenses will improve the economic conditions of the weaker sections of the society 
Fiscal policy can affect total spending   aggregate demand determinant 
in two ways  The first is the direct change in total spending brought about by the  
 
government increasing or decreasing its own expenditure  And the second one is 
increasing or reducing private spending by varying its own tax revenue 
  To obtain full employment and economic growth 
The fiscal policy to achieve full employment and to maintain stable price in the 
economy has been developed in the recent past  The ineffectiveness of monetary 
policy as a means to remove unemployment during the Great Depression paved the 
way for the development of fiscal policy in achieving this objective  For accelerating 
the rate of growth  allocation of higher proportion of the fully employed resources 
is needed  Those activities increase the productive capacity of the economy 
Therefore fiscal policy is used through its tax instrument to encourage investment 
and discourage consumption so that production may increase  It is also necessary 
to increase capital formation by reducing the high income tax on personal income 
To increase employment  the state expenditure should be directed towards providing 
social and economic overheads  The state should undertake local public works of 
community development involving more labour and less capital per head 
  Fiscal policy and capital formation 
Fiscal policy such as taxes  tariffs  transfer payments  rebate and subsidies 
are expected to spur long run economic growth through increased capital formation 
Capital formation is considered an important determinant of economic growth  The 
economic theory tells us that the optimal amount of capital formation serves a useful 
key to economic growth in developing economies  At the same time  the economic 
distortions brought about by lack of adequate fiscal incentives can cause capital 
formation to fall short of the socially optimal level 
Limitations to fiscal policy 
Though the fiscal policy has an important place in economic development and 
in particular  in the stepping up of saving and investment both in public and in private 
sectors  it has the following limitations 
  Size of fiscal measures 
The budget is not a mere statement of receipts and revenues of the 
government  It explains and shapes the economic structure of a country  When the 
budget forms a small part of the national income in developing economies  fiscal 
policy cannot have the desired impact on the economic development  Direct taxation 
at times become an instrument of limited applicability  as the vast majority of the 
people are not covered by it  Further  when the total tax revenue forms a smaller 
portion of the national income  fiscal measures will not step up the sagging economy 
requiring massive help 
 
  Fiscal policy as ineffective anti-cyclical measure 
Fiscal measures- both loosening fiscal policy and tightening fiscal policy- will 
not stimulate speedy economic growth of a country  when the different sectors of the 
economy are not closely integrated with one another  Action taken by the government 
may not always have the same effect on all the sectors  Thus we may have for 
instance the recession in some sectors followed by a rise in prices in other sectors 
An increasing purchasing power through deficit financing  a policy advocated by J M 
Keynes in  s may not have the effect of reviving the recession hit economies  but 
merely result in a spiralling rise in prices 
  Administrative delay 
Fiscal measures may introduce delay  uncertainties and arbitrariness arising 
from administrative bottlenecks  As a result  fiscal policy fails to be a powerful and 
therefore a useful stabilization policy 
Other Limitations 
Large scale underemployment  lack of coordination from the public  tax 
evasion  low tax base are the other limitations of fiscal policy

 Notes 
What is a Bank 
Oxford Dictionary defines a bank as  an establishment for custody 
of money  which it pays out on customer s order 
According to Prof  Sayers   A bank is an institution whose debts 
are widely accepted in settlement of other people s debts to each other  In 
this definition Sayers has emphasized the transactions from debts which 
are raised by a financial institution 
According to the Indian Banking Company Act    A banking 
company means any company which transacts the business of banking 
Banking means accepting for the purpose of lending or investment  of 
deposits of money from the public  repayable on demand or other wise 
and withdrawable by cheque  draft or otherwise This definition throws 
light on the three major functions of a bank  They are 
 i  Accepting of deposits and lending loans 
 ii  Issue and pay cheques 
 iii  Collect cheques on behalf of the customers 
A bank is a financial institution that provides banking and other 
financial services to their customers  A bank is an institution which 
provides fundamental banking services such as accepting deposits and 
lending loans  As financial intermediaries  banks stand between depositors 
who supply capital and borrowers who demand capital  When banks accept 
deposits its liabilities increase and it becomes a debtor  but when it makes 
advances its assets increases and it becomes a creditor 
Banks are a subset of the financial services industry  The banks 
are the main participants of the financial system in India  All the banks 
safeguard the money and valuables and provide loans  credit  and payment 
services  such as money orders  and cheques  The banks also offer 
investment and insurance products 
Due to the emergence of integration among finance industries 
some of the traditional distinctions between banks  insurance companies 
and securities firms have diminished and they have converted themselves 
into Universal Banks to offer a variety of services under one umbrella 
 Notes 
Example  IDBI Bank and ICICI  In spite of these changes  banks continue 
to maintain and perform their primary role accepting deposits and 
lending funds from these deposits 
History of Modern Banking in India 
Modern Banking in India originated in the last decades of the  th 
century  The first banks were The General Bank of India  which started in 
  and Bank of Hindustan  which started in   both are now defunct 
The oldest bank still in existence in India is the State Bank of India  which 
originated in the Bank of Calcutta in June   which almost immediately 
became the Bank of Bengal  This was one of the three presidency banks 
the other two being the Bank of Bombay and the Bank of Madras  all 
three of which were established under charters from the British East India 
Company  For many years the presidency banks acted as quasi-central 
banks  as did their successors  The three banks merged in   to form 
the Imperial Bank of India  which  upon India s independence  became the 
State Bank of India in  
In April   the Reserve Bank of India was established  At the time 
of first phase the progress of banking sector was very sluggish  Between 
  and  there were around   small banks in India  To reform 
the working and activities of commercial banks  the Government of India 
came up with the Banking Companies Act    which was later changed 
to Banking Regulation Act   as per amending Act of    Act No 
of   Reserve Bank of India was vested with extensive powers for the 
supervision of banking in India as a Central Banking Authority 
After independence  Government has taken most important steps 
in regard of Indian Banking Sector reforms  In   the Imperial Bank of 
India was nationalized and was given the name  State Bank of India  to act 
as the principal agent of RBI and to handle banking transactions all over 
the country  It was established under State Bank of India Act    Seven 
banks forming subsidiary of State Bank of India was nationalized in 
According to the Banking Companies  Acquisition and Transfer 
of Undertakings  Bill    the objective and reasons for bank 
nationalization are   The banking system touches the lives of millions and 
has to be inspired by large social purposes and has to sub-serve national 
 Notes 
priorities and objectives  such as rapid growth in agriculture  small 
industries and exports  raising of employment levels  encouragement of 
new entrepreneurs and the development of the backward areas   For this 
purpose  it is necessary for the Government to take direct responsibility for 
the extension and diversification of banking services and for the working 
of the substantial part of the banking system 
On  th July      major Indian commercial banks of the 
country were nationalized  In   another six banks were nationalized 
and thus raising the number of nationalized banks to  Seven more banks 
were nationalized with deposits over   Crores  Later on  in the year 
  the government merged New Bank of India with Punjab National 
Bank  It was the only merger between nationalized banks and resulted in 
the reduction of the number of nationalized banks from   to   Till the 
year  approximately   of the banking segment in India was under 
government s ownership  On the suggestions of Narsimhan Committee 
the Banking Regulation Act was amended in   and hence  the gateways 
for the new private sector banks were opened 
The following are the major steps taken by the Government of 
India to Regulate Banking institutions in the country - 
     
  Enactment of Banking Regulation Act 
     
 Nationalization of State Bank of India 
     
  Nationalization of SBI subsidiaries 
     
  Insurance cover extended to deposits 
     
 Nationalisation of   major Banks 
     
  Creation of Credit Guarantee Corporation 
     
  Creation of Regional Rural Banks 
     
 Nationalisation of seven banks with deposits over   Crores 
In the early  s  the then Narsimha Rao government embarked 
on a policy of liberalisation  licensing a small number of private banks 
These came to be known as New Generation tech-savvy banks  and 
included Global Trust Bank  the first of such new generation banks to be 
set up  which later amalgamated with Oriental Bank of Commerce  Axis 
Bank earlier as UTI Bank  ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank

Figure showing the Functions of Bank 
The functions of commercial banks can be broadly categorized into 
a  Primary functions 
b  Secondary functions 
Primary Functions 
Following are the primary functions rendered by banks 
Accepting of Deposits 
The primary function of commercial banks is to accept money from 
the people in the form of deposits which are usually repayable on demand 
or after the expiry of a fixed period  For these deposits  the banks pay a 
rate of interest  which is called as interest expenditure  Thus  banks act 
as a custodian of depositors  funds  The deposits may be of various types 
such as savings deposits  current deposits  fixed deposits and recurring 
deposits 
Savings deposits encourage customers to save money and promote 
banking habit among the public  Savings Bank accounts provide a low rate 
of interest and they have restrictions on the number of withdrawals by the 
 Notes 
customers  The SB accounts can be opened in single or joint names  People 
who prefer these savings bank accounts include salary and wage earners 
Now  all the banks allow customers to open a savings bank account with 
nil balance 
Current Deposit accounts are opened by business people  These 
accounts have no restrictions on the number of withdrawals and are 
subject to service changes  There is no interest payment but current 
account holders can also avail the benefits such as overdraft and cash 
credit facilities 
Fixed deposits accounts can be opened by any person who wants 
to deposit a lump sum funds at one time for a specific time period  These 
accounts provide higher rate of interest depending on the time period for 
which it is deposited  These accounts do not allow withdrawal before the 
expiry of the period 
Recurring deposit accounts are normally opened and operated by 
persons who get regular income such as salary class and petty shop owners 
A specific amount of money is deposited periodically  say  monthly for a 
specific period  say  one year  These accounts provide higher rate of interest 
and do not allow withdrawal before the expiry of the period 
Lending Loans and Advances 
The second primary function of commerce bank is to lend loans 
and advances to the corporate sector and households  Normally  the rate of 
interest levied on these loans and advances is higher than what it pays on 
deposits  The interest income is the major source of income for commercial 
banks  The difference in the interest rates  Interest Received and Interest 
Paid  is called Interest Spread  which contributes to its profitability  Apart 
from leading  the banks usually keep some portion of funds to meet the 
demands of depositors and running expenses  The various types of loans 
and advances include overdraft  cash credit  loans  discounting of bills of 
exchange 
Over Draft  OD  is a facility extended by banks to the current 
account holders who maintain their accounts for business purposes  In 
this facility  the current account holders can withdraw more money from 
 Notes 
their accounts than what they maintain as balance  Under this facility 
banks honour the cheques drawn by the customers of the current account 
even if sufficient money is not available in their account  This overdrawing 
limit will be fixed by the banks for a certain period  based on the credit 
quality of the current account holders and their history of dealing with the 
bank  The amount overdrawn will be considered as loan and interest will 
be charged on the actual amount withdrawn 
Cash Credit  CC  is a facility extended by banks to current 
account holders and other who do not have account  In this facility  banks 
sanction a credit limit to a borrower for a certain period  usually for a 
longer period than overdraft  after verifying the credit worthiness  history 
of bank dealings and the track record of business  Normally banks expect 
security of tangible assets  such as stock of inventory  and or guarantees 
for sanction cash credit facility  Interest will be charged on the portion 
of amount withdrawn from the cash credit account but not on the entire 
amount sanctioned to the borrower 
Loans are normally sanctioned for a short term period  say one 
year  or medium term  say three to five years  At present  banks lend long 
term loans also  Repayment of loan will be made in various installments 
 say monthly  quarterly  semiannually  annually  over a specific period of 
time or in a lump sum  Banks charge interest on the actual amount of loan 
sanctioned and rate of interest is somewhat lower than what is charged 
on OD or CC facility  Regarding the collateral  security  banks expect 
some tangible assets  like stock of raw materials  finished goods  from the 
borrower  There are various types of loans such as secured loans  mortgage 
loans  educational loans  personal loans  etc 
Examples for secured loans include two wheeler loans to the 
individuals  working capital loans to the business firms  etc  Mortgage 
loans are given to the borrowers to purchase immovable tangible assets 
such as land  buildings  homes  etc  with a lien charge on the asset which 
will serve as collateral  At present  majority of the banks are granting 
home loans to the customers  Educational loans for higher studies and 
professional courses are given by banks to the students at a reasonable 
rate of interest  Personal Loans  Consumer finance  for individuals are 
provided on easy terms and conditions to buy consumer durables like TV 
refrigerators  etc 
 Notes 
Discounting of Bill of Exchange is another method of granting 
advances to the traders  The banks can advance funds by purchasing or 
discounting the bills from traders which arise from trade  Trade bills are 
those bills which emerge due to credit sale to customers  If the traders 
require money before the expiry of the bills  they can discount the bills with 
the banks  The banker will pay an amount to the drawer or beneficiary of 
the bill  usually trader who sold goods on credit basis to customers  after 
deducting the discount amount  On maturity of the bill  the banker will 
receive the amount from the drawee or acceptor of the bill  the customer 
who bought goods on credit terms 
Secondary Functions 
Following are the secondary functions performed by the banks 
Besides the primary functions of accepting deposits and lending 
loans and advances  banks perform various other functions  which are 
called secondary functions  They include agency functions and utility 
functions 
Agency Functions 
The banks act as agent of their customers and perform a number 
of agency functions which include transfer of funds  collection of cheques 
periodic payment  periodic collections  portfolio management and other 
agency functions 
Transfer of Funds is made by banks from one branch to another or 
from one place to another for customers  At present  banks use technology 
and telecommunication systems to facilitate these transfers  Example 
Electronic fund transfers  EFT  For this service  banks collect service 
charges 
Collection of Cheques is facilitated by banks through clearing 
section  Thus  the cheques deposited or presented for collection are 
credited to the customers  account once they collect the same through 
clearing process  This includes the cheques of the same bank or other 
banks and within the station and outstation  For providing this service 
they charge collection charges which are very nominal 
 Notes 
Periodic Payments such as payment of public utility bills  rent 
interest  etc  are made by banks on behalf of the customers based on 
their standing instructions  A specific example  Payment of housing loan 
interest from salary account

are allowed by RBI  They will act as deal makers or traders depending on 
their position

customers  Many corporate which take up projects and look for financial 
assistance have to prepare project reports for submitting the same to the 
Financial Institutions or Banks  This project report preparation requires 
expertise personnel which the banks possess  Banks collect consultancy

Figure showing the Types of Banks 
Let us now discuss the meaning of each one of them 
Based on the Structure or Organizational Setup 
Banks can be of five types based on the structure or organizational 
setup  viz  unit bank  branch bank  group bank  chain bank and 
correspondent bank 
  Unit Bank is a type of bank under which the banking operations 
are carried by a single branch with a single office and they limit 
their operations to a limited area  Normally  unit banks may not 
have any branch or it may have one or two branches  This unit 
banking system has its origin in United State of America  USA  and 
 Notes 
each unit bank has its own shareholders and board of management 
In USA  each State may have many unit banks but each unit bank 
limits its operation within the State or country  There may be many 
central banks and they control the unit banks operating in their 
States  Collectively the central banks are called Federal Reserve 
Banks 
  Branch Bank is a type of banking system under which the banking 
operations are carried with the help of branch network and the 
branches are controlled by the Head Office of the bank through their 
zonal or regional offices  Each branch of a bank will be managed by 
a responsible person called branch manager who will be assisted by 
the officers  clerks and sub-staff  In England and India  this type of 
branch banking system is in practice  In India  State Bank of India 
 SBI  is the biggest public sector bank with a very wide network of 
  branches 
  Group Bank is a system of banking under which there will be 
holding company controlling the subsidiary companies which 
carry out banking business  In some cases  both the holding and 
subsidiary companies may carry out banking business  An apt 
example in India is SBI which has many subsidiary banks such as 
State Bank of Mysore  State Bank of Indore  State Bank of Hyderabad 
State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur  State Bank of Patiala and State 
Bank of Travancore  These subsidiaries carry out banking and other 
operations such as leasing  merchant banking and so on 
  Chain Bank is a system under which different banks come under 
a common control through common shareholders or by the inter- 
locking of directors  An apt example in India is KarurVysya Bank 
and Lakshmi Vilas Bank having their head offices located in the 
same place  viz  Karur and sharing common directors by which 
they may have common management policy 
  Correspondent Bank is a bank which link two banks of different 
stature or size  Many Indian banks act as correspondent banks for 
many foreign banks 
 Notes 
Based on the Ownership 
Banks can be of four types based on the ownership  They are public 
sector banks  private sector banks  foreign banks and cooperative banks 
  Public Sector Banks are those banks in which majority stake 
 i e  more than   of the shares  is held by the government of 
the country  The words such as  The  or  Ltd  will not be found 
in their names because the ownership of these banks are with the 
government and the liability is unlimited in nature  Some examples 
of public sector banks in India include Andhra Bank  Canara Bank 
Union Bank of India  Allahabad Bank  Punjab National Bank 
Corporation Bank  Indian Bank and so on 
  Private Sector Banks are those banks which are owned by group of 
private shareholders  They elect board of directors which manages 
the affairs of the banks  Some examples of private banks in India 
include The Lakshmi Vilas Bank Ltd  The Karur Vysya Bank Ltd 
The City Union Bank Ltd  HDFC Bank  Axis Bank and son 
  Foreign Banks are those banks which belong to foreign countries 
and have their incorporated head office in foreign countries and 
branch offices in other countries  The share capital of the foreign 
banks will be fully contributed by the foreign investors  Some 
examples of foreign banks in Indian include ABM Amro bank 
Standard Chartered Bank  JP Morgan Chase Bank and so on 
  Cooperative Banks are those banks which are run by following 
cooperative principles of service motive  Their main motive is not 
profit making but to help the weaker sections of the society  Some 
examples of cooperative banks in India include Central Cooperative 
Banks  State Cooperative Banks 
Based on the Functions 
Banks can be of various types based on the functions they perform 
They include savings banks  commercial banks  industrial banks 
agricultural development banks  land mortgage development banks 
cooperative banks  exchange banks  indigenous banks  consumer banks 
central banks 
 Notes 
  Saving Banks are established to encourage savings habit among 
the people  There are no separate banks called savings banks but 
postal department perform the functions of savings bank  People 
can save even very small amount in these banks and these banks 
discourage withdrawals by limiting the number of withdrawals 
during a year  The amount collected from the customers is invested 
in securities such as bonds  government securities  etc  The main 
objective of these banks is to promote thrift and savings among the 
people  People who prefer these banks include salaried people and 
low income groups  At present  in India all the commercial banks 
act as savings banks besides providing various other services 
  Commercial Banks are established to help the people who carry 
out trade and commerce  i e  businessmen  They mobilize deposits 
from public and lend short-term loans to businessmen in the form 
of overdrafts  cash credit  etc for their commercial activities  As the 
commercial activities are of paramount importance to economic 
development  the commercial banks play a key role in promoting 
commercial activities in the country  Normally they do not provide 
long-term loans but provide short to medium term loans to traders 
for their working capital needs  Apart from lending  they also 
provide a host of services such as cheque collection  discounting 
bills of exchange  facilitating money transfer  etc  These commercial 
banks are subject to Reserve Bank of India s regulation 
  Industrial Banks   Investment Banks are those banks which provide 
long term loans to industries for the purpose of expansion and 
modernization  They raise capital by issue of shares and debentures 
and provide long term loans to industries  These banks are also 
responsible for the development of backward areas for which they 
promote industries in those places  In India  examples for industrial 
banks include Industrial Finance Corporation of India  IFCI 
earlier Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India 
 ICICI- Now universal bank  and earlier Industrial Development 
Bank of India  IDBI-now universal bank  Investment bank is a 
financial and banking organization  which provides both financial 
as well as advisory banking services to their clients  Besides this 
they also deal with research  marketing and sales of a range of 
financial products like commodities  currency  credit  equities etc 
As investment banks  they contribute to share capital and or take 
 Notes 
part in capital issue management for promoting the companies by 
underwriting their issues and facilitate public to buy those shares 
The industrial activities are promoted by these banks and they also 
mobilize long term deposits  In India  Bank of America  JP Morgan 
and BNP Paribas are some of the leading investment banks 
  Agricultural Land Development Banks are those banks which 
are known as Land Mortgage or Agricultural Banks as they provide 
finance to agricultural sector  They provide long term loan for 
agriculture for the purposes of purchase of new land  purchase of 
heavy agricultural machinery such as tractor  repayment of old debt 
conservation of soil and reclamation of loans  In India  Government 
of India has guaranteed the debentures issued by agricultural 
land development banks  In Tamil Nadu  we have Tamil Nadu 
Cooperative Land Development bank  They follow the principles of 
cooperative banks and help the weaker sections  Commercial banks 
do not take active part as they view agricultural financing as risky 
one and hence  Agricultural Development Banks play a key role in 
this activity 
  Co-operative Banks are those banks which are registered under the 
Cooperative Societies Act   These banks collect share capital 
from the public and lend to economically weaker sections  They 
provide financial assistance to farmers  salaried class  small scale 
industries  etc  They can be found in rural and urban areas and the 
functions are similar to commercial banks except that they charge 
less interest for the loans and advances 
  Regional Rural Banks are those banks which are established by 
the Government under the Regional Rural Banks Act of  
with a specific purpose to provide credit and other facilities to the 
small and marginal farmers  agricultural labourers  artisans and 
small entrepreneurs in rural areas  Each RRB operates within the 
specified local areas 
  Exchange Banks are also called as foreign exchange banks and 
they are incorporated outside the country but carry out business 
in India  They provide foreign exchange subject to the rules and 
regulations of the country in which they are operating  They also 
provide finance to exporters and letter of credit guarantee to 
 Notes 
importers  They help in remitting of funds from one country to 
another country  discount foreign bills  buy and sell gold silver 
promote foreign trade  Examples of exchange bank include Bank of 
America  Hong Kong Bank  etc 
  Indigenous Banks refer to money lenders and Sahukars  The 
money lenders using their own funds and deposits mobilized from 
public  grant loans to the needy people  They are more popular in 
villages and small towns  Usually  they act as traders and bankers 
simultaneously  In India  we have well known Indian communities 
such as Marwaries  Multani run their indigenous banks 
  Consumers Banks operate only in advanced countries like USA 
and Germany  The primary objective of these banks is to provide 
loans to customers to purchase consumer durables like Car  TV 
Washing Machine  Furniture  etc  The consumers repay the loans 
in easy installments 
  Central   Federal   National Bank is a leader of all the banks in a 
country  Every county has a central bank  The prime responsibility of 
a Central Bank is to regulate the banking system and control mon- 
etary policy  These banks are called as banker to the bankers as they 
give financial accommodation to commercial banks  They are non- 
profit making institutions and they also act as banker to the gov- 
ernment  issue currency notes  etc  They maintain foreign exchange 
reserves of the country and all the government accounts are main- 
tained with them  They help in money circulation in the economy 
and provide financial accommodation to the government in case of 
necessity through purchase of treasury bills in the money market  In 
India  Reserve Bank of India  in USA  Federal Reserve  a group of 
central banks  in UK  Bank of England are the central banks 
Conclusion

Introduction 
The structure of banking system varies from country to country 
depending on the regulatory regime  Nationalization was a structural 
change in the functioning of commercial banks which resulted in to the 
emergence of public sector banks  Privatization led to the emergence of 
private sector banks and globalization facilitated the entry of foreign banks 
in India  The banking system in India is significantly different from that 
of other Asian nations because of the country s unique geographic  social 
and economic characteristics  India has a large population and land size 
a diverse culture  and extreme disparities in income  which are marked 
among its regions  In this lesson  we will learn the structure of banking 
system in India

Reserve Bank of India 
Reserve Bank of India is the central bank of India  It was established 
in   and started its operations with effect from April     It is 
responsible for guiding and regulating the banking system of a country

It maintains the government records relating to revenue and expenditure 
under various heads  It advises the government on monetary and credit 
policies and decides on the interest rates applicable to bank deposits and 
loans and advances  We will learn the structure and functions of central 
bank in the next unit 
 Notes 
Scheduled Banks 
Scheduled banks are those banks which are included in the second 
Schedule of Reserve Bank of India Act   For this inclusion  the banks 
have to comply with the criteria laid down vide Section   of the RBI 
Act  Scheduled banks can be classified into scheduled commercial banks 
and scheduled commercial banks  The criteria for scheduled banks include 
the following 
 i  Has a paid- up capital and reserves of an aggregate value of not less 
than five lakhs of rupees 
 ii  Satisfies the RBI that its affairs are not being conducted in a 
manner detrimental to the interest of its depositors 
 iii  Is a State co- operative bank or a company as defined in section  
of the Companies Act      of     or an institution notified 
by the Central Government in this behalf or a corporation or a 
company incorporated by or under any law in force in any place 
outside India 
Scheduled banks can be divided into scheduled commercial banks 
and scheduled cooperative banks 
a  Scheduled Commercial Banks 
Scheduled commercial Banks are those banks which accept 
deposits and lend short-term loans and advances to their customers  After 
few banks emerged as Universal Banks  they started granting medium 
and long-term loans as well  They are the bedrock of the Indian financial 
system and account for three fourths of the financial market  They are 
present throughout India and their branch network has grown four folds 
in the last   years  The branch network of commercial banks has crossed 
now   branches 
The scheduled commercial banks are classified into the three types 
viz  public sector banks  private sector banks  foreign banks and regional 
rural banks 
 Notes 
i  Public Sector Banks are those banks in which the majority of the 
shareholding is held by the Government of India and they are major 
constituent of Indian Banking System  At present as on  - - 
there are   public sector banks functioning in India  They are 
categorized into SBI and its   associates of SBI    nationalized banks 
and IDBI Bank Ltd 
Public sector banks have assumed the lead role in expansion of 
branch network all over the country  especially in the rural areas  They 
account for   of branch network of scheduled commercial banks in 
  The number of branches has increased from   in   to  
in   Their presence in the rural areas is remarkable 
State Bank of India and its associates  In   when the First 
Five Year Plan was launched  the development of rural India was given 
the highest priority  The commercial banks of the country including the 
Imperial Bank of India had till then confined their operations to the 
urban sector and were not equipped to respond to the emergent needs of 
economic regeneration of the rural areas  In order  therefore  to serve the 
economy in general and the rural sector in particular  the All India Rural 
Credit Survey Committee recommended the creation of a state-partnered 
and state-sponsored bank by taking over the Imperial Bank of India  and 
integrating with it  the former state-owned or state-associate banks 
An act was accordingly passed in Parliament in May   and the 
State Bank of India was constituted on   July   More than a quarter of 
the resources of the Indian banking system thus passed under the direct 
control of the State  Later  the State Bank of India  Subsidiary Banks  Act 
was passed in   enabling the State Bank of India to take over eight 
former State-associated banks as its subsidiaries  later named Associates 
The State Bank of India was thus born with a new sense of social 
purpose aided by the   offices comprising branches  sub offices and 
three Local Head Offices inherited from the Imperial Bank  The concept 
of banking as mere repositories of the community s savings and lenders 
to creditworthy parties was soon to give way to the concept of purposeful 
banking sub serving the growing and diversified financial needs of planned 
economic development  The State Bank of India was destined to act as 
the pacesetter in this respect and lead the Indian banking system into the 
exciting field of national development 
 Notes 
As of March     the Bank had a network of   branches 
including   branches of its five associate banks  In addition to banking 
the Company  through its various subsidiaries  provides a range of 
financial services  which include life insurance  merchant banking  mutual 
funds  credit card  factoring  security trading  pension fund management 
custodial services  general insurance  non-life insurance  and primary 
dealership in the money market 
Its segments include Treasury  which includes investment portfolio 
and trading in foreign exchange contracts and derivative contracts 
Corporate Wholesale Banking  which comprises lending activities of 
Corporate Accounts Group  Mid Corporate Accounts Group and Stressed 
Assets Management Group  Retail Banking  which comprises of branches 
in National Banking Group  which includes personal banking activities 
including lending activities to corporate customers  and Other Banking 
Business  To make SBI a global power house  the Government has plans to 
merge SBI associates with SBI in the near future 
Nationalised Banks have contributed a lot for the growth of 
economy of India and they dominate the Indian Banking System  The 
major objectives of nationalization of commercial banks were to provide 
social welfare  control of private monopolies  and expansion of banking 
reduction of regional imbalance  provision of priority sector lending and 
creation of banking habits 
They were established with great purpose to make wide reach of 
banking activity including rural areas  They are fully committed to offer 
the best possible service to the rural community  They are recognized for 
their transparency in service and financial reporting  At present  they have 
started diversifying their services and cross sell products of other financial 
intermediaries  For example  Bancassurance is one such product  in which 
a bank will sell the insurance product of an insurance company 
Industrial Development Bank of India Ltd   IDBI  is today one 
of India s largest commercial Banks  For over   years  IDBI Bank has 
played a key nation-building role  first as the apex Development Financial 
Institution  DFI   July     to September     in the realm of 
industry and thereafter as a full-service commercial Bank  October    
onwards  As a DFI  the erstwhile IDBI stretched its canvas beyond mere 
 Notes 
project financing to cover an array of services that contributed towards 
balanced geographical spread of industries  development of identified 
backward areas  emergence of a new spirit of enterprise and evolution of a 
deep and vibrant capital market 
On October     the erstwhile IDBI converted into a Banking 
company  as Industrial Development Bank of India Limited  to undertake 
the entire gamut of Banking activities while continuing to play its secular 
DFI role  Post the mergers of the erstwhile IDBI Bank with its parent 
company  IDBI Ltd  on April      appointed date  October    
and the subsequent merger of the erstwhile United Western Bank Ltd  with 
IDBI Bank on October     the tech-savvy  new generation Bank with 
majority Government shareholding today touches the lives of millions of 
Indians through an array of corporate  retail  SME and Agri products and 
services  Headquartered in Mumbai  IDBI Bank today rides on the back 
of a robust business strategy  a highly competent and dedicated workforce 
and a state-of-the-art information technology platform  to structure and 
deliver personalized and innovative Banking services and customized 
financial solutions to its clients across various delivery channels 
As on March     IDBI Bank has a balance sheet of  
lakh crore and business size  deposits plus advances  of   lakh crore 
As a Universal Bank  IDBI Bank  besides its core banking and project 
finance domain  has an established presence in associated financial 
sector businesses like Capital Market  Investment Banking and Mutual 
Fund Business  Going forward  IDBI Bank is strongly committed to work 
towards emerging as the  Bank of choice  and  the most valued financial 
conglomerate  besides generating wealth and value to all its stakeholders 
ii  Private Sector Banks  are those banks in which the majority of the 
shareholding is held by private individuals and corporate 
Old Generation Private Banks 
When nationalization of banks took place in two periods  viz   
and   not all the private banks were nationalized  The banks which 
were not nationalized remain private banks and they are named as old 
generation private sector banks  There are   old generation private banks 
operating in India 
 Notes 
New Generation Private Banks 
With the introduction of new economic policies in   the Reserve 
Bank of India issued guidelines in   and   to give licences to new 
private banks with a capital introduction of     crore    banks were 
set up after   and another   after the   guidelines  Of these   new 
private banks  four were promoted by development financial institutions 
one each by conversion of a co-operative bank and an NBFC  non- 
banking financial institutions  into commercial banks  five by banking 
professionals  and one by a media house  However  due to various reasons 
including lack of financial strength and bad governance  a lot of mergers 
took place and presently there are only   new private banks operating 
in India  The branch network of private sector banks  both new and old 
generation banks  has increased from   in   to   in  
The role of private sector banks in Indian economy is commendable 
and they provide high degree of professional management  create health 
competition  encourage foreign investment  help to access foreign capital 
markets and help to develop innovation and achieve expertise  They used 
technology and led the other banks in various new business lines such 
as credit card  ATM and computerized operations  Undoubtedly  being 
tech-savvy and full of expertise  private banks have played a major role 
in the development of Indian banking industry  They have made banking 
more efficient and customer friendly  In the process  they have shaken 
public sector banks out of complacency and compelled them to become 
more competitive  Now  the RBI wants to liberalize its licensing policy to 
allow industrial and business houses to float their own banks  The latest 
Banking Bill envisaged to increase the cap on voting rights for investors in 
private sector lenders to   per cent from   per cent and in public sector 
banks  PSU  banks  the cap on voting rights has been raised to   per cent 
from   per cent 
iii   Foreign Banks are those banks which have their registered and 
incorporated head office in a foreign country but have their branch 
offices operating in India  RBI permits the foreign banks to operate 
either through their branches or wholly owned subsidiaries  Corporate 
segment has been the main business line of most of the foreign banks 
operating in India  In the recent years  some of the foreign banks have 
started providing consumer financing such as home loans  automobile 
 Notes 
finance  credit cards  household consumer finance  They are subject 
to all RBI regulations  including priority sector lending norms  which 
are applicable to domestic banks  The latest bill on banking will allow 
foreign banks to convert their Indian operations into local subsidiaries 
or transfer shareholding to a holding company of the bank without 
paying stamp duty  At present  foreign banks operate through their 
representative offices and branches in India 
iv   Regional Rural Banks  RRBs  are those banks which were established 
in   under the provisions of the Ordinance promulgated on the 
 th September   and the Regional Rural Banks Act    with 
a view to develop the rural economy and to create a supplementary 
channel to the  Cooperative Credit Structure  with a view to enlarge 
institutional credit for the rural and agriculture sector  The share 
capital of RRB is contributed by the Government of India  the 
concerned State Government and the sponsoring public sector banks 
in the ration of     and   respectively  The area of operation 
of the RRBs is limited to notified few districts in a State  The RRBs 
mobilize deposits primarily from rural semi-urban areas and provide 
loans and advances mostly to small and marginal farmers  agricultural 
labourers  rural artisans and other segments of priority sector  The 
Government of India initiated a process of structural consolidation 
of RRBs by amalgamating RRBs sponsored by the same bank within a 
State  with a view to provide better customer service by having better 
infrastructure  computerization  experienced work force  common 
publicity and marketing efforts etc  The amalgamated RRBs also 
benefit from larger area of operation  enhanced credit exposure limits 
for high value and diverse banking activities 
RRBs were also permitted to decide the need for conversion of the 
existing loss making branches into satellite   mobile offices keeping in 
view the cost-benefit aspect  the likely inconvenience that may be caused 
to the existing clientele  the effect of the conversion on the performance 
in the preparation of district credit plan and priority sector lending  With 
a view to providing better customer service in rural areas  RRBs may also 
convert their satellite offices into full-fledged branches after obtaining 
concurrence from their board and necessary licence from the concerned 
Regional Office of RBI  As a result of the amalgamation  the number of the 
RRBs has been reduced from   to   as on   March   The number 
of branches of RRBs increased to   in  
 Notes 
b  Scheduled Cooperative Banks 
Scheduled Cooperative Banks are those banks in which individuals 
that have common interest of carrying out banking business by following 
the principles of cooperation form a cooperative society under the 
Cooperative Societies Act  However  the RBI s permission has to be obtained 
before starting the banking business by the cooperative society  The 
cooperative banks function under the overall supervision of the Registrar 
and Cooperative Societies of the State  besides following the guidelines 
issued by the RBI for banking business  They cater to the financial needs 
of agriculture  small industry  retail  and trade  self-employed traders in 
urban  semi-urban and rural areas  They are heterogeneous in nature and 
their structures differ across urban and rural areas  across states and loan 
tenures  Due to their widespread geographical penetration  they have the 
prospect to become an important tool for large scale financial inclusion 
provided their financial stability is taken care of  RBI and National Bank 
for Agriculture and Rural Development  NABARD  have taken a lot of 
reform measures to improve the financial soundness of the cooperative 
banks  They form the oldest segment of the Indian Banking System  The 
cooperative banks can be scheduled or non-scheduled  At present  there 
are   non-scheduled urban cooperative banks operating in India  The 
scheduled cooperative banks can further be classified in to two types  viz 
urban cooperative banks and State Cooperative Banks 
i  Urban Co-operative Banks are federation of primary cooperative 
societies  which are at village or town level  in a particular area 
These banks function at the district level  When the memberships 
of central cooperative banks are restricted to primary cooperative 
societies  it is called as  banking union  At present  individuals are 
also permitted to become members of district or central cooperative 
banks  These banks provide loans to their members  i e  primary 
credit societies  and function as a link between the primary credit 
societies and state co-operative banks  They have on their boards of 
management  individuals who have business capacity and influence 
besides being a representative of primary societies  They can borrow 
money from NABARD for their operations  The source of funds for 
these banks includes share capital  reserves  deposits  loans from 
State Cooperative Banks or other banks  At present  there are  
urban scheduled cooperative banks operating in India 
 Notes 
ii  State Co-operative Banks are the apex  highest level  co-operative 
banks in all the States of India  They attract deposits from the 
rich urban classes and channelize among various sectors  Their 
constitution differs from one bank to the other  Nevertheless 
usually  the membership includes the representatives from central 
cooperative banks and individual shareholders  They provide 
rediscounting facilities  collect and disseminate useful information 
regarding cooperative movement  At present   state cooperative 
banks are operating in India 
Non-Scheduled Banks 
Non-scheduled bank in India  means a banking company as 
defined in clause  c  of section   of the Banking Regulation Act     
of   which is not a scheduled bank  They are not included in the 
list of scheduled banks  They function as Local Area Banks  They have to 
adhere to the Cash Reserve Ratio  CRR  condition but are not compelled 
to deposit these funds with the RBI  They are set up under the scheme 
announced by the government of India in   for the establishment of 
new private banks of a local nature  with jurisdiction over a maximum 
of three contiguous districts  Six LABs were originally licensed  but the 
license of one of them was cancelled due to irregularities in operations  and 
the other was amalgamated with Bank of Baroda in   due to its weak 
financial position  As at end-March   there were only   LABs operating 
in India  They get financial assistance from RBI only under emergency 
conditions and not for daily operations  They help in the mobilization of 
funds from rural and semi urban districts  At present  there are no non- 
scheduled banks exist 
Conclusion 
This chapter explained as how the structure of Indian Banking 
industry is fragmented  To become competitive in the global market  the 
structure of the Indian banking industry is to be consolidated and the 
Government of India is taking measures by consolidating few public sector 
banks into a global power house and by infusing the required capital

Lesson   - Banker and Customer Relationship 
Learning Objectives 
    To define  Banker  and  Customer 
    To understand the various kinds of relationship between banker 
and customer 
    To understand the duties of a banker 
Introduction 
Depending on the activities  products or services provided by the 
bank to its customers or availed by the customer  the relationship between 
a banker and a customer emerges  There exist a transactional relationship 
between a banker and customer  To understand the relationship between 
them  we must understand the terms   banker  and  customer  clearly 
Definition of a  Banker 
According to Banking Regulations Act    Section  b  Banking 
is defined as  accepting for the purpose of lending or investments of 
deposits of money received from the public and repayable on demand and 
withdrawable by cheque  draft  order or otherwise  Thus  the term banker 
is not defined by B R Act but it defines the term  Banking  This definition 
highlights two points 
   The primary function of a banker is accepting of deposits for the 
purpose of lending or investing the same 
   The amount deposited is repayable to the depositor on demand 
or according to the agreement  The demand for repayment can 
be made through a cheque  draft or otherwise  and not merely by 
verbal order  Let us see some definitions of Banker 
 Notes 
According to Dr  Herbert L  Heart   A Banker is one who in the 
ordinary course of business honours cheques drawn upon him by any 
persons from and for whom he receives money on current accounts 
According to Sec    of the Indian Negotiable Instruments Act  
the word  banker includes any person acting as banker and any post office 
savings bank 
According to Sec    of the Bill of Exchange Act     banker 
includes a body of persons  whether incorporated or not who carry on the 
business of banking 
From the above definitions  we can derive the meaning of banker 
as one who 
a  Accepts deposits from public 
b  Grants loans and advances 
c  Issue and pay cheques 
d  Collect cheques for his customers 
The word  public  implies that the banker accepts deposits from 
anyone who offers money for deposit purpose  For the purpose of 
receiving deposit  the customer has to open an account with the bank  For 
both depositing and borrowing funds  customer has to have an account 
relationship with the bank  The RBI has stipulated  Know Your Customer 
 KYC  Norms  for opening bank account and the bankers are strictly 
following the same  Hence  if a customer is not transparent  the banker 
has the right to rejects his her application 
Definition of a  Customer 
The term  Customer  is not defined by any act either in India or in 
English Statutes  The word  customer  has its origin from the word  custom 
which means a  habit or tendency  to-do certain things in a regular or 
a particular manner  Generally speaking  a customer is one who has an 
account with the bank or who utilizes the services of the bank 
Account relationship is a contractual relationship  It is generally 
believed that any individual or an organization  which conducts banking 
 Notes 
transactions with a bank  is the customer of bank  However  there are many 
persons who do utilize services of banks  but do not maintain any account 
with the bank  Therefore  bank customers can be conveniently classified 
into four types  They are 
a  Existing customers 
b  Former customers 
c  Customers for services like Demand Draft purchase  cheque 
encashment  etc 
d  Potential customers 
In the past  the customers have to deposit some amount as initial 
deposit to open a bank account  Later  as per the directions of RBI   No 
Frill  accounts were allowed by the banks without any deposit  ie  with 
nil balance or with meager balance  Now  all the banks are instructed by 
RBI to open as many bank accounts as possible without any balance  to 
channelize the benefits of government schemes to the public through 
Aadhar Card 
In the past  customers can have his transactions only with 
the branch with which they maintain their account  But  after the 
implementation of Core Banking Solution  Computerization of branches 
with interconnectivity  customers can operate their accounts from any 
branch of the bank and from anywhere  Thus  earlier system of  customer 
to a branch  is converted into  customer to a bank  However  for any 
specific claim or action  the customers have to approach the branch with 
which they maintain account 
Classification of Banker-Customer Relationship 
The relationship between a banker and customers can be broadly 
classified into 
a  General Relationship 
b   Special Relationship 
As per Sec  b  of Banking Regulation Act  the bank s business is to 
accept deposits for the purpose of lending  Thus  the relationship emerging 
out of these two main activities is called as General Relationship  As per 
 Notes 
Sec   of Banking Regulation Act  the banker undertakes other activities 
on behalf of the customer and provides lot of services to them  Thus  the 
relationship emerging out of the provision of these activities and services 
is called as Special Relationship 
General Relationship 
Under general relationship  the banker and customer may have 
two types of relationships  viz  debtor-creditor relationship and creditor- 
debtor relationship 
i  Debtor-Creditor Relationship  While opening a bank account 
customers fill and sign the account opening form to enter into 
an agreement contract with the banker  When the customers 
deposit money in their account  the relationship between banker 
and customer becomes that of debtor and creditor  The amount 
deposited becomes the banks  liability towards the customer and 
hence  he becomes debtor to the depositor  Customers  The 
banker can use that amount for any purpose  of course  with the 
information as to the use of money to the depositors  Normally 
banks do not give any security to the depositors  However  when it 
is demanded by the deposits  the banks have to pay  Joachimson vs 
Swiss Bank Corporation  Thus  the banker is completely different 
from normal debtors who voluntarily repay the debts  The rate of 
interest on the loan is normally decided by the creditor but in the 
banker-customer relationship the interest is decided by the banker 
who as a debtor pays interest once in six months on the deposits 
The banks need to pay the deposit amount to the depositors when 
the demand is made in the proper manner during working days and 
working hours  But  nowadays  Any Time Machines  Automatic 
Teller Machines  are used to pay the money  The customers get 
passbook which carries the account details and all the terms and 
conditions  Now  websites of the banks are used for transaction 
purposes also and customers can open their accounts online  When 
issuing demand draft  telegraphic transfer  bankers become debtors 
as they own money of the payee or beneficiary 
ii  Creditor Debtor  When banks grant loans and advances to the 
customers  the relationship between banker and customer is that of 
 Notes 
creditor-debtor relationship  Customers borrow money from bank 
by executing a contract with terms and conditions and by offering 
collateral  security  The customers  as debtors  are obliged to repay 
the loans and advances as per the terms of the contract 
Special Relationship 
In addition to opening of a deposit loan account banks provide 
variety of services  which makes the relationship more wide and complex 
Depending upon the type of services rendered and the nature of transaction 
the banker acts as a bailee  trustee  principal  agent  lessor  custodian etc 
i  Banker as a Trustee  As per Sec    of Indian Trust Act      A 
 trust  is an obligation annexed to the ownership of property  and 
arising out of a confidence reposed in and accepted by the owner 
or declared and accepted by him  for the benefit of another  or of 
another and the owner  Thus trustee is the holder of property on 
behalf of a beneficiary  As per Sec    of the  Indian Trust Act   
 A trustee is bound to deal with the trust-property as carefully as a 
man of ordinary prudence would deal with such property if it were 
his own  and  in the absence of a contract to the contrary  a trustee so 
dealing is not responsible for the loss  destruction or deterioration 
of the trust-property  A trustee has the right to reimbursement of 
expenses  Sec  of Indian Trust Act  In case of trust  banker- 
customer relationship is a special contract  When a customer 
entrusts valuable items with bank with an intention that such items 
would be returned on demand to the customer  the relationship 
becomes of a trustee and trustier  Customers keep certain valuables 
or securities with the bank for safekeeping or deposit certain money 
for a specific purpose  Escrow accounts  the banker in such cases 
acts as a trustee  Banks charge fee for safekeeping valuables

 bailor  The person to whom they are delivered is called  the  bailee 
Banks secure customer advances by obtaining tangible securities 
 Notes 
In some cases physical possession of securities goods  Pledge 
valuables  bonds etc  are taken  While taking physical possession of 
securities  the relationship between banker and customer becomes 
that of bailee and bailor  Banks also keeps articles  valuables 
securities etc  of its customers in Safe Custody and acts as a Bailee 
As a bailee  the bank is required to take care of the goods bailed

collateral to such contract  does or does not happen  It would thus 
be observed that banker customer relationship is transactional 
relationship 
Legal Relationship between Banker and Customer 
Trust is the basic requirement of bank-customer relationship  The 
relationship depends on the kind of transaction the customers have with 
the bank  It is based on contract with certain terms and conditions  It is 
a fiduciary relationship  The distinctive features of the legal relationship 
between the banker and the customer may be called as the duties  rights 
and liabilities of the banker 
Duties of the Banker 
The duties of the banker vis- -vis customer include the following 
i  Duty to honour cheques  As  banking  means accepting of deposits 
withdrawable by cheque  draft  order or otherwise  the banker is 
duty bound to honour cheques issued by the customers on their 
accounts  Sec   of Negotiable Instruments Act    specifies 
the liability of drawee of cheque  As per Sec     The drawee of a 
 Notes 
cheque having sufficient funds of the drawer in his hands properly 
applicable to the payment of such cheque must pay the cheque 
when duly required so to do  and  in  default of such payment 
must compensate the drawer for any loss or damage caused by such 
default  Thus  it is the duty of a bank to honour the cheques issued 
by the account holder if 
a  The cheque has been properly drawn and is in order in all 
respects i e  it is properly dated  amount in words and figures 
have been expressed properly  is neither state nor post-dated 
nor mutilated and the signature of accountholder tallies with 
the specimen recorded with the bank 
b  The cheque should be drawn on the branch where the account 
is maintained   Due to implementation of technology and 
core banking solution a customer can present cheques on any 
branch of a bank  RBI has advised banks to issue multi city 
cheques to account holders 
c  There is sufficient balance in the account and the balance is 
properly applicable for payment of the cheque 
d  The cheque is presented for payment on a working day and 
during the business hours of the branch 
e  Endorsements on the cheque are regular and proper 
f  The payment of the cheque is not countermanded by the 
drawer

usages customary among bankers  necessary or appropriate for the 
corresponding new bank to divulge such information  Maintaining

account  Bank has not only to maintain secrecy of transactions  but 
secrecy is also to be maintained in respect of operations through 
ATM  debit cards  Bank has also to maintain secrecy of user ID pins 
with due care so that it does fall in wrong hands 
 Notes

account or conduct of the account to any unauthorized person

Rights of the Banker 
The rights of the banker vis- -vis customer include the following 
Right of Lien  A lien is the right of a creditor in possession of 
goods  securities or any other assets belonging to the debtor to retain 
them until the debt is repaid  provided that there is no contract express or 
implied  to the contrary  It is a right to retain possession of specific goods 
or securities or other movables of which the ownership vests in some other 
person and the possession can be retained till the owner discharges the 
debt or obligation to the possessor  The creditor  bank  has the right to 
maintain the security of the debtor but not to sell it  There are two types 
of lien viz 
a   
Particular Lien 
b   
Right of General Lien 
Particular Lien 
A  particular lien  gives the right to retain possession only of those 
goods in respect of which the dues have arisen  It is also termed as ordinary 
lien  If the bank has obtained a particular security for a particular debt 
then the banker s right gets converted into a particular lien 
 Notes 
Right of General Lien 
Banker has a right of general lien against his borrower  General lien 
confers banks right in respect of all dues and not for a particular due  It is a 
statutory right of the bank and is available even in absence of an agreement 
but it does not confer the right to pledge  A  general lien  gives the right to 
retain possession of any goods in the legal possession of the creditor until 
the whole of the debt due from the debtor is paid  Section   of Indian 
Contract Act    confers the right of general lien to banks  As per the 
section  Bankers  factors  attorneys of a High Court and policy-brokers 
may  in the absence of a contract to the contrary  retain  as a security for a 
general balance of account any goods bailed to them  but no other persons 
have a right to retain  as a security for such balance  goods bailed to them 
unless there is an express contract to the effect Bank has a right of lien 
only when goods  securities are received in the capacity as a creditor  While 
granting advances banks take documents  These documents confer right 
to convert general lien as an implied pledge  A banker s lien is more than 
a general lien  it is an implied pledge and he has the right to sell the goods 
in case of default Bank has a  Right of Sale  of goods under lien  Banker s 
right of lien is not barred by the Law of Limitation 
Bank has the right of lien on goods and securities entrusted to him 
legally and standing in the name of the borrower  Bank can exercise right 
of lien on the securities in its possession for the dues of the same borrower 
even after the loan taken against that particular security has been re-paid 
Right of lien can be exercised on bills  cheques  promissory notes  share 
certificates  bonds  debentures etc 
Bank cannot exercise right of lien on goods received for safe 
custody  goods held in capacity as a trustee  or as an agent of the customer 
or left in bank by mistake 
Right of Set-Off  The banker has the right to set off the accounts of 
its customer  It is a statutory right available to a bank  to set off a debt owed 
to him by a creditor from the credit balances held in other accounts of the 
borrower  The right of set-off can be exercised only if there is no agreement 
express or implied to the contrary  This right is applicable in respect of 
dues that are due  are becoming due i e  certain and not contingent  It 
is not applicable on future debts  It is applicable in respect of deposits 
 Notes 
that are due for payment  The right of set off enables bank to combine 
all kinds of credit and debit balances of a customer for arriving at a net 
sum due  The right is also available for deposits kept in other branches 
of the same bank  The right can be exercised after death  insolvency  and 
dissolution of a company  after receipt of a garnishee attachment order 
The right is also available for time barred debts  Deposits held in the name 
of a guarantor cannot be set off to the debit balance in borrowers account 
until a demand is made to the guarantor and his liability becomes certain 
Banks cannot set off the credit balance of customer s personal account for 
a joint loan account of the customer with another person unless both the 
joint accountholders are jointly and severally liable  Banks exercise the 
Right of set off only after serving a notice on the customer informing him 
that the bank is going to exercise the right of set-off 
Depending on the situation  sometimes the set off takes place 
automatically without the permission from the customer  In the following 
events the set off happens automatically i e  without the permission from 
the customer 
a   On the death of the customer 
b   On customer becoming insolvent 
c   On receipt of a Garnishee order on customer s account by court

order is received by it 
 Notes 
Right of Appropriation  It is the right of the customers to direct 
his banker against which debt  when more than one debit outstanding  the 
payment made by him should be appropriated  In case no such direction is 
given  the bank can exercise its right of appropriation and apply it in payment 
of any debt  Section   and   of Indian Contract Act    lays down 
the rules of appropriation Sec Application of payment where debt to 
be discharged is indicated   i e  As per borrowers instructions Where 
a debtor  owing several distinct debts to one person  makes a payment to 
him  either with express intimation  or under circumstances implying that 
the payment is to be applied to the discharge of some particular debt  the 
payment  if accepted  must be applied accordingly Sec  Application of 
payment where debt to be discharged is not indicated   i e  in the absence 
of express or implied intention of debtor  Sec  of the Indian Contract 
Act states that if the debtor does not intimate or there is no circumstance 
of indicating how the payment is to be used  the right of appropriation is 
vested in the creditor 
According to the Act   Where the debtor has omitted to intimate and 
there are no other circumstances  indicating to which debt the payment is 
to be applied  the creditor may apply it at his discretion to any lawful debt 
actually due and payable to him from the debtor  whether its recovery is or 
is not barred by the law in force for the time being as to the limitation of 
suits Sec Application of payment where neither party appropriates 
Where neither party makes any appropriation the payment shall 
be applied in discharge of the debts in order of time  whether they are or 
are not barred by the law in force for the time being as to the limitation 
of suits  If the debts are of equal standing  the payment shall be applied 
in discharge of each proportionally  Unless there is an agreement to the 
contrary  any payment made by a debtor is applied first towards interest 
and thereafter towards principal  If a customer has only one account and 
he deposits and withdraws money from it regularly  the order in which the 
credit entry will set off the debit entry is in the chronological order  this is 
known as Clayton s rule 
Rule in Clayton s case  The rule was laid down in famous 
Devayanas Vs  Noble  The rule applies to running accounts like CC 
OD with debit balance  The rule states that each withdrawal in a debit 
account is considered as a new loan and each deposit as a repayment in 
that chronological order 
 Notes 
Right to Charge Interest  Commission  Incidental Charges etc 
Banker has an implied right to charge for services rendered and sold to a 
customer  Bank charges interest on amount advanced  processing charges 
for the advance  charges for non-utilization of credit facilities sanctioned 
charges commission  exchange  incidental charges etc  depending on 
the terms and conditions of advance banks charge interest at monthly 
quarterly or semiannually or annually  Banks charge customers if the 
balance in deposit account falls below the prescribed amount  Usually the 
bank informs such charges to the customer by various means 
Right to close the account of undesirable customers  Bankers 
have the right to close the accounts of the customer who is found unde- 
sirable in maintaining balance in the account and due to which frequent 
bouncing or dishonouring of cheques takes place  Due to this  the reputa- 
tion of the banker is getting affected  Thus  the banker  after giving due 
notification to the customer can close his account  In case of death  insol- 
vency  lunacy of customers or dissolution of firms or winding up of com- 
panies  the account will be closed by the banker 
Liabilities of the Banker

account with the consent of the customers  But  while disclosing the 
account  the banker should do so in a discrete manner without causing 
any prejudice to the credit worthiness of the customer  No bankers will

party and if the third party incurs any loss  he cannot make the banker 
liable  if banker 
a   Has disclosed bare factors without any intention 
b   That the banker has disclosed the details of customer s account 
unintentionally and without any motive to cause injury to third 
party 
However  a banker can be held liable criminally when he 
intentionally discloses

 Notes 
b   To cause damage to third party  If the above facts are proved in 
a court of law  the banker will be held liable criminally and will 
undergo penalty as well as imprisonment and the third party can 
also claim damages from the banker  for the losses suffered by 
relying on facts which are untrue

of a joint deposit account the nominee s right arises only after the death of 
all the depositors  Nomination facility is intended for individuals and sole 
proprietary concerns

norms at the time of opening of accounts  The objectives of the KYC are to 
ensure appropriate customer identification and to monitor transactions of 
a suspicious nature  While opening an account a bank is supposed to obtain 
all information necessary for establishing the identity legal existence of 
each new customer by taking and verifying the introductory reference from 
an existing account holder a person known to the bank or on the basis of 
documents provided by the customer  The means of establishing identity

Lesson   - Deposits  Loans   Advances and Assets   Liabilities 
Management of Banks 
Learning Objectives 
    To understand the various types of deposits and loans   advances 
    To understand the balance sheet of a bank 
    To understand the management of assets and liabilities of banks 
Introduction 
Financial intermediation by commercial banks has played a key role 
in India in supporting the economic growth process  An efficient financial 
intermediation process has two components  effective mobilization of 
savings and their allocation to the most productive uses  In this lesson 
let us discuss both the aspects besides knowing the balance sheet of a 
commercial bank and bank s financial management  viz  assets liabilities 
management  ALM 
Deposit Mobilization 
When banks mobilize savings  they do it in the form of deposits 
which are the money accepted by banks from customers to be held under 
stipulated terms and conditions  Deposits are thus an instrument of 
savings  Since the first episode of bank nationalization in   banks have 
been at the core of the financial intermediation process in India  They 
have mobilized a sizeable share of savings of the household sector  the 
major surplus sector of the economy 
This in turn has raised the financial savings of the household sector 
and hence the overall savings rate  Notwithstanding the liberalization of 
the financial sector and increased competition from various other saving 
instruments  bank deposits continue to be the dominant instrument of 
savings in India  The gross domestic savings of the Indian economy have 
been growing over the years and the household sector has been the most 
significant contributor to savings  Household sector saves in two major 
 Notes 
ways  viz  financial assets and physical assets  Within the financial savings 
of the household sector  bank deposits are the most prominent instrument 
accounting for nearly half of total financial savings of the household sector 
Bank Deposits 
One of the most important functions of any commercial bank is 
to accept deposits from the public  basically for the purpose of lending 
Deposits from the public are the principal sources of funds for banks and 
the public sector banks continue to dominate the Indian banking industry 
However  the share of the new private sector banks has been raising at the 
expense of the public sector banks  particularly in the last few years 
Safety of Bank Deposits 
At the time of depositing money with the bank  a depositor would 
want to be certain that his her money is safe with the bank and at the same 
time  wants to earn a reasonable return  The safety of depositors  funds 
therefore  forms a key area of the regulatory framework for banking  In 
India  this aspect is taken care of in the Banking Regulation Act     BR 
Act The RBI is empowered to issue directives advices on several aspects 
regarding the conduct of deposit accounts from time to time  Further 
the establishment of the Deposit Insurance Corporation in    against 
the backdrop of failure of banks  offered protection to bank depositors 
particularly small-account holders 
Rates of Interest 
The process of deregulation of interest rates started in April  
Until then  all interest rates were regulated  that is  they were fixed by the 
RBI  In other words  banks had no freedom to fix interest rates on their 
deposits  With liberalization in the financial system  nearly all the interest 
rates have now been deregulated  Now  banks have the freedom to fix their 
own deposit rates with only a very few exceptions  The RBI prescribes 
interest rates only in respect of savings deposits and NRI deposits  leaving 
others for individual banks to determine 
 Notes 
Deposit Policy 
The Board of Directors of a bank  along with its top management 
formulates policies relating o the types of deposit the bank should have 
rates of interest payable on each type  special deposit schemes to be 
introduced  types of customers to be targeted by the bank  etc  Of course 
depending on the changing economic environment  the policy of a bank 
towards deposit mobilization undergoes changes 
Types of Deposit Accounts 
The bank deposits can also be classified into  i  demand deposits 
and  b  time deposits 
 i  Demand deposits are defined as deposits payable on demand 
through cheque or otherwise  Demand deposits serve as a medium 
of exchange  for their ownership can be transferred from one person 
to another through cheques and clearing arrangements provided by 
banks  They have no fixed term to maturity 
 ii  Time deposits are defined as those deposits which are not payable 
on demand and on which cheques cannot be drawn  They have a 
fixed term to maturity 
Demand and time deposits are two broad categories of deposits 
There are several deposit accounts offered by banks in India  but they can 
be classified into three main categories 
  Savings bank account 
  Current account 
  Term deposit account 
Current account deposits fall entirely under the demand-deposit 
category and term deposit account falls entirely under time deposit  Savings 
bank accounts have both demand-deposit and time-deposit components 
In other words  some parts of savings deposits are considered demand 
deposits and the rest as time deposits 
 Notes 
Savings Bank Deposit 
Savings deposits are a form of demand deposits  which is subject 
to restrictions on the number of withdrawals as well as on the amounts 
of withdrawals during any specified period  Further  minimum balances 
may be prescribed in order to offset the cost of maintaining and servicing 
such deposits  Savings deposits are deposits that accrue interest at a fixed 
rate set by RBI  Savings bank accounts are used by a large segment of small 
depositors as they can deposit their regular incomes into these accounts 
withdraw the money on demand and also earn interest on the balance left 
in the account  The savings bank accounts cannot be opened by big trading 
or business firms  Similarly  institutions such as government departments 
and bodies  local authorities  etc  cannot open savings bank accounts 
Current Account Deposit 
A current account is a form of demand-deposit  as the banker is 
obliged to repay these liabilities on demands from the customer  Withdrawals 
from current accounts are allowed any number of times depending upon 
the balance in the account or up to a particular agreed amount  Current 
deposits are non-interest bearing  A current account is basically a running 
and actively operated account with very little restriction on the number 
and amount of drawings  The primary objective of a current account is 
to provide convenient operation facility to the customer  via continuous 
liquidity  On account of the high cost of maintaining such accounts  banks 
do not pay any interest on such deposits  In addition  many banks insist on 
customers maintaining minimum balances to offset the transaction costs 
involved  If minimum balances are not maintained  these banks charge 
the customers a certain amount  Current accounts can be opened by rich 
individuals  partnership firms  private and limited companies  Hindu 
Undivided Families  HUFs  societies  trusts  etc 
Savings account deposits together with current account deposits 
are called CASA deposits 
Term Deposit 
A  Term deposit  is a deposit received by the Bank for a fixed 
period  after which it can be withdrawn  Term deposits include deposits 
 Notes 
such as Fixed Deposits   Reinvestment deposits Recurring Deposits etc 
The term deposits account for the largest share of total deposits in the 
recent years  Interest is paid on term-deposits  either on maturity or at 
stipulated intervals depending upon the deposit scheme under which the 
money is placed  Also  a customer can earn interest on a term-deposit for 
a minimum period of   days  Interest rates on term-deposits are usually 
higher than on savings deposits  Term deposits include 
     
Fixed deposits on which a fixed rate of interest is paid at fixed 
regular intervals 
     
Re-investment deposits  under which the interest is compounded 
quarterly and paid on maturity  along with the principal amount 
of the deposit  Some banks have introduced  flexi  deposits under 
which  the amount in savings deposit accounts beyond a fixed limit 
is automatically converted into term-deposits  and 
     
Recurring deposits  under which a fixed amount is deposited at 
regular intervals for a fixed term and the repayment of principal 
and accumulated interest is made at the end of the term  These 
deposits are usually targeted at persons who are salaried or receive 
other regular income  A Recurring Deposit can usually be opened 
for any period from  months to   months 
Deposit Mobilization Strategies 
To maximize their profits  commercial banks always attempt to 
mobilize savings at the lowest cost possible  While mobilizing deposits 
banks have to comply with various directives issued by the RBI  the 
Indian Bank Association  IBA  Government of India and other statutory 
authorities agencies  At the same time  since banks operate in a very 
competitive environment  they have to reach out to a wide spectrum of 
customers and also offer deposit products that lead to higher customer 
satisfaction  Banks devise various strategies to expand the customer base 
and reducing the cost of raising deposits  This is done by identifying target 
markets  designing the products as per the requirements for customers 
taking measures for marketing and promoting the deposit products  It 
is essential not only to expand the customer base but also to retain it 
This is done by providing counseling  after-sales information and also 
through prompt handling of customer complaints  While the strategies for 
 Notes 
mobilizing bank deposits vary from bank to bank  one common feature 
is to maximize the share of CASA deposits  The other common features 
generally observed are as follows 
     
Staff members posted at branches are adequately trained to offer 
efficient and courteous service to the customers and to educate 
them about their rights and obligations 
     
A bank often offers personalized banking relationship for its high- 
value customers by appointing Customer Relationship Managers 
 CRMs 
     
Senior citizens pensioners have become an important category 
of customers to be targeted by a bank  Products are developed by 
banks to meet the specific requirements of this group 
     
While banks endeavour to provide services to the satisfaction of 
customers  they put in place an expeditious mechanism to redress 
the complaints of the customers 
Common Guidelines for Opening and Operating Deposit Accounts 
To open and operate a bank account  the following guidelines need 
to be followed 
Due Diligence Process 
Before opening any deposit account  the bank has to carry out due 
diligence as required under  Know Your Customer   KYC  guidelines 
issued by RBI and or such other norms or procedures adopted by the 
bank  The  due diligence  process  while opening a deposit account 
involves the bank having adequate knowledge of the person s identity 
occupation  sources of income  and location  Obtaining an introduction of 
the prospective depositor from a person acceptable to the bank  obtaining 
recent photographs of people opening operating the account are part of 
the due diligence process  For customers providing proof of identification 
and address  there is no need for personal introduction to the bank for 
opening of a new savings bank account  To promote financial inclusion 
in rural areas   tribal areas  KYC norms have been relaxed for below the 
poverty line  BPL  families 
 Notes 
Minimum Balance 
For deposit products like a savings bank account or a current 
account  banks normally stipulate certain minimum balances to be 
maintained as part of terms and conditions governing operation of such 
accounts  But for people below the poverty line  banks encourage the 
opening of  No-frills Accounts  typically a special savings bank account 
where no minimum balance requirement is required  For a savings bank 
account  the bank may also place restrictions on number of transactions 
cash withdrawals  etc  during a given period 
Transparency 
Failure to maintain minimum balance in the accounts  where 
applicable  will attract levy of charges as specified by the bank from time 
to time  Similarly  the bank may specify charges for issue of cheques books 
additional statement of accounts  duplicate pass book  folio charges  etc 
All such details regarding terms and conditions for operation of the 
accounts and schedule of charges for various services provided should be 
communicated to the prospective depositor while opening the account for 
the sake of transparency 
Eligibility 
A savings bank account can be opened by eligible person s  and 
certain organizations agencies  as advised by the RBI from time to time 
But current accounts can be opened by individuals  partnership firms 
private and public limited companies  Hindu Undivided Families  HUFs 
specified associates  society trusts  etc  Eligibility criteria for a savings 
account and a current account are largely similar  but there are important 
differences too  While both the accounts can be opened by individuals  the 
savings account cannot be opened by a firm  Term Deposit Accounts can 
be opened by all categories of account holders 
Requirement of PAN 
In addition to the due diligence requirements  under KYC norms 
banks are required by law to obtain a Permanent Account Number  PAN 
from the prospective account holder or alternate declarations as specified 
under the Income Tax Act 
 Notes 
Operation of Joint Account 
Deposit accounts can be opened by an individual in his own name 
or by more than one individual in their own names  known as a  joint 
account A joint account can be operated by a single individual or by more 
than one individual jointly  The mandate for who can operate the account 
can be modified with the consent of all accountholders  Joint accounts 
opened by minors with their parents or guardians can be only operated 
by the latter  Accountholders of a joint account can give mandates on the 
operation of the account  and the disposal of balances in the event of the 
demise of one or more of the holders  Banks classify these mandates as 
 Either or Survivor  and  Any one or Survivor s  etc 
Power of Attorney 
At the request of the depositor  the bank can register mandate 
power of attorney given by him authorizing another person to operate the 
account on his behalf 
Closure Renewal of Deposits 
Term-deposit account holders at the time of placing their deposits 
can give instructions with regard to closure of deposit account or renewal 
of deposit for further period on the date of maturity  In absence of such 
mandate  the bank will usually seek instructions from the depositor s  as 
to the renewal of the deposit or otherwise by sending intimation before 
say    days of the maturity date of the term deposit  If no mandate is given 
or received by the bank before the date of maturity of term deposit  the 
bank will be at liberty to roll over the deposit on due date 
Nomination 
A depositor is permitted to officially authorize someone  who would 
receive the money of his account when the depositor passes away  This is 
called the nomination process  Nomination facility is available on all de- 
posit accounts opened by individuals  Nomination is also available to a sole 
proprietary concern account  Nomination can be made in favour of one in- 
dividual only  Nomination so made can be cancelled or changed by the ac- 
count holder s anytime  Nomination can be made in favour of a minor too 
 Notes 
Deposit Related Services 
As per the RBI guidelines  banks are required to provide some 
services to the depositors and to recognize the rights of depositors  The 
ultimate objective of the banking industry should be to provide a customer 
different services they are rightfully entitled to receive without demand 
Following are the deposit related services provided by banks 
Customer Information 
Customer information collected from the customers should not be 
used for cross-selling of services or products by the bank  its subsidiaries 
and affiliates  If the bank proposes to use such information  it should be 
strictly with the  express consent  of the account-holder 
Banks are not expected to disclose details particulars of the 
customer s account to a third person or party without the expressed or 
implied consent from the customer  However  there are some exceptions 
such as disclosure of information under compulsion of law or where there 
is a duty to public for the bank to disclose 
Interest Payment 
Interest is paid on savings bank deposit account at the rate specified 
by RBI from time to time  In case of savings bank accounts  till recently 
banks paid interest on the minimum balance between the  th and the last 
day of the month  With effect from April     banks have been advised 
to calculate interest on savings bank deposit by considering daily product 
which would benefit the holders of savings bank accounts 
Term-deposit interest rates are decided by individual banks with in 
these general guidelines  In terms of RBI directives  interest is calculated 
at quarterly intervals on term deposits and paid at the rate decided by 
the bank depending upon the period of deposits  The interest on term 
deposits is calculated by the bank in accordance with the formulae and 
conventions advised by Indian Bank Association 
 Notes 
Tax Deducted at Source  TDS 
The bank has statutory obligation to deduct tax at source if the 
total interest paid payable on all term deposits held by a person exceeds 
the amount specified under the Income Tax Act and rules there under 
The Bank will issue a tax deduction certificate  TDS Certificate  for the 
amount of tax deducted  The depositor  if entitled to exemption from 
TDS  can submit a declaration to the bank in the prescribed format at the 
beginning of every financial year 
Premature Withdrawal of Term Deposit 
The bank on request from the depositor  at its discretion  may allow 
withdrawal of term-deposit before completion of the period of the deposit 
agreed upon at the time of placing the deposit  Banks usually charge a 
penalty for premature withdrawal of deposits  The bank shall declare their 
penal interest rates policy for premature withdrawal of term deposit  if 
any  at the time of opening of the account 
Premature Renewal of Term Deposit 
In case the depositor desires to renew the deposit by seeking 
premature closure of an existing term deposit account  the bank will 
permit the renewal at the applicable rate on the date of renewal  provided 
the deposit is renewed for a period longer than the balance period of the 
original deposit  While prematurely closing a deposit for the purpose of 
renewal  interest on the deposit for the period it has remained with the 
bank will be paid at the rate applicable to the period for which the deposit 
remained with the bank and not at the contracted rate 
Advances Against Deposit 
The Bank may consider requests of the depositor s  for loan 
overdraft facility against term deposits duly discharged by the depositor s 
on execution of necessary security documents  The bank may also consider 
giving an advance against a deposit standing in the name of minor 
However  a suitable declaration stating that the loan is for the benefit of 
the minor  is to be furnished by the depositor-applicant 
 Notes 
Settlement of Dues in Deceased Deposit Account 
a   
If the depositor has registered nomination with the bank  the 
balance outstanding in the account of the deceased depositor will 
be transferred  paid to the nominee after the bank is satisfied about 
the identity of the nominee  etc 
b  The above procedure will be followed even in respect of a joint 
account where nomination is registered with the bank 
c  In case of joint deposit accounts where joint account holders do 
not give any mandate for disposal  when one of the joint account 
holders dies  the bank is required to make payment jointly to the 
legal heirs of the deceased person and the surviving depositor s 
In these cases  delays may ensue in the production of legal papers 
by the heirs of the deceased  However  if the joint account holders 
had given mandate for disposal of the balance in the account in the 
forms such as  either or survivor   former latter or survivor   anyone 
of survivors or survivor  etc  the payment will be made as per the 
mandate  In such cases  there is no delay in production of legal 
papers by the heirs of the deceased 
d  In the absence of nomination  the bank will pay the amount 
outstanding to all legal heirs against joint application and on receipt 
of the necessary documents  including court order 
Stop Payment Facility 
The Bank will accept  stop payment  instructions from the 
depositors in respect of cheques issued by them  Charges  as specified  will 
be recovered 
Dormant Accounts 
Accounts which are not operated for a considerable period of time 
 usually   months for savings bank accounts and   months for 
current accounts  will be transferred to a separate dormant inoperative 
account status in the interest of the depositor as well as the bank  The 
depositor will be informed if there are charges that the bank would levy 
on dormant inoperative accounts  Such accounts can be used again on an 
activation request to the bank  Such a practice is in the interest of the 
 Notes 
depositor since it avoids the possibility of frauds on the account  It is also 
in the interest of the bank as it reduces the servicing costs that the bank 
would have had to incur if the account were to remain active 
Safe Deposit Locker 
This facility is not offered through all bank branches and wherever 
the facility is offered  allotment of safe deposit vault will be subject to 
availability and compliance with other terms and conditions attached 
to the service  Safe deposit lockers may be hired by an individual  not a 
minor  singly or jointly with another individual s  HUFs  firms  limited 
companies  associates  societies  trusts etc  Nomination facility is available 
to individual s  holding the lockers singly or jointly  In the absence of 
nomination or mandate for disposal of contents of lockers  with a view 
to avoid hardship to common persons  the bank will release the contents 
of locker to the legal heirs against indemnity on the lines as applicable to 
deposit accounts 
Redress of Complaints and Grievance 
Depositors having any complaint grievance with regard to services 
rendered by the bank have a right to approach the authorities designated 
by the bank for handling customer complaints grievances  In case the 
depositor does not get a response from the bank within one month after the 
bank receives his representation  complaint or he is not satisfied with the 
response received from the bank  he has a right to approach the Banking 
Ombudsman appointed by RBI 
Deposit Services Offered to Non-Resident Indians 
Banks actively seek banking business from Non-Resident Indians 
 NRIs  by offering different types of deposit accounts  and related services 
in accordance with RBI guidelines  including 
     
Non-resident ordinary account 
     
Non-resident  external  Rupee account  and 
     
Foreign currency non-resident account  Banks 
 Notes 
Definition of Non-Resident Indian  NRI 
As per the Foreign Exchange Management Act  FEMA    an 
NRI means  on-Resident Indian National  i e  Non-resident Indian holding 
Indian passport  and Persons of Indian Origin  i e  Non-residents holding 
foreign passports 
Non-Resident Indian Nationals Include 
 i 
Indian citizens who proceed abroad for employment or for any 
business or vocation in circumstances indicating an indefinite 
period of stay outside India  NRI is defined differently under 
different acts  For the purpose of bank accounts  FEMA definition 
holds 
 ii  Indian citizens working abroad on assignments with foreign 
governments  international multinational agencies such as the 
United Nations  the International Monetary Fund  the World Bank 
etc 
 iii  Officials of Central and State Governments and Public Sector 
Undertakings  PSUs  deputed abroad on assignments with foreign 
governments  multilateral agencies or Indian diplomatic missions 
abroad 
PIO  Persons of Indian Origin  is defined as a citizen of any country 
other than Bangladesh or Pakistan  if 
     
He has at any time held an Indian passport  or 
     
He or either of his parents or any of his grandparents was a citizen 
of India  or 
     
The person is a spouse of an Indian citizen or a person referred to 
in sub-clause  a  or  b 
In general  NRI is thus a person of Indian nationality or origin 
who is resident abroad for business or employment or vocation  or with 
the intension of seeking employment or vocation and the period of stay 
abroad is uncertain 
 Notes 
Non Resident Ordinary Accounts  NRO 
These are Rupee accounts and can be opened by any person 
resident outside India  Typically  when a resident becomes non-resident 
his domestic Rupee account gets converted into an NRO account  In 
other words  it is basically a domestic account of an NRI which help him 
get credits which accrue in India  such as rent from property or income 
from other investments  New accounts can be opened by sending fresh 
remittances from abroad  NRO accounts can be opened only as savings 
account  current account  recurring deposits and term-deposit accounts 
Regulations on interest rates  tenors etc  are similar to those of domestic 
accounts  While the principal of NRO deposits is non-repatriable  current 
income such as interest earnings on NRO deposits are repatriable  Further 
NRI PIO may remit an amount  not exceeding US millionper financial 
year  for permissible transactions from these accounts 
Non-Resident  External  Rupee Account 
The Non-Resident  External  Rupee Account NR E RA scheme 
also known as the NRE scheme  was introduced in   This is a rupee 
account  Any NRI can open an NRE account with funds remitted to India 
through a bank abroad 
An NRE rupee account may be opened as current  savings  and 
recurring or term deposit account  Since this account is maintained in 
Rupees  the depositor is exposed to exchange risk  Thus  a student going 
abroad for studies or a tourist going abroad for brief visit is not an NRI 
This is a repatriable account  for both interest and principal  and transfer 
from to another NRE account or FCNR  B  account  see below  is also 
permitted  Local payments can also be freely made from NRE accounts 
NRIs   PIOs have the option to credit the current income to their NRE 
accounts  provided income tax has been deducted   provided for  Interest 
rates on NRE accounts are determined by the RBI  for both savings and 
term deposits 
Foreign Currency Non Resident Account  Banks 
The Foreign Currency Non-Resident Account  Banks  or FCNR B 
accounts scheme was introduced with effect from May     to replace 
the then prevailing FCNR A  scheme introduced in  
 Notes 
     
These are foreign currency accounts  which can be opened by NRIs 
in only designated currencies  Pound Sterling  US Dollar  Canadian 
Dollar  Australian Dollar  EURO and Japanese Yen 
     
Repatriation of principal amount and interest is permitted 
     
These deposits can be opened only in the form of term deposits 
     
Deposits are in foreign currency and are repaid in the currency of 
issue  Hence  there is no exchange risk for the account holder 
     
Transfer of funds from existing NRE accounts to FCNR  B  accounts 
and vice- versa  of the same account holder  is permissible without 
the prior approval of RBI 
A bank should obtain the prior approval of its Board of Directors 
for the interest rates that it will offer on deposits of various maturities 
within the ceiling prescribed by RBI 
Deposit Insurance 
Deposit insurance helps sustain public confidence in the banking 
system through the protection of depositors  especially small depositors 
against loss of deposit to a significant extent  In India  bank deposits are 
covered under the insurance scheme offered by Deposit Insurance and 
Credit Guarantee Corporation of India  DICGC  which was established 
with funding from the Reserve Bank of India  The scheme is subject to 
certain limits and conditions  DICGC is a wholly-owned subsidiary 
of the RBI  All commercial banks including branches of foreign banks 
functioning in India  local area banks and regional rural banks are insured 
by the DICGC  Further  all State  Central and Primary cooperative banks 
functioning in States Union Territories which have amended the local 
Cooperative Societies Act empowering RBI suitably are insured by the 
DICGC  Primary cooperative societies are not insured by the DICGC 
In the event of a bank failure  DICGC protects bank deposits that 
are payable in India  DICGC is liable to pay if A bank goes into liquidation 
If a bank is amalgamated  merged with another bank  There are two 
methods of protecting depositors  interest when an insured bank fails 
 i   
By transferring business of the failed bank to another sound bank 
 in case of merger or amalgamation  and 
 Notes 
 ii   
Where the DICGC pays insurance proceeds to depositors 
 insurance pay-out method Each depositor in a bank is insured up 
to a maximum of   for both principal and interest amount 
held by him in the same capacity and same right  Deposit insurance 
premium is borne entirely by the insured bank  Banks are required 
to pay the insurance premium for the eligible amount to the DICGC 
on a semi-annual basis  The cost of the insurance premium cannot 
be passed on to the customer  The deposit insurance scheme is 
compulsory and no bank can withdraw from it  The DICGC  on 
the other hand  can withdraw the deposit insurance cover for a 
bank if it fails to pay the premium for three consecutive half year 
periods  In the event of the DICGC withdrawing its cover from 
any bank for default in the payment of premium  the public will be 
notified through the newspapers 
Loans and Advances 
Banks extend credit to different categories of borrowers for a wide 
variety of purposes  For many borrowers  bank credit is the easiest to 
access at reasonable interest rates  Bank credit is provided to households 
retail traders  small and medium enterprises  SMEs  corporate  the 
Government undertakings etc  in the economy  Retail banking loans are 
accessed by consumers of goods and services for financing the purchase 
of consumer durables  housing or even for day-to-day consumption  In 
contrast  the need for capital investment  and day-to-day operations of 
private corporate and the Government undertakings are met through 
wholesale lending  Loans for capital expenditure are usually extended with 
medium and long-term maturities  while day-to-day finance requirements 
are provided through short-term credit  working capital loans  Meeting 
the financing needs of the agriculture sector is also an important role that 
Indian banks play 
Principles of Lending 
To lend  banks depend largely on deposits from the public  Banks 
act as custodian of public deposits  Since the depositors require safety 
and security of their deposits  want to withdraw deposits whenever they 
need and also adequate return  bank lending must necessarily be based on 
principles that reflect these concerns of the depositors  These principles 
include  safety  liquidity  profitability  and risk diversion 
 Notes 
Safety 
Banks need to ensure that advances are safe and money lent out 
by them will come back  Since the repayment of loans depends on the 
borrowers  capacity to pay  the banker must be satisfied before lending that 
the business for which money is sought is a sound one  In addition  bankers 
many times insist on security against the loan  which they fall back on if 
things go wrong for the business  The security must be adequate  readily 
marketable and free of encumbrances 
Liquidity 
To maintain liquidity  banks have to ensure that money lent out 
by them is not locked up for long time by designing the loan maturity 
period appropriately  Further  money must comeback as per the repayment 
schedule  If loans become excessively illiquid  it may not be possible for 
bankers to meet their obligations vis- -vis depositors 
Profitability 
To remain viable  a bank must earn adequate profit on its investment 
This calls for adequate margin between deposit rates and lending rates 
In this respect  appropriate fixing of interest rates on both advances 
and deposits is critical  Unless interest rates are competitively fixed and 
margins are adequate  banks may lose customers to their competitors and 
become unprofitable 
Risk Diversification 
To mitigate risk  banks should lend to a diversified customer 
base  Diversification should be in terms of geographic location  nature of 
business etc  If  for example  all the borrowers of a bank are concentrated 
in one region and that region gets affected by a natural disaster  the bank s 
profitability can be seriously affected 
Loan Policy 
Based on the general principles of lending stated above  the Credit 
Policy Committee  CPC  of individual banks prepares the basic credit policy 
 Notes 
of the Bank  which has to be approved by the Bank s Board of Directors 
The loan policy outlines lending guidelines and establishes operating 
procedures in all aspects of credit management including standards for 
presentation of credit proposals  financial covenants  rating standards 
and benchmarks  delegation of credit approving powers  prudential limits 
on large credit exposures  asset concentrations  portfolio management 
loan review mechanism  risk monitoring and evaluation  pricing of loans 
provisioning for bad debts  regulatory  legal compliance etc  The lending 
guidelines reflect the specific bank s lending strategy  both at the macro 
level and individual borrower level  and have to be in conformity with RBI 
guidelines  The loan policy typically lays down lending guidelines in the 
following areas such as level of credit-deposit ratio  targeted portfolio mix 
hurdle ratings  loan pricing  collateral security 
Credit Deposit  CD  Ratio 
A bank can lend out only a certain proportion of its deposits  since 
some part of deposits have to be statutorily maintained as Cash Reserve 
Ratio  CRR  deposits  and an additional part has to be used for making 
investment in prescribed securities  Statutory Liquidity Ratio or SLR 
requirement  It may be noted that these are minimum requirements 
Banks have the option of having more cash reserves than CRR requirement 
and invest more in SLR securities than they are required to  Further  banks 
also have the option to invest in non-SLR securities  Therefore  the CPC 
has to lay down the quantum of credit that can be granted by the bank 
as a percentage of deposits available  Currently  the average CD ratio of 
the entire banking industry is around   percent  though it differs across 
banks  It is rarely observed that banks lend out of their borrowings 
Targeted Portfolio Mix 
The CPC aims at a targeted portfolio mix keeping in view both 
risk and return  Toward this end  it lays down guidelines on choosing the 
preferred areas of lending  such as sunrise sectors and profitable sectors 
as well as the sectors to avoid  Banks typically monitor all major sectors of 
the economy  They target a portfolio mix in the light of forecasts for growth 
and profitability for each sector  If a bank perceives economic weakness in 
a sector  it would restrict new exposures to that segment and similarly 
growing and profitable sectors of the economy prompt banks to increase 
 Notes 
new exposures to those sectors  This entails active portfolio management 
Further  the bank also has to decide which sectors to avoid 
Hurdle Ratings 
There are a number of diverse risk factors associated with 
borrowers  Banks should have a comprehensive risk rating system that 
serves as a single point indicator of diverse risk factors of a borrower 
This helps taking credit decisions in a consistent manner  To facilitate 
this  a substantial degree of standardization is required in ratings across 
borrowers  The risk rating system should be so designed as to reveal the 
overall risk of lending  For new borrowers  a bank usually lays down 
guidelines regarding minimum rating to be achieved by the borrower 
to become eligible for the loan  This is also known as the  hurdle rating 
criterion to be achieved by a new borrower 
Pricing of Loans 
Risk-return trade-off is a fundamental aspect of risk management 
Borrowers with weak financial position and  hence  placed in higher risk 
category are provided credit facilities at a higher price  that is  at higher 
interest  The higher the credit risk of a borrower the higher would be his 
cost of borrowing  To price credit risks  banks devise appropriate systems 
which usually allow flexibility for revising the price  risk premium  due 
to changes in rating  In other words  if the risk rating of a borrower 
deteriorates  his cost of borrowing should rise and vice versa  At the 
macro level  loan pricing for a bank is dependent upon a number of its 
cost factors such as cost of raising resources  cost of administration and 
overheads  cost of reserve assets like CRR and SLR  cost of maintaining 
capital  percentage of bad debt  etc  Loan pricing is also dependent upon 
competition 
Collateral Security 
As part of a prudent lending policy  banks usually advance loans 
against some security  The loan policy provides guidelines for this  In 
the case of term loans and working capital assets  banks take as  primary 
security  the property or goods against which loans are granted  In addition 
to this  banks often ask for additional security or  collateral security  in the 
 Notes 
form of both physical and financial assets to further bind the borrower 
This reduces the risk for the bank  Sometimes  loans are extended as  clean 
loans  for which only personal guarantee of the borrower is taken 
Compliance with RBI Guidelines 
The credit policy of a bank should be conformant with RBI 
guidelines  some of the important guidelines of the RBI relating to bank 
credit are discussed below 
Directed Credit Stipulation 
The RBI lays down guidelines regarding minimum advances to 
be made for priority sector advances  export credit finance  etc  These 
guidelines need to be kept in mind while formulating credit policies for 
the Bank 
Capital Adequacy 
If a bank creates assets-loans or investment-they are required to be 
backed up by bank capital  the amount of capital they have to be backed 
up by depends on the risk of individual assets that the bank acquires  The 
riskier the asset  the larger would be the capital it has to be backed up by 
This is so  because bank capital provides a cushion against unexpected 
losses of banks and riskier assets would require larger amounts of capital 
to act as cushion  The Basel Committee for Bank Supervision  BCBS  has 
prescribed a set of norms for the capital requirement for the banks for all 
countries to follow  These norms ensure that capital should be adequate 
to absorb unexpected losses  In addition  all countries  including India 
establish their own guidelines for risk based capital framework known as 
Capital Adequacy Norms 
These norms have to be at least as stringent as the norms set by 
the Basel committee  A key norm of the Basel committee is the Capital 
Adequacy Ratio  CAR  also known as Capital Risk Weighted Assets 
Ratio  is a simple measure of the soundness of a bank  The ratio is the 
capital with the bank as a percentage of its risk-weighted assets  Given the 
level of capital available with an individual bank  this ratio determines 
the maximum extent to which the bank can lend  The Basel committee 
 Notes 
specifies a CAR of at least   the bank s risk weighted assets for banks 
In India  the RBI has specified a minimum of   which is more stringent 
than the international norm  In fact  the actual ratio of all scheduled 
commercial banks  SCBs  in India stood at   in March  The RBI 
also provides guidelines about how much risk weights banks should assign 
to different classes of assets  such as loans 
Credit Exposure Limits 
As a prudential measure aimed at better risk management and 
avoidance of concentration of credit risks  the Reserve Bank has fixed 
limits on bank exposure to the capital market as well as to individual and 
group borrowers with reference to a bank s capital  Limits on inter-bank 
exposures have also been placed  Banks are further encouraged to place 
internal caps on their sectoral exposures  their exposure to commercial 
real estate and to unsecured exposures 
These exposures are closely monitored by the Reserve Bank 
Prudential norms on banks  exposures to NBFCs and to related entities are 
also in place  RBI has given guidelines on exposure norms for commercial 
banks in India  Further  a Bank may fix its own credit exposure limits 
for mitigating credit risk  The bank may  for example  set upper caps on 
exposures to sensitive sectors like commodity sector  real estate sector and 
capital markets  Banks also may lay down guidelines regarding exposure 
limits to unsecured loans 
Lending Rates 
Banks are free to determine their own lending rates on all kinds 
of advances except a few such as export finance  interest rates on these 
exceptional categories of advances are regulated by the RBI  It may be noted 
that the Section  A of the BR Act provides that the rate of interest charged 
by a bank shall not be reopened by any court on the ground that the rate of 
interest charged is excessive  The concept of benchmark prime lending rate 
 BPLR  was however introduced in November   for pricing of loans 
by commercial banks with the objective of enhancing transparency in 
the pricing of their loan products  Each bank must declare its benchmark 
prime lending rate  BPLR  as approved by its Board of Directors  A bank s 
BPLR is the interest rate to be charged to its best clients  that is  clients with 
 Notes 
the lowest credit risk  Each bank is also required to indicate the maximum 
spread over the BPLR for various credit exposures  However  BPLR lost 
its relevance over time as a meaningful reference rate  as the bulk of loans 
were advanced below BPLR  According to RBI guidelines  the  Base Rate 
system  will replace the BPLR system with effect from July    All 
categories of loans should henceforth be priced only with reference to the 
Base Rate  Each bank will decide its own Base Rate 
The actual lending rates charged to borrowers would be the 
Base Rate plus borrower-specific charges  which will include product- 
specific operating costs  credit risk premium and tenor premium  Since 
transparency in the pricing of loans is a key objective  banks are required 
to exhibit the information on their Base Rate at all branches and also on 
their websites  Changes in the Base Rate should also be conveyed to the 
general public from time to time through appropriate channels  Apart from 
transparency  banks should ensure that interest rates charged to customers 
in the above arrangement are non-discriminatory in nature 
Guidelines on Fair Practices Code for Lender 
RBI has been encouraging banks to introduce a fair practices code 
for bank loans  Loan application forms in respect of all categories of loans 
irrespective of the amount of loan sought by the borrower should be 
comprehensive  It should include information about the fees  charges  if 
any  payable for processing the loan  the amount of such fees refundable 
in the case of non-acceptance of application  prepayment options and any 
other matter which affects the interest f the borrower  so that a meaningful 
comparison with the fees charged by other banks can be made and 
informed decision can be taken by the borrower  Further  the banks must 
inform  all-in-cost  to the customer to enable him to compare the rates 
charged with other sources of finance 
Regulations Relating to Providing Loans 
The provisions of the Banking Regulation Act     BR Act  govern 
the making of loans by banks in India  RBI issues directions covering the 
loan activities of banks  Some of the major guidelines of RBI  which are 
now in effect  are as follows 
 Notes 
Advances Against Banks Own Shares 
A bank cannot grant any loans and advances against the security of 
its own shares 
Advances to Bank s Directors 
The BR Act lays down the restrictions on loans and advances to the 
directors and the firms in which they hold substantial interest 
Restrictions on Holding Shares in Companies 
In terms of Section   of the BR Act  banks should not hold 
shares in any company except as provided in sub-section   whether as 
pledge  mortgagee or absolute owner  of an amount exceeding  of the 
paid-up share capital of that company or   of its own paid-up share 
capital and reserves  whichever is less 
Basics of Loan Appraisal  Credit Decision-Making and Review 
Credit Approval Authorities 
The Bank s Board of Directors also has to approve the delegation 
structure of the various credit approval authorities  Banks establish multi- 
tier credit approval authorities for corporate banking activities  small 
enterprises  retail credit  agricultural credit  etc 
Concurrently  each bank should set up a Credit Risk Management 
Department  CMRD  being independent of the CPC  The CRMD should 
enforce and monitor compliance of the risk parameters and prudential 
limits set up by the CPC 
Credit Appraisal and Credit Decision-Making 
When a loan proposal comes to the bank  the banker has to decide 
how much funds the proposal really requires for it to be a viable project and 
what are the credentials of those who are seeking the project  In checking 
the credentials of the potential borrowers  Credit Information Bureaus 
play an important role  Credit information bureaus are thus repositories 
 Notes 
of information  which contains the credit history of commercial and 
individual borrowers  They provide this information to their Members in 
the form of credit information reports  To get a complete picture of the 
payment history of a credit applicant  credit grantors must be able to gain 
access to the applicant s complete credit record that may be spread over 
different institutions  Credit information bureaus collect commercial and 
consumer credit-related data and collate such data to create credit reports 
which they distribute to their Members  A Credit Information Report 
 CIR  is a factual record of a borrower s credit payment history compiled 
from information received from different credit grantors  Its purpose is 
to help credit grantors make informed lending decisions - quickly and 
objectively  As of today  bureaus provide history of credit card holders and 
SMEs 
Monitoring and Review of Loan Portfolio 
It is not only important for banks to follow due processes at the time 
of sanctioning and disbursing loans  it is equally important to monitor 
the loan portfolio on a continuous basis  Banks need to constantly keep a 
check on the overall quality of the portfolio  They have to ensure that the 
borrower utilizes the funds for the purpose for which it is sanctioned and 
complies with the terms and conditions of sanction  Further  they monitor 
individual borrows accounts and check to see whether borrowers in 
different industrial sectors are facing difficulty in making loan repayment 
Information technology has become an important tool for efficient 
handling of the above functions including decision support systems and 
data bases 
Such a surveillance and monitoring approach helps to mitigate 
credit risk of the portfolio  Banks have set up Loan Review Departments 
or Credit Audit Departments in order to ensure compliance with extant 
sanction and post-sanction processes and procedures laid down by the 
Bank from time to time  This is especially applicable for the larger advances 
The Loan Review Department helps a bank to improve the quality of the 
credit portfolio by detecting early warning signals  suggesting remedial 
measures and providing the top management with information on credit 
administration  including the credit sanction process  risk evaluation and 
post-sanction follow up 
 Notes 
Types of Loans  Advances 
Advances can be broadly classified into  fund-based lending 
and non-fund based lending  Fund based lending  This is a direct form 
of lending in which a loan with an actual cash outflow is given to the 
borrower by the Bank  In most cases  such a loan is backed by primary 
and or collateral security  The loan can be to provide for financing capital 
goods and or working capital requirements  Let us discuss some important 
types of fund-based lending 
Working Capital Finance 
Working capital finance is utilized for operating purposes  resulting 
in creation of current assets  such as inventories and receivables  This is 
in contrast to term loans which are utilized for establishing or expanding 
a manufacturing unit by the acquisition of fixed assets  Banks carry out a 
detailed analysis of borrowers  working capital requirements  Credit limits 
are established in accordance with the process approved by the board of 
directors  The limits on Working capital facilities are primarily secured 
by inventories and receivables  chargeable current assets Working capital 
finance consists mainly of cash credit facilities  short term loan and bill 
discounting  Under the cash credit facility  a line of credit is provided up 
to a pre-established amount based on the borrower s projected level of 
sales inventories  receivables and cash deficits  Up to this pre-established 
amount  disbursements are made based on the actual level of inventories 
and receivables  Here the borrower is expected to buy inventory on 
payments and  thereafter  seek reimbursement from the Bank  In reality 
this may not happen  The facility is generally given for a period of up to  
months and is extended after a review of the credit limit 
Project Finance 
Project finance business consists mainly of extending medium-term 
and long-term rupee and foreign currency loans to the manufacturing and 
infrastructure sectors  Banks also provide financing by way of investment 
in marketable instruments such as fixed rate and floating rate debentures 
Lending banks usually insist on having a first charge on the fixed assets 
of the borrower  During the recent years  the larger banks are increasingly 
becoming involved in financing large projects  including infrastructure 
 Notes 
projects  Given the large amounts of financing involved  banks need to 
have a strong framework for project appraisal  The adopted framework 
will need to emphasize proper identification of projects  optimal allocation 
and mitigation of risks  The project finance approval process entails a 
detailed evaluation of technical  commercial  financial and management 
factors and the project sponsor s financial strength and experience  As part 
of the appraisal process  a risk matrix is generated  which identifies each of 
the project risks  mitigating factors and risk allocation 
Loans to Small and Medium Enterprises 
A substantial quantum of loans is granted by banks to small and 
medium enterprises  SMEs While granting credit facilities to smaller 
units  banks often use a cluster-based approach  which encourages 
financing of small enterprises that have a homogeneous profile such as 
leather manufacturing units  chemical units  or even export oriented 
units  For assessing the credit risk of individual units  banks use the credit 
scoring models  As per RBI guidelines  banks should use simplified credit 
appraisal methods for assessment of bank finance for the smaller units 
Further  banks have also been advised that they should not insist on 
collateral security for loans up to   lakh for the micro enterprises 
Rural and Agricultural Loan  The rural and agricultural loan 
portfolio of banks comprises loans to farmers  small and medium 
enterprises in rural areas  dealers and vendors linked to these entities and 
even corporate  For farmers  banks extend term loans for equipments used 
in farming  including tractors  pump sets  etc  Banks also extend crop loan 
facility to farmers  In agricultural financing  banks prefer an  area based 
approach  for example  by financing farmers in an adopted village  The 
regional rural banks  RRBs  have a special place in ensuring adequate 
credit flow to agriculture and the rural sector 
Directed Lending 
The RBI requires banks to deploy a certain minimum amount of 
their credit in certain identified sectors of the economy  This is called 
directed lending  Such directed lending comprises priority sector lending 
and export credit 
 Notes 
a  Priority sector lending  The objective of priority sector lending 
program is to ensure that adequate credit flows into some of the 
vulnerable sectors of the economy  which may not be attractive 
for the banks from the point of view of profitability  These sectors 
include agriculture  small scale enterprises  retail trade  etc  Small 
housing loans  loans to individuals for pursuing education  loans 
to weaker sections of the society etc also qualify as priority sector 
loans  To ensure banks channelize a part of their credit to these 
sectors  the RBI has set guidelines defining targets for lending to 
priority sector as whole and in certain cases  sub-targets for lend- 
ing to individual priority sectors  The RBI guidelines require banks 
to lend at least   of Adjusted Net Bank Credit  ANBC  or cred- 
it equivalent amount of Off-Balance Sheet Exposure  CEOBSE 
whichever is higher  In case of foreign banks  the target for priority 
sector advances is   of ANBC or CEOBSE  whichever is higher 
In addition to these limits for overall priority sector lending  the 
RBI sets sub-limits for certain sub-sectors within the priority sector 
such as agriculture  Banks are required to comply with the prior- 
ity sector lending requirements at the end of each financial year  A 
bank having shortfall in lending to priority sector lending target or 
sub-target shall be required to make contribution to the Rural In- 
frastructure Development Fund  RIDF  established with NABARD 
or funds with other financial institutions as specified by the RBI 
b  Export Credit  As part of directed lending  RBI requires banks to 
make loans to exporters at concessional rates of interest  Export 
credit is provided for pre-shipment and post-shipment requirements 
of exporter borrowers in rupees and foreign currencies  At the end 
of any fiscal year    of a bank s credit is required to be in the 
form of export credit  This requirement is in addition to the priority 
sector lending requirement but credits extended to exporters that 
are small scale industries or small businesses may also meet part of 
the priority sector lending requirement 
Retail Loan 
Banks  today  offer a range of retail asset products  including home 
loans  automobile loans  personal loans  for marriage  medical expenses 
etc  credit cards  consumer loans  such as TV sets  personal computers 
 Notes 
etc  and  loans against time deposits and loans against shares  Banks also 
may fund dealers who sell automobiles  two wheelers  consumer durables 
and commercial vehicles  Customers for retail loans are typically middle 
and high-income  salaried or self-employed individuals  and  in some 
cases  proprietorship and partnership firms  Except for personal loans and 
credit through credit cards  banks stipulate that 
 a   
A certain percentage of the cost of the asset  such as a home or 
a TV set  sought to be financed by the loan  to be borne by the 
borrower and 
 b   
That the loans are secured by the asset financed  In making credit 
decisions  banks draw upon reports from agencies such as the Credit 
Information Bureau  India  Limited  CIBIL  about borrowers 
Some private sector banks use direct marketing associates as well 
as their own branch network and employees for marketing retail 
credit products  However  credit approval authority lies only with 
the bank s credit officers  Two important categories of retail loans 
are home finance and personal loans 
Home Finance  Banks extend home finance loans  either directly 
or through home finance subsidiaries  Such long term housing loans are 
provided to individuals and corporations and also given as construction 
finance to builders  The loans are secured by a mortgage of the property 
financed  These loans are extended for maturities generally ranging from 
five to fifteen years and a large proportion of these loans are at floating 
rates of interest  This reduces the interest rate risk that banks assume  since 
a bank s sources of finance are generally of shorter maturity  However 
fixed rate loans may also be provided  usually with banks keeping a higher 
margin over benchmark rates in order to compensate for higher interest 
rate risk  Equated monthly installments are fixed for repayment of loans 
depending upon the income and age of the borrower s 
Personal Loans  These are often unsecured loans provided 
to customers who use these funds for various purposes such as higher 
education  medical expenses  social events and holidays  Sometimes 
collateral security in the form of physical and financial assets may be 
available for securing the personal loan  Portfolio of personal loans also 
includes micro-banking loans  which are relatively small value loans 
extended to lower income customers in urban and rural areas 
 Notes 
International Loans Extended by Banks 
Indian corporate raise foreign currency loans from banks based 
in India as well as abroad as per guidelines issued by RBI  Government 
of India  Banks raise funds abroad for on-lending to Indian corporate 
Further  banks based in India have an access to deposits placed by Non- 
Resident Indians  NRIs  in the form of FCNR  B  deposits  which can be 
used by banks in India for on-lending to Indian customers 
Non-Fund Based Lending 
In this type of facility  the Bank makes no funds outlay  However 
such arrangements may be converted to fund-based advances if the client 
fails to fulfill the terms of his contract with the counterparty  Such facilities 
are known as contingent liabilities of the bank  Facilities such as  letters of 
credit  and  guarantees  fall under the category of non-fund based credit 
Management of Non Performing Assets 
An asset of a bank  such as a loan given by the bank  turns into a 
non-performing asset  NPA  when it ceases to generate regular income 
such as interest etc for the bank  In other words  when a bank which lends 
a loan does not get back its principal and interest on time  the loan is 
said to have turned into an NPA  While NPAs are a natural fall-out of 
undertaking banking business and hence cannot be completely avoided 
high levels of NPAs can severely erode the bank s profits  its capital 
and ultimately its ability to lend further funds to potential borrowers 
Similarly  at the macro level  a high level of non-performing assets means 
choking off credit to potential borrowers  thus lowering capital formation 
and economic activity  So the challenge is to keep the growth of NPAs 
under control  Clearly  it is important to have a robust appraisal of loans 
which can reduce the chances of loan turning into an NPA  Also  once a 
loan starts facing difficulties  it is important for the bank to take remedial 
action 
According to the RBI guidelines  banks must classify their assets 
on an on-going basis into the following four categories such as standard 
assets  sub-standard assets  doubtful assets and loss assets 
 Notes 
Once a borrower faces difficulty in repaying loans or paying 
interest  the bank should initially address the problem by trying to verify 
whether the financed company is viable in the long run  If the company 
project is viable  then rehabilitation is possible by restructuring the credit 
facilities  In a restructuring exercise  the bank can change the repayment 
or interest payment schedule to improve the chances of recovery or even 
make some sacrifices in terms of waiving interest etc RBI has separate 
guidelines for restructured loans  To create an institutional mechanism 
for the restructuring of corporate debt  RBI has devised a Corporate Debt 
Restructuring  CDR  system  The objective of this framework is to ensure 
a timely and transparent mechanism for the restructuring of corporate 
debts of viable entities facing problems 
Banks utilize the Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial 
Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act     SARFAESI  as an 
effective tool for NPA recovery  It is possible where non-performing assets 
are backed by securities charged to the Bank by way of hypothecation or 
mortgage or assignment  Upon loan default  banks can seize the securities 
 except agricultural land  without intervention of the court  SARFAESI 
is effective only for secured loans where bank can enforce the underlying 
security e g  hypothecation  pledge and mortgages  In such cases  court 
intervention is not necessary  unless the security is invalid or fraudulent 
However  if the asset in question is an unsecured asset  the bank would 
have to move the court to file civil case against the defaulters 
The SARFAESI Act    gives powers of  seize and desist  to 
banks  Banks can give a notice in writing to the defaulting borrower 
requiring it to discharge its liabilities within   days  If the borrower fails 
to comply with the notice  the Bank may take recourse to one or more of 
the following measures  Take possession of the security for the loan  Sale 
or lease or assign the right over the security  and manage the same or 
appoint any person to manage the same  The SARFAESI Act also provides 
for the establishment of asset reconstruction companies regulated by RBI 
to acquire assets from banks and financial institutions  The Act provides 
for sale of financial assets by banks and financial institutions to asset 
reconstruction companies  ARCs  RBI has issued guidelines to banks on 
the process to be followed for sales of financial assets to ARCs 
 Notes 
Balance Sheet of a Bank 
Banks are a key intermediary in the financial sector  Being 
companies  they are covered by the Companies Act    The Act 
through Schedule VI has specified a format for financial statements of 
companies  The Accounting Standards Board of the Institute of Chartered 
Accountants of India  ICAI  formulates accounting standards  with a 
view to harmonize the accounting policies and practices  The Schedule 
VI was revised by Ministry of Corporate Affairs on March     The 
revised Schedule VI has been framed as per the existing non-converged 
Indian Accounting Standards notified under the Companies  Accounting 
Standards  Rules    and has no connection with the converged Indian 
Accounting Standards  Important changes in the revised Schedule VI 
include 
a   
Only vertical form is allowed 
b   
Unit of measurement should be uniform 
c   
 sources of funds  has been replaced with  Equity   Liabilities 
Liabilities will be classified as current and non-current liabilities 
Schedules are eliminated and additional information are to be 
provided in the Notes to Accounts 
RBI  on its part  wishes to align Indian banking system with global 
standards  Further  since banking companies are different from normal 
manufacturing companies  direct application of the ICAI standards to 
banking companies created issues  With a view to eliminating gaps in 
compliance with accounting standards by banks  a Working Group was 
created  The recommendations of the Working Group were accepted by 
RBI  Accordingly  RBI has issued guidelines to be followed by banks 
Balance Sheet of a Bank 
Balance sheet of a bank brings out its financial operations for that 
particular period and one can find out the extent of operating profits 
earned by a bank compared to its previous year  In addition to this  the 
balance sheet also depicts the financial soundness of the bank  This can be 
found from the funds that are owned and borrowed by the bank and the 
way they are developed 
 Notes 
The liability side of the balance sheet has owned funds in the form 
of capital and reserves  followed by borrowed funds  consisting of deposits 
and other borrowings  The asset side of the balance sheet is on the basis of 
descending order of liquidity and ascending order of profitability  That is 
cash being highly liquid asset  finds its first place followed by money at 
call and short notice  investments and advances  From the point of view 
of profitability  we find that cash comes as the last item on the ascending 
order as cash on hand does not bring any return to the bank 
The following summarized balance sheet of a bank gives an idea of 
the nature of items that feature in a bank s balance sheet

Now  let us analyze the items of balance sheet 
Capital and Liabilities 
Capital  Every bank will have an authorized capital  This is the 
maximum capital that a bank is allowed to raise by issue of shares  In the 
case of public sector banks  this may be completely contributed by the 
 Notes 
government  But in the case of private sector banks  different types of 
shareholders contribute this  As per the Banking Regulation Act  issued 
capital should not be less than   of authorized capital and the subscribed 
capital should not be less than   of the issued capital 
Paid up capital should not be less than   of subscribed capital 
This shows that from the authorized capital  a bank should issue shares with 
a minimum of not less than   which is called issued capital  Subscribed 
capital is that which the public have agreed to subscribe and this should 
not be less than   of the issued capital  Paid up capital is what actually 
paid by the shareholders which should not be less than   of subscribed 
capital  For example  if an amount of     crores is authorized capital     
crores will be issued capital      crores  which is   of issued capital 
will be subscribed capital      crores will be the paid up capital  These 
are all the minimum requirements as per the law  it can be more than this 
also  As per the International Banking Convention  BASLE  every bank 
must have core capital  which should be minimum   of its deposits and 
another   of capital based on risk-weighted asset structure 
Reserves and Surplus  As per Section   of the Banking Regulation 
Act  every bank must compulsorily allocate   of its profit towards 
reserve fund  A bank cannot declare any dividend until it has built-up 
reserve fund  equivalent to its paid-up capital  Hence  all the banks will 
allocate entire profit towards reserve fund until it become equivalent to 
 paid up capital  Surplus here represents the surplus earning left over after 
distributing dividends and other statutory provisions  Share premiums 
will also come under surplus 
Deposits  This is the biggest utility of any bank  It is based on the 
confidence created by the bank on public minds  banks mobilize deposits 
The deposits so mobilized can be broadly classified into- Demand deposit 
and Time deposit 
Borrowings  A bank borrows from RBI to meet its current 
requirements  as the interest rate charged by RBI called the Bank rate will 
be less than market rate  In addition to this  banks will also go for inter 
bank borrowings to meet the customers  obligations  There will also be 
borrowings by commercial banks from foreign banks in terms of foreign 
exchange  Thus  bank borrowings will be from within India as well as 
 Notes 
outside India  Banks also discount their first class bills when they happened 
to be Scheduled banks  In order to meet short term requirements  they 
borrow from money market  There is also money market mutual funds 
promoted by banks for the purpose of raising short-term loans 
Other Liabilities and Provisions  Bills payable will form part 
of other liabilities  Drafts  telegraphic transfers  mail transfers  electronic 
clearance etc  will form a part of this  Interest due on deposits and 
borrowings will also be included in this  Outstanding charges like rent 
conveyance  tax deducted at source  etc  will be included in this schedule 
Assets 
Cash and Balance with RBI  Every bank should maintain certain 
amount of deposits as cash on hand to meet the demands of customers 
This includes apart from domestic currency  foreign currencies also  The 
factors which decide the balance include statutory requirements  business 
conditions  banking habit of the people  well Developed Banking System 
clearing house facilities  and seasonal stringency 
Balance with banks and money at call and short notice  Next 
to cash on hand  the most liquid asset is the balance with other banks 
and money at call and short notice  Banks maintain balances with other 
commercial banks towards inter-bank loans  These loans are called Call 
loans as they can be obtained within   hours notice from other banks 
During the busy season  banks will go for inert-bank loans  as they are not 
only cheaper but also safe  A bank instead of keeping cash idle would like 
to lend to its counterparts  i e  the other banks  for some nominal interest 
Money at call and short notice represents loan given by banks to either bill 
market brokers or to stock market brokers for a very short period  These 
loans can be called back even within   hours notice  But in India  money 
at call and short notice represents inter-bank call loans 
Investment  A bank has a moral responsibility towards its 
depositors in not only providing proper interest but also safeguarding their 
interests  A bank has a commercial obligation towards its shareholders and 
has to provide them attractive dividend  As a compromise  to protect the 
interest of both-the depositors and shareholders  a bank will have to go in for 
such an investment  which will provide better returns while maintaining the 
 Notes 
safety and security of the assets at the same time  The investment policy of 
a bank consists of three basic principles of safety  liquidity and profitability 
In addition to this  national interest and statutory requirements have to be 
fulfilled also 
Advances  Loans and advances form a part of bank asset  Loans are 
different from advances  In loans  the banker will insist on security and 
based on its market value  the loan amount will be decided  The purpose 
of the loan will not be the concern of the bank  Thus  pledge  mortgage 
assignment are some of the loans granted by banks  In advances  the bank 
will give advances for a specific purpose and such an amount cannot 
be spent for any other purpose other than specified one  Examples for 
advances are working capital or fixed capital 
Fixed assets  Land  building  furniture and fittings etc  will come 
under this category  The bank will provide necessary depreciation 
Other assets  This represents non-banking assets acquired by banks 
by way of claims from the customers  The assets might have been given as 
security for loans and due to default the bank will recover the asset as a 
part of claim 
Contingent liabilities  Here  the bank will show guarantees given 
in India and outside India for loans extended to customers  There may 
also be outstanding rent  electricity  telephone charges  etc  which will be 
shown under this item 
Bills for Collection  Customers hand over to the bank  both 
domestic and foreign bills for collection  For this  the bank will charge 
service charges  With the help of its branches  these bills are collected and 
credited to the respective customers  account 
CAMELS Framework 
 CAMELS  is a framework for composite evaluation of 
banks  and financial intermediaries  in general  The acronym stands for 
 Notes 
Capital Adequacy  This is a measure of financial strength  in 
particular its ability to cushion operational and abnormal losses  It is 
calculated based on the asset structure of the bank  and the risk weights 
that have been assigned by the regulator for each asset class 
Asset Quality  This depends on factors such as concentration of 
loans in the portfolio  related party exposure and provisions made for loan 
loss 
Management  Management of the bank obviously influences the 
other parameters  Operating cost per unit of money lent and earnings per 
employee are parameters used 
Earnings  This can be measured through ratios like return on 
assets  return on equity and interest spread 
Liquidity  In order to meet obligations as they come  the bank 
needs an effective asset-liability management system that balances gaps in 
the maturity profile of assets and liabilities  However  if the bank provides 
too much liquidity  then it will suffer in terms of profitability  This can be 
measured by the Loans to Deposit ratio  separately for short term  medium 
term and long term 
Sensitivity to Market Risk  Longer the maturity of debt investments 
more prone it is to valuation losses  if interest rates go up  More sensitive 
the portfolio is to market risk  the more risky the bank is 
Assets and Liabilities Management of Bank 
Banks are always aiming at maximizing profitability at the same 
time trying to ensure sufficient liquidity to repose confidence in the minds 
of the depositors on their ability in servicing the deposits by making timely 
payment of interest returning them on due dates and meeting all other 
liability commitments as agreed upon  To achieve these objectives  it is 
essential that banks have to monitor  maintain and manage their assets 
and liabilities portfolios in a systematic manner taking into account the 
various risks involved in these areas  This concept has gained importance 
in Indian conditions in the wake of the ongoing financial sector reforms 
particularly reforms relating to interest rate deregulation  The technique 
 Notes 
of managing both assets and liabilities together has come into being as a 
strategic response of banks to inflationary pressure  volatility in interest 
rates and severe recessionary trends which marked the global economy in 
the seventies and eighties 
Assets and Liabilities Management  ALM  is a dynamic process 
of planning  organizing  coordinating and controlling the assets and 
liabilities   their mixes  volumes  maturities  yields and costs in order to 
achieve a specified Net Interest Income  NII  The NII is the difference 
between interest income and interest expenses and the basic source of 
banks profitability  The easing of controls on interest rates has led to 
higher interest rate volatility in India  Hence  there is a need to measure 
and monitor the interest rate exposure of Indian banks  ALM is a system 
of matching cash inflows and outflows  and thus of liquidity management 
The ALM system rests on three pillars  i e 
a   
ALM Information system  MIS 
b   
ALM organization  Structure and responsibilities 
c   
ALM Process  Risk parameters  identifying  measuring  managing 
risks and setting risk policies and tolerance levels 
Adopting an asset liability management philosophy is an important 
first step in drafting ALM policy  The philosophy should set out the broad 
goals and objectives of the bank s asset liability portfolio  as established by 
the board of directors  who represent the membership at large  The ALM 
philosophy should always address the following principles 
     
The bank will manage its asset cash flows in relation to its liability 
cash flows in a manner that contributes adequately to earnings and 
limits the risk to the financial margin 
     
Product terms  pricing and balance sheet mix must balance product 
demands with the need to protect the equity of the bank 
     
Financial derivatives instruments must only be used to limit interest 
rate risk and must never be used for speculative or investment 
purposes 
 Notes 
Balance Sheet Risk 
Balance sheet risk can be categorized into two major types of 
significant risks  which are liquidity risk and interest rate risk  Interest rate 
risk is the risk to earnings or capital arising from movement of interest 
rates  It arises from differences between the timing of rate changes and 
the timing of cash flows  re-pricing risk  from changing rate relationships 
among yield curves that affect bank activities  basis risk from changing 
rate relationships across the spectrum of maturities  yield curve risk and 
from interest-rate-related options embedded in bank products  option 
risk  The value of a bank s assets  liabilities  and interest-rate-related  off- 
balance-sheet contracts is affected by a change in rates because the present 
value of future cash flows  and in some cases the cash flows themselves  is 
changed  For measuring interest rate risk  banks use a variety of method 
such as gap analysis  the duration gap method  the basis point value  BPV 
method  and simulation methods 
Matching Maturities 
Policy should require that  as much as possible  liability maturities 
and cash flows correlate to asset maturities and cash flows   Matching 
refers to the process of structuring the balance sheet so that maturities of 
interest rate sensitive assets correspond closely to the maturities of interest 
rate sensitive liabilities  If the balance sheet is well-matched  a change in 
interest rates will have little or no impact on margin  because assets and 
liabilities re-price at the same time  The periodic measurement of interest 
rate risk exposure will quantify the extent of balance sheet mismatch 
Balance sheet mismatches can be corrected through the use of traditional 
portfolio manipulation techniques  Alternatively  financial derivative 
instruments can be put into place to hedge against cash flow mismatches 
Conclusion 
The commercial banks have emerged as one of the major financial 
intermediaries in the country to mobilize the community s financial 
savings  Sustained efforts have been made by commercial banks to induce 
people to keep a part of their savings as bank deposits  Deposits mobilized 
by the banks are utilized for 
 Notes 
 i 
Loans and advances 
 ii  Investments in government and other approved securities in 
fulfillment of the liquidity stipulations 
 iii  Investment in commercial papers  shares  debentures  etc  up to a 
stipulated ceiling  Reserve Bank of India has instructed the banks 
to adopt the realized system of accounting and not the accrued 
system  It means that when a loan is sanctioned  it has to be repaid 
in time along with interest  In case of failure  it becomes a non 
performing asset  NPA  and the bank will have to make provisions 
from out of its profit for such NPAs  Since the balance sheet is based 
on realized system  banks cannot resort to window dressing of their 
balance sheet  Thus  we find that the new format of balance sheet 
has changed the attitude of banks towards their asset portfolio

Introduction 
A negotiable instrument is used as a medium of payment in all 
business transactions  The Negotiable Instruments Act was enacted  in 
India  in  Prior to its enactment  the provision of the English Negotiable 
Instrument Act were applicable in India  and the present Act is also based 
on the English Act with certain modifications  It extends to the whole of 
India except the State of Jammu and Kashmir  The Act operates subject 
to the provisions of Sections   and   of the Reserve Bank of India Act 
 Section   of the Reserve Bank of India Act provides that no person 
in India other than the Bank or as expressly authorized by this Act  the 
Central Government shall draw  accept  make or issue any bill of exchange 
hundi  promissory note or engagement for the payment of money payable 
to bearer on demand  This Section further provides that no one except 
the RBI or the Central Government can make or issue a promissory note 
expressed to be payable or demand or after a certain time  Section   of 
the Reserve Bank of India Act makes issue of such bills or notes punishable 
with fine which may extend to the amount of the instrument  The effect or 
the consequences of these provisions are 
a  A promissory note cannot be made payable to the bearer  no matter 
whether it is payable on demand or after a certain time 
b  A bill of exchange cannot be made payable to the bearer on demand 
though it can be made payable to the bearer after a certain time 
 Notes 
c  But a cheque  though a bill of exchange  payable to bearer or 
demand can be drawn on a person s account with a banker 
Meaning of Negotiable Instruments 
According to Section    a  of the Act   Negotiable instrument 
means a promissory note  bill of exchange or cheque payable either to 
order or to bearer  whether the word  order  or   bearer  appear on the 
instrument or not In the words of Justice  Willis   A negotiable instrument 
is one  the property in which is acquired by anyone who takes it bona 
fide and for value notwithstanding any defects of the title in the person 
from whom he took it  Thus  the term  negotiable instrument means a 
written document which creates a right in favour of some person and 
which is freely transferable  Although the Act mentions only these three 
instruments 
 Such as a promissory note  a bill of exchange and cheque  it does 
not exclude the possibility of adding any other instrument which satisfies 
the following two conditions of negotiability 
a  The instrument should be freely transferable  by delivery or by 
endorsement and delivery  by the custom of the trade  and 
b  The person who obtains it in good faith and for value should get 
it free from all defects  and be entitled to recover the money of the 
instrument in his own name 
As such  documents like share warrants payable to bearer  debentures 
payable to bearer and dividend warrants are negotiable instruments  But 
the money orders and postal orders  deposit receipts  share certificates 
bill of lading  dock warrant  etc  are not negotiable instruments  Although 
they are transferable by delivery and endorsements  yet they are not able 
to give better title to the bona fide transferee for value than what the 
transferor has 
 Notes 
Features of a Negotiable Instrument 
A negotiable instrument has the following characteristics 
  Property  The possessor of the negotiable instrument is presumed 
to be the owner of the property contained therein  A negotiable 
instrument does not merely give possession of the instrument but 
right to property also  The property in a negotiable instrument 
can be transferred without any formality  In the case of bearer 
instrument  the property passes by mere delivery to the transferee 
In the case of an order instrument  endorsement and delivery are 
required for the transfer of property 
  Title  The transferee of a negotiable instrument is known as  holder 
in due course  A bona fide transferee for value is not affected by any 
defect of title on the part of the transferor or of any of the previous 
holders of the instrument 
  Rights  The transferee of the negotiable instrument can sue in his 
own name  in case of dishonour  A negotiable instrument can be 
transferred any number of times till it is at maturity  The holder of 
the instrument need not give notice of transfer to the party who is 
liable to pay on that instrument 
  Presumptions  Certain presumptions apply to all negotiable 
instruments e g  a presumption that consideration has been paid 
under it  It is not necessary to write in a promissory note the words 
 for value received  or similar expressions because the payment of 
consideration is presumed  The words are usually included to create 
additional evidence of consideration 
  Prompt payment  A negotiable instrument enables the holder to 
expect prompt payment because a dishonour means the ruin of the 
credit of all persons who are parties to the instrument 
Presumptions as to Negotiable Instrument 
Sections   and   of the Negotiable Instrument Act lay down 
certain presumptions which the court presumes in regard to negotiable 
instruments  In other words  these presumptions need not be proved 
as they are presumed to exist in every negotiable instrument  Until the 
 Notes 
contrary is proved the following presumptions shall be made in case of all 
negotiable instruments 
  Consideration  It shall be presumed that every negotiable instru- 
ment was made drawn  accepted or endorsed for consideration  It is 
presumed that  consideration is present in every negotiable instru- 
ment until the contrary is presumed  The presumption of consid- 
eration  however may be rebutted by proof that the instrument had 
been obtained from  its lawful owner by means of fraud or undue 
influence 
  Date  Where a negotiable instrument is dated  the presumption is 
that it has been made or drawn on such date  unless the contrary is 
proved 
  Time of acceptance  Unless the contrary is proved  every accepted bill 
of exchange is presumed to have been accepted within a reasonable 
time after its issue and before its maturity  This presumption only 
applies when the acceptance is not dated  if the acceptance bears a 
date  it will prima facie be taken as evidence of the date on which it 
was made 
  Time of transfer  Unless the contrary is proved it shall be presumed 
that every transfer of a negotiable instrument was made before its 
maturity 
  Order of endorsement  Until the contrary is proved it shall be 
presumed that the endorsements appearing upon a negotiable 
instrument were made in the order in which they appear thereon 
  Stamp  Unless the contrary is proved  it shall be presumed that a 
lost promissory note  bill of exchange or cheque was duly stamped 
  Holder in due course  Until the contrary is proved  it shall be 
presumed that the holder of a negotiable instrument is the holder 
in due course  Every holder of a negotiable instrument is presumed 
to have paid consideration for it and to have taken it in good faith 
But if the instrument was obtained from its lawful owner by means 
of an offence or fraud  the holder has to prove that he is a holder in 
due course 
  Proof of protest  Section   lays down that in a suit upon an 
instrument which has been dishonoured  the court shall on proof 
 Notes 
of the protest  presume the fact of dishonour  unless and until such 
fact is disproved 
Types of Negotiable Instrument 
Section   of the  Negotiable Instruments Act  states that a 
negotiable instrument is a promissory note  bill of exchange or a cheque 
payable either to order or to bearer 
Negotiable instruments ecognized by statute are 
a  Promissory notes 
b  Bills of exchange 
c  Cheques 
Negotiable instruments recognized by usage or custom are Hundis 
Bankers draft  Share warrants  Dividend warrants  Circular notes  Bearer 
debentures  Debentures of Bombay Port Trust  Railway receipts and 
Delivery orders 
This list of negotiable instrument is not a closed chapter  With the 
growth of commerce  new kinds of securities may claim recognition as 
negotiable instruments  Let us see the meaning of promissory note  bill of 
exchange  cheque and hundi 
  Promissory notes  Section   of the Act defines   A promissory note 
is an instrument in writing  note being a bank-note or a currency 
note  containing an unconditional undertaking  signed by the 
maker  to pay a certain sum of money to or to the order of a certain 
person  or to the bearer of the instruments  The essential elements 
of promissory notes include 
a   It must be in writing 
b   It must certainly an express promise or clear understanding to 
pay 
c   Promise to pay must be unconditional 
d   It should be signed by the maker 
e   The maker must be certain 
 Notes 
f   The payee must be certain 
g   The promise should be to pay money and money only 
h   The amount should be certain  and 
i   Other formalities regarding number  place  date  consideration 
etc  though usually found given in the promissory notes but are 
not essential in law 
  Bill of exchange  Section   of the Act defines   A bill of exchange 
is an instrument in writing containing an unconditional order 
signed by the maker  directing a certain person to pay a certain 
sum of money only to  or to the order of a certain person or to the 
bearer of the instrument  A bill of exchange  therefore  is a written 
acknowledgement of the debt  written by the creditor and accepted 
by the debtor  There are usually three parties to a bill of exchange 
drawer  acceptor or drawee and payee  Drawer himself may be the 
payee  For example  If A sells goods to B on credit basis for    
and draws a bill on B  If B accepts the bill  then it becomes the 
liability for B to pay the agreed sum within the stipulated time  The 
essential conditions of a bill of exchange include 
a   It must be in writing 
b   It must be signed by the drawer 
c   The drawer  drawee and payee must be certain 
d   The sum payable must also be certain 
e   It should be properly stamped 
f   It must contain an express order to pay money and money alone 
g   The order must be unconditional 
  Cheques  Section   of the Act defines  A cheque is a bill of exchange 
drawn on a specified banker  and not expressed to be payable 
otherwise than on demand  A cheque is bill of exchange with two 
more qualifications  namely   i  it is always drawn on a specified 
banker  and  ii  it is always payable on demand  Consequently  all 
cheques are bill of exchange  but all bills are not cheque  A cheque 
must satisfy all the requirements of a bill of exchange  that is  it 
must be signed by the drawer  and must contain an unconditional 
order on a specified banker to pay a certain sum of money to or to 
the order of a certain person or to the bearer of the cheque  It does 
not require acceptance 
 Notes 
  Hundis  A  Hundi  is a negotiable instrument written in an oriental 
language  The term hundi includes all indigenous negotiable 
instrument whether they be in the form of notes or bills  The 
word  hundi  is said to be derived from the Sanskrit word  hundi 
which means  to collect  They are quite popular among the Indian 
merchants from very old days  They are used to finance trade and 
commerce and served as easy and sound medium of currency and 
credit  Hundis are governed by the custom and usage of the locality 
in which they are intended to be used and not by the provision of 
the Negotiable Instruments Act  In case there is no customary rule 
known as to a certain point  the court may apply the provisions 
of the Negotiable Instruments Act  It is also open to the parties to 
expressly exclude the applicability of any custom relating to hundis 
by agreement 
  Bankers draft  A draft payable by a bank in cash on presentation 
  Share warrant  A certificate  usually issued along with a bond or 
preferred stock  entitling the holder to buy a specific amount of 
securities at a specific price  usually above the current market price 
at the time of issuance  for an extended period  anywhere from a 
few years to forever  In the case that the price of the security rises to 
above that of the warrant s exercise price  then the investor can buy 
the security at the warrant s exercise price and resell it for a profit 
Otherwise  the warrant will simply expire or remain unused 
  Dividend warrant  A cheque which makes payment of a dividend 
  Circular notes  Similar instruments to  letters of credit  They 
are drawn by resident bankers upon their foreign correspondents 
in favor of persons traveling abroad  The correspondents must 
be satisfied of the identity of the applicant  before payment  and 
the requisite proof of such identity is usually furnished  upon the 
applicant s producing a letter with his signature  by a comparison of 
the signatures 
  Bearer debentures  Bearer debentures do not show the name of the 
owner on the debenture  The holders of the bearer debenture are 
entitled to receive interest payment on the due dates 
 Notes 
Cheque 
According to Section   of the Negotiable Instruments Act  a cheque 
is defined  see the definition given in the last section  A cheque is a 
negotiable instrument which is supplied by a banker to the customer who 
opens a savings or current account in a bank 
Parties to a Cheque  The customer who draws the cheque on the 
bank is called capital drawer  The bank on whom the cheque is drawn 
is called the drawee  The person who receives payment on the cheque is 
called the payee  Thus  there are three parties to a cheque 
  Drawer  He is the person who draws the cheque  i e  the depositor 
of money in the bank 
  Drawee  It is the drawer s banker on whom the cheque has been 
drawn 
  Payee  He is the person who is entitled to receive the payment of 
the cheque 
A savings account holder may have an account with cheque or 
without cheque facility  But all the current account holders will be provided 
a cheque book  A cheque is a printed leaf supplied by the banker and it 
consists of a book of   or   printed leaves  In the modern days  in all the 
metropolitan cities the cheques supplied by the bank to the customer are 
called MICR Cheques i e  Magnetic Ink Character Recognition 
This means that cheque contains a white patch at the bottom 
in which numbers are given in magnetic form which represents not 
only the number of the cheque but also the code number of branch and 
bank  To facilitate mechanical sorting the code line contains the following 
numbers 
     
The first   numbers signify the cheque number 
     
The second   numbers signify the city code 
     
The third   numbers signify the bank code 
     
The fourth   numbers signify the branch code of the bank 
 Notes 
Features of a Cheque 
Following are the features of a cheque 
  It is an instrument in writing 
  A cheque is to be drawn only on the branch in which the customer 
is maintaining an account 
  Before drawing a cheque  the customer must have sufficient funds 
in his account or else  the cheque will be dishonoured 
  A cheque is an order by the customer on the bank and so the cheque 
must be very clear in the instructions given to the banker 
  As the cheque is meant for payment of money  the amount mentioned 
in the cheque should be specific and it should be written both in 
words and figures  If there is any difference in the amount written 
in words and figures  the cheque will be dishonoured 
  A cheque is payable to a specific person  This may be an individual 
or a firm or a body corporate that have an account in the bank 
At the same time  to receive payment on cheque  an individual on 
whom the cheque is drawn need not have an account  But when the 
cheque is given to an individual is crossed  he must have an account 
in the bank or else he cannot receive payment 
  A cheque is payable either to order or bearer  An order cheque is 
one which is payable only to a specific person or to whom so ever 
he orders  An order cheque is one which is drawn in the following 
manner 
Specimen of a Cheque 
X Bank of India 
Chennai 
Pay to Y   or Bearer 
Rupees  
 
S  B  A c No 
       
 Notes 
In the above cheque format the word or bearer will be struck in 
the case of an order cheque  For example   Pay to Y  or bearer  when the 
word or bearer is struck  it becomes an order cheque payable only to Y or 
whom so ever he orders  When Y wants to transfer  he will have to endorse 
the cheque by signing on the back side of the cheque and deliver it to the 
transferee  But when it is a bearer cheque  Y can simply hand over the 
cheque to any party to whom he wants to transfer  In the case of a bearer 
cheque  the word or bearer will not be cancelled 
Whether a cheque is a bearer cheque or order cheque  it depends 
on the intention of the drawer of a cheque  If it is a bearer cheque  it will 
remain a bearer cheque once for all  On the other hand  when a cheque is 
converted into order cheque by cancelling the order or bearer  the cheque 
will permanently remain as an order cheque  Here again once an order 
cheque will remain an order cheque forever 
  Signature is an important aspect in a cheque  A cheque should be 
signed by the customer and the signature in the cheque should be as 
per the specimen signature given by the account holder at the time 
of opening the account  In case  a customer adopts a different style 
of signature  he must furnish to the bank  a set of fresh specimen 
signatures and cancel the old specimen signature 
  Date appearing on the cheque is a date on which the cheque is 
said to have been issued  A banker will make payment on a cheque 
either on the date of the cheque or subsequently but not before the 
date  A post-dated cheque will never be honoured by the bank  Date 
also decides the valid period of the cheque  which is normally six 
months 
  The number appearing on the cheque at the bottom represents the 
cheque number and code number of the bank  When the cheque is 
presented in the clearing house the computer decodes the cheque 
and by this the name of the bank  the branch and the cheque number 
with the amount is available which will be prepared in a statement 
when banks take the cheque to the clearing house for realization 
  Endorsements are done when an order cheque is transferred and the 
endorsements appearing on the cheque mention clearly the manner 
in which the cheque is transferred from one person to another 
 Notes 
According to Sections   and   of the Negotiable Instruments 
Act  endorsement should appear in the same sequence in which the 
cheque is transferred from one person to another  This enables the 
banker to find out as to who is liable in case of dishonour 
Crossing of a Cheque 
Definition of Crossing 
Section   to    A  of the Negotiable Instruments Act deal about 
crossing of a cheque  There are two types of crossing  They are   General 
crossing and   Special crossing  Section   defines general crossing of 
cheque while Section   defines special crossing 
General Crossing  According to Section    where a cheque bears 
across its face an addition of the words  And Company  or any abbreviation 
thereof  between two parallel transverse lines  or two parallel transverse 
lines simply  either with or without the words  Not Negotiable  that 
addition shall be deemed a crossing  and the cheque shall be deemed to be 
crossed generally 
Special Crossing  According to Section    where a cheque bears 
across in face an addition of the name of the banker  either with or without 
the words  Not Negotiable  that addition shall be deemed a crossing and 
the cheque shall be deemed to be crossed specially and to be crossed to 
that banker 
Introduction of Crossing 
Crossing of cheques is introduced in the beginning of   th century 
as banks in England were experiencing pilferage of cheques when they 
were being taken in coaches to the Central Bank for clearance  To prevent 
such pilferage  cheques were crossed after which the missing cheques could 
be easily traced as the crossed cheques could be encashed only through an 
account  Thus  the introduction of crossing had not only prevented stealing 
of cheques but had also enabled the bank to find out which account holder 
had received the cheque and received a payment 
 Notes 
Who can Cross a Cheque 
A cheque can be crossed by four persons 
  Drawer  When a drawer issues a cheque to a party  he will cross the 
cheque either generally or specially 
  Holder  When a cheque is given to the holder by the drawer without 
crossing  the holder can cross the cheque  But  if the cheque is 
already crossed and crossed generally  the holder can convert it 
into special crossing  But  a cheque crossed specially cannot be 
converted into general crossing 
  Holder in due course  A holder in due course can also cross the 
cheque provided the cheque is not crossed or crossed generally 
When a holder in due course receives an open cheque  he can cross 
the cheque generally  it can be converted into special crossing  But 
he cannot convert special crossing onto general crossing 
  Banker  A banker can cross a cheque when he receives it for 
collection  A collecting banker normally accepts a crossed cheque 
on behalf of the customer for the purpose of collection  But when 
the collecting banker receives an open cheque without any crossing 
the banker himself will cross the cheque before sending it for 
collection 
What Constitutes Crossing of a Cheque 
When a cheque is crossed across the face with two transverse 
parallel lines  it is said to be crossed  In between the two parallel lines  the 
cheque will contain words such as  And Company  or an abbreviation as  
Co  such cheque is said to be crossed generally 
When a cheque is crossed it implies two things 
  Payment will not be made across the counter by a bank when a 
crossed cheque is presented 
  The crossed cheque will have to be presented in an account through 
a pay-in-slip 
 Notes 
If a banker makes the payment of a crossed cheque across the 
counter  it is a gross violation of payment in due course  When a cheque 
goes to an account  it will be credited and the amount can be withdrawn 
only by a separate cheque  In General crossing  the cheque will bear across 
the two parallel transverse lines    types of words  These are 
  Not Negotiable 
  Account Payee 
    Not Negotiable crossing  When a cheque bears across its face 
two transverse parallel lines with the words not negotiable  it is a 
clear indication to the banker that the bank has to be very careful 
while making the payment on the cheque  Not negotiable takes 
away the character of negotiability on a cheque  It means that if 
there is any defect in the cheque  it will affect the transferee  even 
if the transferee is a holder in due course  Thus  not negotiable 
crossing is a forewarning given to all the transferees of the cheque 
that they should be careful while receiving the cheque even if they 
happened to be a holder in due course  In real life we come across 
 Not Negotiable  crossing when companies are sending dividend 
warrants to their shareholders  When lakhs of shareholders 
are receiving cheques  it can be altered  or the payees  names 
can be changed without the knowledge of the bank  If a banker 
overlooking this alteration  credits the account of the customer  it 
is the bank that will be liable and not the drawer company  Hence 
a  Not Negotiable  crossing gives caution to the banker and the 
bank has to take utmost precaution while making payment on the 
cheque containing not negotiable crossing  Otherwise  the banker 
will be held liable for negligence  A bank cannot claim protection 
even as a holder in due course 
   
Account Payee crossing  Though Not Negotiable crossing 
is mentioned nowhere in the Section   of the Negotiable 
Instruments Act  account payee crossing is mentioned  This means 
that account payee crossing is not legally permitted under the 
Negotiable Instruments Act  The reason is that when a cheque 
is crossed account payee only  payment should be credited by the 
bank only to the account of the payee  An example is given below 
 Notes 
Pay to X 
This means that the bank has to credit the account of X only and 
the cheque is not transferable to any other person  This goes against 
the principle of negotiability and transferability  Hence  the Negotiable 
Instruments Act has not recognized the account payee crossing but by 
custom a banker allows the account payee crossing and so the courts have 
agreed such crossing by custom and not by statute 
The following diagrams show general crossing and special crossing 
Special Crossing  Section   defines special crossing wherein 
the cheque will contain the name of another bank in the crossing  Special 
crossing does not require two parallel transverse lines  It may or may not 
exist 
 Notes 
ou 
State Bank of India 
Chennai 
Pay to Y   or Bearer 
Rupees  
 
S  B  A c No 
       
This cheque is said to be crossed specially  In this cheque  State 
Bank of India is the paying banker and Indian Bank is the collecting 
banker  When the cheque is presented in the clearing house  State Bank of 
India should pay on this cheque only to Indian Bank which presents it  If 
any other bank presents this cheque  State Bank of India should not pay 
Thus  a clear instruction is given by the drawer of the cheque or any other 
holder that payment should be made through Indian Bank 
The above cheque can also be drawn with the name of Indian Bank 
appearing along with words Account Payee only  In such a case  State Bank 
of India will pay to the Indian Bank which will be crediting account of the 
payee in whose name the cheque is drawn  The cheque is not transferable 
to any other person  Similarly  along with the Indian Bank name in the 
special crossing  there may be words such as  not negotiable  This again is 
an indication that the paying banker State Bank of India should be careful 
so also the collecting banker  Indian Bank  It should take more precautions 
while crediting the account of the customer  Unless the customer presenting 
the cheque is a genuine person  the cheque with the words not negotiable 
cannot be credited 
Double Special Crossing or Double Crossing  Normally in a 
special crossing  the paying banker will pay only to that bank whose name 
is appearing in that crossing  But sometimes  the bank whose name is 
appearing in the crossing may not find a branch in the place where the 
payee is to present the cheque  For example  a cheque belonging to Indian 
Bank with a crossing of Bank of Tamil Nadu is sent to a person in Punjab 
Since  the Bank of Tamil Nadu does not have a branch in Punjab  Indian 
Bank at Punjab will find it difficult to pay on the cheque  Hence  Bank of 
Tamil Nadu will appoint Punjab National Bank as its agent for collection 
Now the crossing will appear as below 
 Notes 
Bank of Tamil Nadu 
to 
Punjab National Bank 
as agent for collection 
If in this crossing  the word as agent for collection is not there 
Indian Bank which is a paying banker will refuse to pay on the cheque 
according to Section   of the Negotiable Instruments Act  Thus  a paying 
banker will have to be careful and the collecting banker also must write 
the words as agent for collection  failing which he cannot receive payment 
of the cheque 
Liability of a Paying Banker on a Crossed Cheque 
A paying banker has to be careful while making payment on a 
crossed cheque  Especially  when the crossing contains certain special 
instructions such as account payee or not negotiable  Under Section  
of the Negotiable Instruments Act  the paying banker has to pay only 
to that banker whose name is appearing in the crossing of the cheque 
Otherwise  the paying banker will be liable 
According to Section 
  the paying banker has to strictly observe the crossing on the cheque 
as per the instructions given in the crossing  A paying banker is liable to 
two parties when he fails to observe the crossing 
  Liable to true owner  When a cheque is drawn in the name of X 
and crossed account payee only  it is the duty of the paying banker 
to pay or credit the account of X failing which the owner of the 
cheque can sue the paying banker  The paying banker should also 
be careful when the cheque contains crossing as not negotiable  If 
due care is not taken  the paying banker commits the mistake of 
negligence  Now the paying banker will be liable to the true owner 
not only for the amount of the cheque but also for any damages for 
refusal to pay 
  To the Drawer  The paying banker is liable to the drawer for not 
complying with instruction as given in the cheque  It is not only 
making payment to an account but payment as per the instructions 
in the crossing is also a must  So  when there is a violation and when 
the paying banker has not observed the instruction given in the 
 Notes 
crossing  the drawer will make the paying banker liable and can also 
claim damages  The paying banker also looses statutory protection 
Lifting of crossing or Opening of Crossing  A cheque containing 
a crossing is called a crossed cheque  But when the crossing in the cheque 
is cancelled by the drawer by himself with his full signature at the place of 
cancellation in the cheque  then the cheque becomes an open cheque  in 
which case  the banker can make payment across the counter  Other than 
drawer  no other person is authorized to lift the crossing 
Obliterating of crossing  When the crossing in the cheque is erased 
deliberately by persons other than the drawer to defraud the drawer or the 
drawee  and the banker without looking at such erasing of crossing makes 
payments on the cheque  the banker is set to have committed the mistake 
of violating Section   i e  payment in due course  The paying banker can 
claim protection in the case of obliterating of crossing provided he has 
made payment but strictly adhering to payment in due course  In other 
words  the banker could not find out the obliterating of crossing even after 
a careful scrutiny of the cheque 
Endorsement of Cheque 
Transfer of negotiable instruments  Negotiable instruments are 
those which can be transferred from one person to another either by mere 
delivery  if it is a bearer instrument or by endorsement and delivery if it is 
an order instrument  By such a transfer  the transferee becomes the owner 
of the instrument according to Section   of the negotiable instrument act 
In the normal day to day life  we normally do not come across endorsement 
as most of us have only savings account 
Endorsement is applicable only to an order instrument and is 
accepted only in current account  In savings account  only cheques drawn 
in the name of the account holder are accepted and no third party cheques 
will be accepted by the bank  Whereas in the current account  third party 
cheques are accepted and an order cheque drawn in the name of a third 
party can be deposited when the third party endorses the cheque in favor 
of the account holder and delivers the same 
 Notes 
An order cheque is written by cancelling the words  or bearer  in 
the cheque by the drawer at the time of issuing it  If a cheque is drawn in 
the name of Mr  X  and as an order cheque  Mr  X will have to endorse if he 
wants to transfer it to Y  This means X will have to sign on the reverse side 
of the cheque and handover the same to Y  This is called blank endorsement 
Mr  X can also write on the reverse side as  Pay to Y  and sign  This is full 
endorsement  Mr  X  who endorses the cheque  is called the endorser and 
Mr  Y to whom the cheque is endorsed is the endorsee  Thus  there are two 
parties to an endorsement   endorser and endorsee  Endorse is the one 
who transfers  Endorsee is the transferee 
Thus  an endorsement is a process by which an order instrument 
is transferred  An endorsement is said to be complete only when the 
instrument is delivered by the endorser to the endorsee  The transfer 
may be physical or constructive  When an endorser after endorsing the 
negotiable instrument  hands over to the endorsee  it is called physical 
transfer  If the endorser after endorsing the instrument  informs the 
endorsee either by phone or through any person and asks the endorsee to 
collect the instrument it is called constructive delivery 
Endorsement is defined under Section   of the Negotiable 
Instrument Act as  When the maker or holder of a negotiable instrument 
signs the same  otherwise than as such maker  for the purpose of negotiation 
on the back or face thereof or on a slip of paper annexed thereto or so 
signs for the same purpose a stamped paper intended to be completed as a 
negotiable instrument  he is said to have endorsed the same and is called 
the endorser 
Legal Effects of the Transfer by Endorsement 
 a  Transfer of ownership  When a negotiable instrument is endorsed 
and delivered  the endorsee not only becomes absolute owner but 
also has the right to further transfer the instrument by endorsement 
Even if the legal relationship existing prior to endorsement gets 
terminated  it will not affect the transfer of ownership under 
endorsement  If the relationship between a principal and agent 
gets terminated after the principal endorsing the instrument to the 
agent  the effects of endorsement remain  by the agent becoming 
the owner of the instrument  The termination of legal relationship 
 Notes 
will not affect the transfer and so the drawee of the instrument is 
liable to the agent and cannot escape the liability  If the principal 
dies  the agent will have the right on the instrument and the agent 
can further endorse the instrument or encash the instrument by 
presenting it on the due date with the drawee 
 b  Presumption under Section   The order or sequence in which 
the instrument is transferred  in the same order  the endorsement 
should appear on the reverse side of the instrument  Thus  when the 
instrument is dishonoured by the drawee it is easy for the endorsee 
to know his previous endorser and can fix the liability  Section  
presumes that the instrument is transferred in the same order in 
which the endorsement is appearing on the instrument 
 c  Joint endorsement  When an instrument is held jointly  all the 
joint owners have to endorse the instrument  Similarly  when an 
instrument is endorsed in favour of more than one person  all the 
endorsees will sign when they further endorse the instrument 
 d  Endorsement for full amount  When an instrument is endorsed 
in favour of an endorsee  the entire amount in the instrument is 
transferred in the favour of the endorsee  Part endorsement in favour 
of different parties is not allowed  The legal effect of endorsement 
completely transfers the ownership in favour of endorsee and not 
partly in favour of endorsee 
 e  Endorsement within stipulate time  The endorsement of a 
negotiable instrument must be done and received by the endorsee 
within the time limit or maturity of the instrument  A cheque must 
be endorsed and delivered within six months from the date of the 
cheque or else the endorsement will become ineffective 
 f  Endorsement to be followed by delivery  An endorsement is said 
to be complete only when it is followed by delivery  The endorser 
after the endorsement may physically deliver the instrument to the 
endorsee or he may inform the endorsee to collect the instrument 
endorsed in his favour  which is constructive delivery  If an endorser 
after the endorsement and before delivery dies  the endorsement 
is not complete and the endorsee cannot claim the ownership 
Even the legal heirs of the deceased cannot deliver in favour of the 
endorsee 
 Notes 
Rules Pertaining to Endorsement 
  Allonge  When an instrument is endorsed  if there is no more 
space for further endorsement  a paper will be attached with the 
instrument for further endorsement  This paper is called allonge 
When an allonge is attached  the last endorsement appearing on 
the instrument will once again appear as the first endorsement in 
the allonge  This procedure is adopted for avoiding any mix up of 
allonges with various other instruments 
  Signature  An endorsement is complete only when it is endorsed by 
the owner of the instrument or any of his authorized agents  who is 
allowed to endorse on his behalf  If there are more than one person 
owning  all of them have to endorse and only then the endorsement 
is said to be complete 
  Correct initial and Name  The endorser should be sign the 
instrument in the same spelling and initial and then give the correct 
name and initial  For example  if a cheque is endorsed for Ramoo 
and then given below his correct spelling as Ramu  The same applies 
to wrong initial also 
  Endorsement by 
 a   
Married Woman  When a cheque is drawn in favour of Mrs 
Kannan  Now when MTrs  Kannan endorses  she will have to 
sign as Lata Kannan and the endorsement will appear as 
Sindhu Ramesh 
 Wife of Mr  Ramesh 
That is  the christened name will appear first followed by her 
husband s name 
In the case of unmarried woman  if a cheque is drawn in favour 
of Miss  Raman  she will endorse in her christened name followed by her 
father s name 
Gayathri Sarvesh 
 daughter of Mr  Sarvesh 
 Notes 
 b   
Illiterate person  When a cheque is drawn in favour of 
illiterate person  and when he wants to endorse  his thumb 
impression will have to be affixed and it should be followed by 
the signature and address of the witness 
 c   
Partnership firm  When a partnership firm is endorsing a 
cheque  it should be signed by the partner who is authorized 
by the firm to endorse 
M s  Hanshika Sarvesh   Sons 
Sadhanaa 
Partner 
 d   
Company  When a company is endorsing a cheque  it should

working in army  navy or air force  the cheque will be drawn along 
with their rank  Example  Pay to Major Vijay  Now this cheque will 
be endorsed by Major Vijay as

Maj 
 Notes 
Kinds of Endorsements 
  Blank endorsement  When an endorsement is made on the reverse 
side of the instrument with a mere signature of the endorser without 
any name or any other remark  it is called blank endorsement 
  Full endorsement  When the endorser writes the name of the 
endorsee on the reverse side of the instrument such as  Pay to Raju 
or order  Sd  Krish  Here  the endorser is Krish and the endorsee 
is Raju  Thus  the full endorsement is complete in all respects 
  Conditional Endorsement  Where an endorsement is made with a 
specific condition to be fulfilled by the endorsee for acquiring the 
ownership right on the instrument  it is conditional endorsement 
Example  Pay to Raju on delivery of bill of lading   Sd  Krish  Raju 
will be given instrument or the amount on the instrument only 
when he delivers bill of lading 
  Restrictive endorsement  Here  the endorser takes away the right of 
the endorsee for further endorsement of the instrument  Example 
Pay to Raju only   Sd Krishnan  Now this type of endorsement 
restricts further transfer of the instrument  This takes away the 
fundamental character of negotiable instrument  which is one of 
transferability 
  Sans-recourse endorsement  When the endorser informs the 
endorsee that in case of the dishonour of the instrument  the 
endorsee cannot make the endorser liable  the endorsee can only 
catch hold of any other party on the instrument but not the endorser 
Example  Pay to Raju Sans-recourse   Sd  Krishnan  Here  in case of 
dishonour of the instrument  Krish cannot be held liable as he has 
endorsed the instrument Sans-recourse is stop taking action 
  Sans-frais endorsement  When the endorser informs the endorsee 
that any expenses incurred in receiving payment on the instrument 
should not be debited to the account of the endorser 
  Facultative endorsement  When the endorser excuses the endorsee 
from performing any duty in the case of dishonour  Example  Pay 
to Raju  Notice of dishonour waived 
 Sd  Krishnan  From 
this endorsement  the endorser does not escape his liability in case 
of dishonour of the instrument 
 Notes 
Developments in Collection and Payment of Cheques - Cheque 
Truncation System  CTS 
Cheque Truncation 
Truncation is the process of stopping the flow of the physical cheque 
issued by a drawer to the drawee branch  The physical instrument will be 
truncated at some point en-route to the drawee branch and an electronic 
image of the cheque would be sent to the drawee branch along with the 
relevant information like the MICR fields  date of presentation  presenting 
banks etc  Thus  with the implementation of cheque truncation  the need 
to move the physical instruments across branches would not be required 
except in exceptional circumstances  This would effectively reduce the 
time required for payment of cheques  the associated cost of transit and 
delay in processing  etc  thus speeding up the process of collection or 
realization of the cheques 
Need for Cheque Truncation in India 
Cheque Truncation speeds up collection of cheques and therefore 
enhances customer service  reduces the scope for clearing related frauds 
minimizes cost of collection of cheques  reduces reconciliation problems 
eliminates logistics problems etc  With the other major product offering 
in the form of RTGS  the Reserve Bank created the capability to enable 
inter-bank payments online real time and facilitate corporate customer 
payments  The other product  National Electronic Funds Transfer  is an 
electronic credit transfer system 
However  to wish away cheques is simply not possible and that is the 
reason why the Bank decided to focus on improving the efficiency of the 
Cheque Clearing Cycle  Cheque Truncation is the alternative  Moreover 
contrary to perceptions  Cheque Truncation is a more secure system than 
the current exchange of physical documents in which the cheque moves 
from one point to another  thus  not only creating delays but inconvenience 
to the customer in case the instrument is lost in transit or manipulated 
during the clearing cycle  In addition to operational efficiency  Cheque 
Truncation has several benefits to the banks and customers which includes 
introduction of new products  re-engineering the total receipts and 
payments mechanism of the customers  human resource rationalization 
 Notes 
cost effectiveness  etc  Cheque Truncation  thus  is an important efficiency 
enhancement initiative in the Payments Systems area  undertaken by RBI 
Uniqueness of the Cheque to be Imparted to the Image 
The images captured at the presenting bank level would be 
transmitted to the Clearing House and then to the drawee branches with 
digital signatures of the presenting bank  Thus  each image would carry the 
digital signature  apart from the physical endorsement of the presenting 
bank  in a prescribed manner  In order to ensure only images of requisite 
quality reach the drawee branches  there will be a quality check process at 
the level of the Capture Systems and the Clearing House Interface  This 
would ensure only images of requisite quality secured with the digital 
signatures of the presenting banks reach the drawee branches  In addition 
drawers could consider using holograms  barcoding or such other features 
which would add to the uniqueness of the images 
Implementation of Cheque Truncation Method Proposed by RBI 
Reserve Bank of India  RBI  is proposing to implement the project 
on a PILOT basis in the National Capital Region  NCR  New Delhi  Based 
on the experienced gathered  it would consider extending the coverage to 
other centres  In the process of implementation  banks have been given 
the freedom to decide the point of truncation  RBI would be installing 
an interface with its system  Clearing House Interface - CHI  at the ser- 
vice branches of banks  who are members of New-Delhi Bankers Clearing 
House  Banks have to decide the point of truncation and have to ensure 
that the images are digitally signed after their capture  It would flow there- 
after to the interface  CHI  provided by RBI  from where the images would 
flow to the clearing House with the digital signatures of the banks  These 
digitally signed images would reach the service branches of the drawee 
branches clearing house interface  The service branches have to ensure that 
these images are moved across their branches to ensure their processing 
Support from RBI to Facilitate Cheque Truncation 
RBI s services include system development and installation at 
the clearing house  interfaces at the bank s end  network  handholding 
awareness propagation and training 
 Notes 
Entire Process Flow Envisaged in the CTS 
The CTS project envisages a safe  secured  faster and effective sys- 
tem for clearing of the cheques  In the CTS  the presenting bank will cap- 
ture the data   images of the cheques using their Capture System which 
is internal to them  They have to meet the specifications and standards 
prescribed for data and images  To ensure security  safety and non-repudi- 
ation the PKI  Public Key Infrastructure  is being implemented across the 
system  The banks will send the captured images and data to the central 
clearing house for onward transmission to the payee drawee banks  For 
that purpose RBI will be providing the banks software called the Clearing 
House Interface  CHI  that will enable them to connect and transmit data 
in a secure way and with non-repudiation to the Clearing House  CH  The 
Clearing House will process the data and arrive at the settlement figure for 
the banks and send the required data to payee drawee banks for processing 
at their end  The drawee payee banks will use the same CHI mentioned 
earlier for receiving the data and images from the Clearing House  It will 
be the responsibility of the drawee bank Capture System to process the in- 
ward data and images and generate the return file for unpaid instruments 
Participants in the Cheque Truncation System 
The criteria for banks participating in the Cheque truncation 
system are 
 a  Membership of the clearing house in the NCR 
 b  Membership of the Indian Financial Network  INFINET 
Participation by Non-INFINET Member Banks 
In respect of banks who are not members of the INFINET  the 
following alternatives are available 
 a   
They may become the sub-members of the direct members 
 b   Such banks may use the infrastructure of the other banks having 
INFINET membership without being the INFINET members 
themselves and their clearing settlement can be done either directly 
or through the member through whom they are participating 
 Notes 
Infrastructure Requirements for Banks 
The infrastructure required for CTS from bank s end are connec- 
tivity from the bank gateway to the clearing house  hardware and software 
for the CTS applications  RBI shall be providing member banks with the 
CHI and the banks have to procure other hardware and system software 
for the CHI and the application software for their capture systems on their 
own  The hardware requirement is based on the volume of the cheques 
processed by the banks  Based on the volume the CHI is categorized into 
four types and the hardware requirement is different for each category 
The band width requirement for each bank is calculated based a number 
of factors like the peak inward and outward volume of the bank  average 
size of an image  efficiency factor of the network etc  In addition to that 
future requirement have been taken into consideration for calculating the 
band with requirement 
Image Specifications in the CTS 
Imaging of cheques can be based on various technology options 
The cheque images can be black and white  Grey Scale or coloured  Black 
and White images do not reveal all the subtle features that are there in 
the cheques  Coloured Images increase storage and network bandwidth 
requirements  So it was decided that the electronic images of truncated 
cheques will be in gray scale technology  There will be three images of the 
cheques i e  front grey  front black   white and back black   white which 
will be made available to member banks 
Ensuring Quality of the Images 
As the payments will be made on the basis of the images  it is es- 
sential to ensure the quality of the images  For that purpose the solution 
proposes Image Quality Audit  IQA  at different level  RBI will be speci- 
fying the image standards to the member banks  The presenting bank is 
required to perform the quality audit during the capture itself  Further 
quality audit will be done at the gateway before onward transmission to 
clearing house  Further  the drawee bank can ask for the physical instru- 
ment if it is not satisfied that the image quality is not good enough for 
payment processing 
 Notes 
Security of Image and Data Transmitted Over the Network 
The security  integrity  non-repudiation and authenticity of the 
data and image transmitted from the paying bank to payee bank will be 
ensured using the Public Key Infrastructure  PKI  The CTS is compliant 
to the requirement of the IT Act    It has been made mandatory for 
the presenting bank to sign the image   data from the point of origin 
itself  The image and data are secured using the PKI throughout the entire 
cycle covering capture system  the presenting bank  the clearing house 
and the drawee bank  The PKI standards used are in accordance with the 
appropriate Indian acts and practices of IDRBT which is the certifying 
authority for banks   financial institutions in India 
Type of Cheques that can be Presented in the CTS 
All the local cheques can be presented in the CTS  Banks may also 
present cheques on banks situated outside the NCR  but such banks have 
branches in the NCR region  The CTS also supports the intercity clearing 
and specialized clearing like high value clearing etc 
Precautions Required to be Taken by the 
Bank Customers to Avoid Frauds 
Bank customers should use image friendly cheques  They should 
preferably use dark coloured ink while drawing the instruments  Care 
should be exercised in the use of rubber stamp  so that it would not interfere 
with the material portions of the cheque  The date of the cheque  payees 
name  amount and signature are the basic features which are essential 
in a cheque  The use of rubber stamps  etc  should not overshadow the 
clear appearance of these basic features in image  In order to ensure that 
all essential elements of a cheque are captured in an image during the 
scanning process  bank customers have to exercise appropriate care in this 
regard 
Change in the Process for the Customers 
There will be no change in the clearing process  Customers would 
continue to use cheques as at present  except in the use of image friendly 
coloured ink for making the instruments  Of course  such of those 
 Notes 
customers  who used to receive the paid instruments  like Government 
Departments  would only receive cheque images instead of the physical 
instruments  This will also facilitate in better processing at their end  as 
they will be able to access online images in addition to the data 
As the images are going to be moved across  the time taken for the 
receipt of paid instruments at their end could be reduced so that better 
and timely control could be exercised over payments  This will also give an 
early opportunity to the drawers or issuers of cheques to detect frauds or 
alterations in their cheques  It is also possible for cheque issuers to consider 
newer techniques such as embedded verifiable features such as bar-codes 
or logos or watermarks  encrypted codes  holograms  etc  which would 
facilitate early interception of altered forged instruments 
Benefit of Cheque Truncation to Customers of Banks 
Before we answer this question  we have to understand the present 
system of cheque clearance  The cheques presented by customers  today 
are sent to the clearing house at the drawee centres by the beneficiaries 
bank  The cheques at the bigger cities  in view of the large volume of paper 
instruments  are subjected encoding and then to mechanical sorting and 
thereafter reach the drawee branches 
As per the existing banking practice  these instruments received 
at the counters of the drawee branches are paid or returned by them  The 
returned instruments are passed on to the presenting customers through 
the process of a return clearing  Only after the return clearing process 
gets over  banks release the credit to the customers  The beneficiaries 
account gets credited on the same day on which the drawees  account gets 
debited  however  the beneficiary is permitted to use the proceeds only 
after the return clearing process  With the introduction of the imaging 
and truncation  the physical movement of instruments would be stopped 
and the electronic movement of images of cheques would speed up the 
process of settlements and ultimately alter the clearing cycles  The clearing 
cycle could be shortened and it would be possible for customers to realize 
the proceeds of cheques early  Thus  cheque truncation would reduce 
effectively the time of float  i e  time from the point of issue of cheque 
to the point of time the actual debit takes place  In case such clearing is 
introduced across the cities  it would ensure the realization of inter-city 
 Notes 
instruments faster thus ensuring early availability of funds to beneficiaries 
Thus the benefits could be summarized as 
a   
Faster clearing cycle 
b   
B etter reconciliation verification process 
c   
B etter Customer Service and Enhanced Customer Window 
d   
T  for Local Clearing and T     for inter-city clearing

Local Clearing activity is a high cost no revenue activity 
h

i   
Reduces operational risk by securing the transmission route 
What is an Image Replacement Document  IRD 
Under CTS  after the capture of the image  the physical cheque 
would be warehoused with the presenting bank  In case the beneficiary 
or any other connected persons require the instrument  the payee bank 
could issue a copy of the image  under its authentication  which is called 
Image Replacement document  It is a legally recognized replacement of 
the original cheque for re-presentment  The provisions of Negotiable 
Instruments Act  Section  of the NI Act as amended  also permit the 
usage of such IRD  The physical instruments are required to be stored for a 
statutory period  It would be obligatory for presenting bank to warehouse 
the physical instruments for that statutory period  In case a customer 
desires to get a paper instrument back  the instrument can be sourced 
from the presenting bank through the drawee bank 
Conclusion 
Cheque is a negotiable instrument used as a medium of payment 
in all business transactions  There is lot of developments that took place 
in the banking services due to the advances in telecommunication and 
information technology  Cheque truncation service is one such example

Evolution of Central Banking System 
Global Evolution of Central Banking 
Evolution of central banking is essentially a twentieth century 
phenomenon as there were only about a dozen central banks in the world 
at the turn of the twentieth century  In contrast  at present there are nearly 
  central banks  This is not surprising since the need for central banks 
obviously emerged  as banking became more complex  while becoming 
an increasingly important part of the economy over time  Many problems 
experienced by banks and their depositors inevitably led to cries for their 
regulation  Second  central banks are essentially a nation s phenomenon 
Third  it is useful to recall some of the reasons for the origin of central 
banks  to issue currency  to be a banker and lender to the government  to 
regulate and supervise the banks and financial entities  and to serve as a 
lender-of-last-resort 
The new objective function assigned to the central bank is to focus 
on price stability  with financial stability as an additional objective in 
some cases  Two pertinent questions recently being raised relating to the 
independence of the central bank include  First  why is it so obvious that 
central banks should abandon their  parents  the sovereign government 
One quick explanation could be that the central banks have  come-of-age 
in recent years  But then  some instances like the case of two currencies 
in Iraq in the  s and that of the Bank of Japan in recent years provide 
a contrary view to the  come-of-age  hypothesis  Second  is it really the 
case that supervision and regulation of banks by the central bank leads to 
conflict of interest  In consideration of this conflict  the Financial Services 
Authority was established in the UK in   and a number of countries 
have followed suit  In India  we have Financial Stability and Development 
Council 
The Genesis of Central Banking in India 
In   the Royal Commission on Indian Currency and Finance 
 Hilton Young Commission  recommended that dichotomy of functions 
and division of responsibilities for control of currency and credit should be 
ended  The Commission suggested the establishment of a central bank to be 
called the Reserve Bank of India  whose separate existence was considered 
necessary for augmenting banking facilities throughout the country  The 
 Notes 
Bill to establish the Reserve Bank of India  RBI  was introduced in January 
  in the Legislative Assembly  but it was dropped due to differences 
in views regarding ownership  constitution and composition of its Board 
of Directors  The White Paper on Indian Constitutional Reforms  
proposed the setting up of the RBI free from political influences  The 
Indian Central Banking Enquiry Committee   had also strongly 
recommended the establishment of a Reserve Bank  These events led to 
the introduction of a fresh Bill in   The Bill was passed in   and 
the RBI Act came into force on January     The Reserve Bank was 
inaugurated on April    
Central banks occupy a pivotal position in the institutional fabric 
of an economy  The functions of a modern central bank are vastly different 
from what was expected from the early central banks founded in Europe 
in the seventeenth century  The evolution of central banking in the Indian 
context has its own specificity  The RBI  while discharging its statutory 
responsibilities  has played a crucial role in the nation building process 
particularly in the development of the financial sector  In fact  institution 
building constitutes a distinguishing feature of central banking in India 
This following section describes the evolution of central banking in 
India over the period of seventy years since the inception of the Reserve 
Bank in   For analytical convenience  the entire period  - 
is sub-divided into three broad phases  foundation phase  - 
development phase  -  and reform phase   onwards 
a   
Foundation Phase  -  During most of the formation phase 
it was a private bank  though formed under a statute and overseen 
by the then colonial government  The functions of the Bank during 
this phase were confined essentially to traditional central banking 
i e  note issue authority and banker to the Government  During 
the war and post war years  its major preoccupation was facilitation 
of war finance  repatriation of sterling debt and planning and 
administration of exchange control  Upon the nationalization of 
the Bank in   in terms of the Reserve Bank of India  Transfer 
to Public Ownership  Act    and the enactment of the Banking 
Regulation Act    regulation and supervision of banks received 
the focus  On the initiative of the Reserve Bank  the Government 
appointed the Rural Banking Enquiry Committee in  to consider 
important policy issues relating to the extension of banking facilities 
in the country 
 Notes 
b   
Development Phase  -  With the launching of five-year 
plans  the Bank s functions became more diversified in terms of Plan 
financing and establishment of specialized institutions to promote 
savings and investment in the Indian economy and meet the 
credit requirements of the priority sectors  Two important events 
during the  s   the devaluation of the rupee in June   and 
nationalization of   private commercial banks in July     greatly 
influenced the functions of the Reserve Bank in the subsequent 
years  Externally  the uncertainties in the global economy following 
the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system of stable exchange 
rates and the emergence of the floating regimes exacerbated by 
the oil shock of  -  presented serious challenges for exchange 
rate management and gave rise to balance of payments difficulties 
in India as in many other developing countries  The Government 
re-focused on the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act  FERA   
for conserving foreign exchange rather than regulating the entry 
of foreign capital  The FERA    was drafted incorporating the 
changes necessary for effective implementation of the Government 
policy and removing the difficulties in the working of the existing 
legislation  The major responsibilities devolving on the Reserve 
Bank during the  s related to regulation and management of 
the country s scarce foreign exchange reserves and expansion in the 
volume and scope of its refinance facilities for agriculture and rural 
development  During the  s  monetary policy assumed a new 
focus  On the whole  the development phase was characterized by a 
plethora of controls and regulations in the Indian economy 
c   
Reform Phase   Onwards  The process of liberalization and 
globalization the Indian economy initiated since   added several 
new dimensions to the responsibilities of the Reserve Bank  Along 
with financial sector reforms  the monetary policy framework has 
been fine-tuned and the conventional central banking functions 
including those of currency management and payment and 
settlement systems have been revamped in tandem with the global 
trends and domestic expediency  The reform measures in the 
financial sector and the initiatives taken by the Reserve Bank for 
developing financial markets to ensure efficient transmission of 
monetary policy impulses  constituted the hallmark of this phase 
The first phase of reforms  guided by the recommendations of the 
 Notes 
Committee on Financial System  Narasimham Committee I  aimed 
at enhancing the operational flexibility and functional autonomy of 
the financial sector with a view to fostering efficiency  productivity 
and profitability  The second phase  based on the recommendations 
of the Committee on Banking Sector Reforms  Narasimham 
Committee II  focused on strengthening the foundations of the 
banking system and bringing about structural improvements

notes particularly in the lower denominations 
For example  RBI is considering issues of   banknotes in polymer 
  Banker and Debt Manager to Government 
Managing the government s banking transactions is a key RBI role 
Like individuals  businesses and banks  governments need a banker to 
carry out their financial transactions in an efficient and effective manner 
including the raising of resources from the public  As a banker to the 
central government  the Reserve Bank maintains its accounts  receives 
money into and makes payments out of these accounts and facilitates the 
transfer of government funds  RBI also acts as the banker to those state 
governments that have entered into an agreement with it 
The role as banker and debt manager to government includes 
several distinct functions 
     
Undertaking banking transactions for the central and state 
 Notes 
governments to facilitate receipts and payments and maintaining 
their accounts 
     
Managing the governments  domestic debt with the objective of 
raising the required amount of public debt in a cost-effective and 
timely manner 
     
Developing the market for government securities to enable the 
government to raise debt at a reasonable cost  provide benchmarks 
for raising resources by other entities and facilitate transmission of 
monetary policy actions 
At the end of each day  our electronic system automatically 
consolidates all of the government s transactions to determine the net 
final position  If the balance in the government s account shows a negative 
position  RBI extends a short-term  interest-bearing advance  called a 
Ways and Means Advance - WMA   the limit or amount for which is set at 
the beginning of each financial year in April 
The RBI s Government Finance Operating Structure 
The RBI s Department of Government and Bank Accounts oversees 
governments  banking related activities  This department encompasses 
     
Public accounts departments  manage the day-to-day aspects 
of our Government s banking operations  The Reserve Bank also 
appoints commercial banks as its agents and uses their branches for 
greater access to the government s customers 
     
Public debt offices  provide depository services for government 
securities for institutions and service government loans

government securities market  RBI plans to enhance efficient and user- 
friendly conduct of banking transactions for central and state governments 
while ensuring cost-effective cash and debt management by deepening 
and widening of the market for government securities 
 Notes

and determine the operational aspects of raising money to help the 
government finance its requirements 
     
Determine the size  tenure and nature  fixed or floating rate  of the 
loan 
     
Define the issuing process including holding of auctions

process to increase investor confidence  with the objective of broadening 
and deepening the government securities market 
  Banker to Banks 
Like individual consumers  businesses and organizations of all 
kinds  banks need their own mechanism to transfer funds and settle inter- 
bank transactions - such as borrowing from and lending to other banks 
  and customer transactions 
As the banker to banks  the Reserve Bank fulfills this role  In effect 
all banks operating in the country have accounts with the Reserve Bank 
just as individuals and businesses have accounts with their banks 
As the banker to banks  RBI focuses on 
     
Enabling smooth  swift and seamless clearing and settlement of 
inter-bank obligations 
     
Providing an efficient means of funds transfer for banks 
     
Enabling banks to maintain their accounts with us for purpose of 
statutory reserve requirements and maintain transaction balances 
     
Acting as lender of the last resort 
 Notes 
The RBI provides similar products and services for the nation s 
banks to what banks offer their own customers  Here s a look at how RBI 
helps 
     
Non-interest earning current accounts  Banks hold accounts 
with the RBI based on certain terms and conditions  such as 
maintenance of minimum balances  They can hold accounts at each 
of our regional offices  Banks draw on these accounts to settle their 
obligations arising from inter-bank settlement systems  Banks can 
electronically transfer payments to other banks from this account 
using the Real Time Gross Settlement System  RTGS 
     
Deposit Account Department  This department s computerized 
central monitoring system helps banks manage their funds position 
in real time to maintain the optimum balance between surplus and 
deficit centres 
     
Remittance facilities  Banks and government departments can use 
these facilities to transfer funds 
     
Lender of the last resort  The Reserve Bank provides liquidity to 
banks unable to raise short-term liquid resources from the inter- 
bank market  Like other central banks  the Reserve Bank considers 
this a critical function because it protects the interests of depositors 
which in turn  has a stabilizing impact on the financial system and 
on the economy as a whole 
     
Loans and advances  The Reserve Bank provides short-term loans 
and advances to banks   financial institutions  when necessary  to 
facilitate lending for specified purposes 
RBI is planning to implement core banking solutions for its 
customers to enhance the safety and efficiency of the payments and 
settlement services in the country 
  Regulator of the Banking System 
Banks are fundamental to the nation s financial system  The central 
bank has a critical role to play in ensuring the safety and soundness of 
the banking system and in maintaining financial stability and public 
confidence in this system  As the regulator and supervisor of the banking 
 Notes 
system  the RBI protects the interests of depositors  ensures a framework 
for orderly development and conduct of banking operations conducive 
to customer interests and maintains overall financial stability through 
preventive and corrective measures 
The Reserve Bank regulates and supervises the nation s financial 
system  Different departments of the Reserve Bank oversee the various 
entities that comprise India s financial infrastructure  RBI oversees 
     
Commercial banks and all-India development financial 
institutions  Regulated by the Department of Banking Operations 
and Development  supervised by the Department of Banking 
Supervision

The Reserve Bank makes use of several supervisory tools such as 
on-site inspections  Off-site surveillance  making use of required reporting 
by the regulated entities  and thematic inspections  scrutiny and periodic 
meetings  The Board for Financial Supervision oversees the Reserve Bank s 
regulatory and supervisory responsibilities

Regulating interest rates in specific areas 
     
Setting appropriate regulatory norms related to income recognition 
asset classification  provisioning  investment valuation  exposure 
limits and the like 
     
Initiating new regulation 
In the regulatory and supervisory arena  there are several challenges 
going forward 
a  For commercial banks  Focus is on implementing Basel II norms 
which will require improved capital planning and risk management 
skills 
b  For urban cooperative banks  Focus is on profitability  professional 
management and technology enhancement 
c  For NBFCs  Focus is on identifying the interconnections and the 
roles these institutions should play as the financial system deepens

minimum prudential standards 
  Manager of Foreign Exchange 
With the transition to a market-based system for determining 
the external value of the Indian rupee  the foreign exchange market in 
India gained importance in the early reform period  In recent years  with 
increasing integration of the Indian economy with the global economy 
arising from greater trade and capital flows  the foreign exchange market 
has evolved as a key segment of the Indian financial market 
The Reserve Bank plays a key role in the regulation and development 
of the foreign exchange market and assumes three broad roles relating to 
foreign exchange 
     
Regulating transactions related to the external sector and facilitating 
the development of the foreign exchange market 
 Notes 
     
Ensuring smooth conduct and orderly conditions in the domestic 
foreign exchange market 
     
Managing the foreign currency assets and gold reserves of the 
country 
The Reserve Bank is responsible for administration of the Foreign 
Exchange Management Act    and regulates the market by issuing 
licences to banks and other select institutions to act as Authorized 
Dealers in foreign exchange  The Foreign Exchange Department  FED  is 
responsible for the regulation and development of the market  On a given 
day  the foreign exchange rate reflects the demand for and supply of foreign 
exchange arising from trade and capital transactions  The RBI s Financial 
Markets Department  FMD  participates in the foreign exchange market 
by undertaking sales   purchases of foreign currency to ease volatility in 
periods of excess demand for supply of foreign currency 
The Department of External Investments and Operations  DEIO 
invests the country s foreign exchange reserves built up by purchase of 
foreign currency from the market  In investing its foreign assets  the 
Reserve Bank is guided by three principles  safety  liquidity and return 
The challenge for RBI is to liberalize and develop the foreign 
exchange market  with an eye toward ushering in greater market efficiency 
while ensuring financial stability in an increasingly global financial market 
environment  With current account convertibility achieved in   the 
key focus is now on capital account management 
  Regulator and Supervisor of Payment and Settlement Systems 
Payment and settlement systems play an important role in improving 
overall economic efficiency  They consist of all the diverse arrangements 
that we use to systematically transfer money - currency  paper instruments 
such as cheques  and various electronic channels 
The Payment and Settlement Systems Act of    PSS Act  gives 
the Reserve Bank oversight authority  including regulation and supervision 
for the payment and settlement systems in the country  In this role  RBI 
focuses on the development and functioning of safe  secure and efficient 
payment and settlement mechanisms 
 Notes 
The Reserve Bank has a two-tiered structure  The first tier provides 
the basic framework for our payment systems  The second tier focuses 
on supervision of this framework  As part of the basic framework  the 
RBI s network of secure systems handles various types of payment and 
settlement activities 
Most operate on the security platform of the Indian Financial 
Network  INFINET  using digital signatures for further security of 
transactions  Here is an overview of the various systems used 
a  Retail payment systems  Facilitating cheques clearing  electronic 
funds transfer  through National Electronic Funds Transfer 
 NEFT  settlement of card payments and bulk payments  such as 
electronic clearing services  Operated through local clearing houses 
throughout the country 
b  Large value systems  Facilitating settlement of inter-bank 
transactions from financial markets  These include 
     
Real Time Gross Settlement System  RTGS  for funds transfers 
     
Securities Settlement System  for the government securities 
market 
     
Foreign Exchange Clearing  for transactions involving foreign 
currency 
c  Department of Payment and Settlement Systems  The Reserve 
Bank s payment and settlement systems regulatory arm 
d  Department of Information Technology  Tech support for the 
payment systems and for the Reserve Bank s internal IT systems 
RBI is proactively identifying and addressing issues that help 
mitigate the risks for large value systems  Efforts on the retail payment 
system side will focus on operational efficiencies  cost effectiveness 
innovation and risk management 
  Developmental Role 
This role is  perhaps  the most unheralded aspect of our activities 
yet it remains among the most critical  This includes ensuring that credit is 
available to the productive sectors of the economy  establishing institutions 
designed to build the country s financial infrastructure  expanding access 
 Notes 
to affordable financial services and promoting financial education and 
literacy 
Over the years  the Reserve Bank has added new institutions as 
the economy has evolved  Some of the institutions established by the RBI 
include 
     
Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation   to 
provide protection to bank depositors and guarantee cover to credit 
facilities extended to certain categories of small borrowers 
     
Unit Trust of India   the first mutual fund of the country 
     
Industrial Development Bank of India   a development 
finance institution for industry 
     
National Bank of Agriculture and Rural Development   for 
promoting rural and agricultural credit 
     
Discount and Finance House of India   a money market 
intermediary and a primary dealer in government securities 
     
National Housing Bank   an apex financial institution for 
promoting and regulating housing finance 
     
Securities and Trading Corporation of India   a primary 
dealer 
The Reserve Bank continues its developmental role  while 
specifically focusing on financial inclusion  Key tools in this on-going 
effort include 
a  Directed credit for lending to priority sector and weaker sections 
The goal here is to facilitate enhance credit flow to employment 
intensive sectors such as agriculture  micro and small enterprises 
 MSE  as well as for affordable housing and education loans 
b  Lead Bank Scheme  A commercial bank is designated as a lead 
bank in each district in the country and this bank is responsible for 
ensuring banking development in the district through coordinated 
efforts between banks and government officials  The Reserve Bank 
has assigned a Lead District Manager for each district who acts 
 Notes 
as a catalytic force for promoting financial inclusion and smooth 
working between government and banks 
c  Sector specific refinance  The Reserve Bank makes available 
refinance to banks against their credit to the export sector  In 
exceptional circumstances  it can provide refinance against lending 
to other sectors 
d  Strengthening and supporting small local banks  This includes 
regional rural banks and cooperative banks 
e  Financial inclusion  Expanding access to finance and promoting 
financial literacy are a part of our outreach efforts 
The development role of the Reserve Bank will continue to evolve 
along with the Indian economy  Through the outreach efforts and emphasis 
on customer service  the Reserve Bank will continue to make efforts to fill 
the gaps to promote inclusive economic growth and stability 
Financial Inclusion and Literacy 
Expanding Access   Encouraging Education 
Expanding access to and knowledge about finance is a fundamental 
aspect of the Reserve Bank s operations  These efforts are critical to 
ensuring that the benefits of a growing and healthy economy reach all 
segments of the population  RBI s work here includes 
     
Encouraging provision of affordable financial services like zero- 
balance  no-frills bank accounts  access to payments and remittance 
facilities  savings  loans and insurance services 
     
Expanding banking outreach through use of technology  such as 
banking by cell phone  smartcards and the like 
     
Encouraging bank branch expansion in parts of the country with 
few banking facilities 
     
Facilitating use of specified persons to act as agents to perform 
banking functions in hard-to reach parts of the country 
RBI s effort to promote financial literacy focuses on educating 
people about responsible financial management  Efforts here include 
 Notes 
a  Information and knowledge-sharing  User-friendly website 
includes easy-to-understand tips and guidance in multiple languages 
brochures  advertisements and other marketing materials educate 
the public about banking services 
b  Credit counseling  The Reserve Bank encourages commercial 
banks to set up financial literacy and credit counseling centres  to 
help people develop better financial planning skills

Monetary Policy in India 
Objectives and Framework of Monetary Policy 
In India  the objectives of monetary policy evolved for maintaining 
price stability and ensuring adequate flow of credit to the productive 
sectors of the economy  With progressive liberalization and increasing 
globalization of the economy  maintaining orderly conditions in the 
financial markets emerged as an additional policy objective  Thus 
monetary policy in India endeavours to maintain a judicious balance 
between 
     
Price stability 
     
Economic growth 
     
Financial stability 
The case of price stability as the prime objective of monetary policy 
rests on the assumption that volatility in prices creates uncertainty in 
economic decision making  Rising prices affect savings adversely while 
they make speculative investments more attractive  The most important 
contribution of the financial system to an economy is its ability to augment 
savings and allocate resources more efficiently  A regime of rising prices 
thus  clearly affects the atmosphere for promotion of savings and allocation 
of investment  Furthermore  the domestic inflation rate also has a bearing 
on the exchange rate of the currency 
 Notes 
Operating Procedures of Monetary Policy in India 
Operating procedure refer to the day to day management of 
monetary conditions consistent with the overall stance of monetary policy 
It is in essence the  nuts and bolts  of monetary policy  It involves four 
activities  viz 
     
The choice of the operational target 
     
The nature  extent and the frequency of different money market 
operations by the central bank 
     
The use and width of the corridor for very short-term market 
interest rates  and 
     
The manner of signaling policy intentions 
The operating procedure is explained in detail below 
  Issues and Options  The liquidity adjustment facility  LAF  has 
emerged as the key element of the present operating procedure 
of monetary policy  It has generally helped in steering the desired 
trajectory of interest rates in response to evolving market conditions 
  Monetary Transmission  At the heart of the operating framework 
is the nature of monetary transmission  The pertinent question 
is whether the interest rate channel of monetary transmission is 
working  Monetary transmission is substantially more effective in a 
deficit liquidity situation than in a surplus liquidity situation 
  Policy Rate  The present LAF framework is such that the operating 
policy rate alternates between the repo rate and the reverse repo 
rate  depending on the prevailing liquidity condition  In a surplus 
liquidity condition  the reverse repo rate becomes the operating 
policy rate  In a deficit liquidity situation  the repo rate becomes 
the policy rate  Going by international best practices  it is 
unconventional to have two policy rates 
  Bank Rate  The RBI in its tool kit has the Bank Rate which is 
essentially a discount rate  Under Section   of the RBI of India Act 
the Bank Rate has been defined as  the standard rate at which it  the 
Reserve Bank  is prepared to buy or re-discount bills of exchange or 
other commercial paper eligible for purchase under this Act  While 
 Notes 
the Bank Rate was an important instrument of monetary control 
its importance declined once the LAF system was instituted and 
progressively refinance facilities were provided at the repo rate  It is 
now used for calculating penalty on default in the cash reserve ratio 
 CRR  and the statutory liquidity ratio  SLR  as required by the RBI 
Act and BR Act 
  Constituents of the Corridor  The prescription of the Bank Rate by 
itself will not make it active unless there is liquidity facilities linked 
to the Bank Rate  It is recommended to have the institution of a 
collateralized Exceptional Standing Facility  ESF  at the Bank Rate 
up to one per cent of the Net Demand and Time Liabilities  NDTL 
of banks carved out of their required SLR portfolio  This facility is 
not entirely new  In the recent episode of liquidity tightness  the 
RBI has been providing additional liquidity up to   to   per cent 
of NDTL but on an ad hoc basis at the repo rate  The advantages 
of this facility are four-fold  First  it will provide an upper bound 
to the policy rate corridor  Second  it will provide a safety valve 
against unanticipated liquidity shocks  Third  it will help stabilize 
the overnight interest rate around the repo rate in a liquidity deficit 
situation  Fourth  it will enhance the liquidity attribute of the SLR 
portfolio without compromising its prudential nature 
  Width of the Corridor  First  it should not be so wide as to induce 
volatility in short-term money market rates  Second  it should not be 
so narrow that it retards the development of the short-term money 
market by taking away the incentive from market participants to 
deal among themselves before approaching the central bank 
  Operating Target  The overnight call money rate has been the 
operating target of monetary policy as the monetary transmission 
is the fastest to this segment  However  in the past few years  the 
turnover in the uncollateralized  inter-bank money market  segment 
has declined sharply  while that in the overnight collateralized 
market segment  viz  the Collateralized Borrowing and Lending 
Obligations  CBLO  and market repo  has increased  The prudential 
limits as prescribed by the RBI have not constrained the growth 
of the call money market  rather it has increased the stability of 
the money market with an increasing share of the collateralized 
segment 
 Notes 
  Timing and Frequency of LAF  The RBI is currently conducting 
LAF twice a day  This has provided flexibility to market participants 
and has helped contain volatility in the overnight market 
  Instruments for Liquidity Management  In order to keep the 
liquidity in the LAF window at the optimal level of  -  one per 
cent of NDTL for effective monetary transmission  the RBI needs 
to have instruments at its disposal to manage excessive liquidity 
deficit surplus conditions  The role of the LAF window is to deal 
with frictional liquidity deficit surplus  Liquidity of a more durable 
nature needs to be managed with other instruments 
  Collateral  The RBI holds Special Bonds  oil bonds  apart from 
government securities  in its portfolio  Oil bonds are treated as 
non-SLR securities  With effect from July     government 
securities obtained under reverse repo are not reckoned for the 
purpose of SLR of banks 
  Liquidity Forecast  To ensure that the operating target does not 
deviate from the policy rate  liquidity forecast plays a crucial 
role  Liquidity forecast in the RBI is made on a weekly basis up to 
four weeks ahead  A quick back-testing analysis of these liquidity 
forecasts shows that the liquidity projections during the past two 
years have been satisfactory  The one-week-ahead forecasts show a 
relatively lower margin of error compared with the forecasts for the 
subsequent weeks  However  the discrepancy in liquidity forecast 
has increased  reflecting large swings in government cash balances 
  Dissemination of Liquidity Forecast  Several central banks 
disseminate liquidity forecasts  such as the ECB  weekly  Bank of 
England  daily  Bank of Japan  daily and monthly  Bank of Canada 
 daily  and Reserve Bank of Australia  daily  The dissemination of 
forecasts is intended primarily to facilitate the liquidity management 
of banks  However  following the global financial crisis  some 
advanced countries have stopped disseminating information on 
liquidity forecasts  such as the US Federal Reserve  Bank of England 
 suspended since August  and Swiss National Bank and among 
EMEs  Brazil and the Bank of Korea  While the dissemination of 
forecasts helps market participants to make better assessments on 
the factors affecting liquidity and on the possible direction and 
 Notes 
quantum of central bank intervention  any inaccurate assessments 
may increase uncertainty in financial markets  At present  the RBI 
publishes the information on banks  cash balances with the RBI 
with a lag of three days 
  Maintenance of the CRR  An area of uncertainty in liquidity forecast 
is the pattern of CRR maintenance by banks  At present  banks  on 
average  are required to maintain   per cent of the required CRR 
during the fortnight with a daily minimum maintenance of   per 
cent  However  banks frontload their CRR balances with the RBI 
in the first week of the reporting Friday  the front loading being 
higher in deficit liquidity situations  This accentuates the liquidity 
stress  But at the system level  banks tend to maintain over   per 
cent of their required balance throughout the maintenance period 
  Seamless Movements of Funds and Securities  Interest rate in the 
uncollateralized segment is expected to be higher than that in the 
collateralized segment due to the credit risk involved in the former 
However  interest rates in the overnight inter-bank call money 
market deviate from the operating policy rate significantly even if 
the interest rate in the collateralized segments  i e  the CBLO and 
market repo  remains close to the operating policy rate  There are 
two reasons for this 
a   Difficulty in providing sufficient collateral by some banks 
b   S ettlement of securities and funds under different segments 
occurring at different times  necessitating the use of intra-day 
liquidity or the need for additional securities 
Changes in Operating Procedure of Monetary Policy in India 
Consistent with the objectives and policy framework  the operating 
procedure of monetary policy in India has also witnessed significant 
changes  The choice of targets  instruments and operating procedure was 
circumscribed to a large extent by the nature of the financial markets and 
the institutional arrangements 
     
During the monetary targeting period  -  while M 
growth provided the nominal anchor  reserve money was used as 
 Notes 
the operating target and cash reserve ratio  CRR  was used as the 
principal operating instrument 
     
Besides CRR  in the pre-reform period prior to   given the 
command and control nature of the economy  the Reserve Bank 
had to resort to direct instruments like interest rate regulations and 
selective credit control  These instruments were used intermittently 
to neutralize the expansionary impact of large fiscal deficits which 
were partly monetized 
     
The administered interest rate regime kept the yield rate of the 
government securities artificially low  The demand for them was 
created through periodic hikes in the Statutory Liquidity Ratio 
 SLR  for banks  The year  -  was a landmark in the sense 
that the market borrowing programme of the government was 
put through the auction process  This was supported by a phased 
deregulation of lending rates in the credit market 
     
The Reserve Bank also brought down the SLR and CRR drastically 
All these developments resulted in a decline in pre-emption of 
resources from the banking 
     
The Narsimham Committee   however  noted that the 
money market continued to remain lopsided  thin and volatile and 
the Reserve Bank also had no effective presence in the market 
Therefore  it reiterated the need to transform the call money market 
into a pure inter-bank market and recommended the Reserve Bank s 
operations to be market-based 
     
Following these recommendations  the Reserve Bank introduced 
the Liquidity Adjustment Facility  LAF  in June   to manage 
market liquidity on a daily basis and also to transmit interest rate 
signals to the market  Under the LAF  the Reserve Bank s policy 
reverse repo and repo rates set the corridor for overnight market 
interest rates  Thus  Open Market Operations  OMSs  including 
LAF emerged as the dominant instrument of monetary policy 
though CRR continued to be used as an additional instrument of 
policy 
     
The call money market was transformed into a pure inter-bank 
market by August   in a phased manner 
 Notes 
     
Concomitantly  to enable a smooth exit of non-banks  new 
instruments such as the CBLO were introduced in January  
     
With the introduction of prudential limits on borrowing and lending 
by banks in the call money market  the collateralized money market 
segments developed rapidly 
     
Maturities of other money market instruments such as commercial 
papers  CPs  and certificates of deposits  CDs  were gradually 
shortened to seven days in order to align the maturity structure 
     
Managing large and persistent capital inflows in excess of the 
absorptive capacity of the economy added another dimension to 
the liquidity management operations during the  s  Although 
initially the liquidity impact of large capital inflows were sterilized 
through OMOs and LAF operations  given the finite stock of 
government securities in the Reserve Bank s portfolio and the legal 
restrictions on issuance of its own paper  additional instruments 
were needed to contain liquidity of a more enduring nature 
     
This led to the introduction of the Market Stabilization Scheme 
 MSS  in April   Under this scheme  short-term government 
securities were issued but the amount remained impounded in the 
Reserve Bank s balance sheet for sterilization purposes 
     
Interestingly  in the face of reversal of capital flows during the 
recent crisis  unwinding of such sterilized liquidity under the MSS 
helped to ease liquidity conditions 
     
In response to the measures taken to develop the money market 
over the years the turnover in various market segments increased 
significantly 
     
All these reforms have also led to improvement in liquidity 
management operations by the Reserve Bank as evident from the 
stability in call money rates  which also helped improve integration of 
various money market segments and thereby effective transmission 
of policy signals 
     
The rule-based fiscal policy pursued under the Fiscal Responsibility 
and Budget Management  FRBM  Act  by easing fiscal dominance 
contributed to overall improvement in monetary management 
 Notes 
     
Notwithstanding such improvements at the short-end of the 
financial market spectrum  the transmission of the policy signals 
to banks  lending rates has been rather slow given the rigidities 
in the system  particularly the preference for fixed interest rate 
on term deposits  Against the backdrop of ample liquidity in the 
system more recently  as banks have reduced their deposit rates  the 
effective lending rates would have shown further moderation 
Monetary Policy Formulation Processes 
The process of monetary policy in India had traditionally been 
largely internal with only the end product of actions being made public 
The process includes a wide range of inputs involving the internal staff 
market participants  academics  financial market experts and the Bank s 
Board  At the apex of the policy process is the Governor  assisted closely by 
Deputy Governors and guided by deliberations of the Board of Directors 
A Committee of the Board meets every week to review the monetary 
economic and financial conditions and renders advice on policy  There 
are several other standing and ad hoc committees or groups which play a 
critical role with regard to policy advice  An interdepartmental Financial 
Markets Committee focuses on day-to-day market operations and tactics 
while periodic monetary policy strategy meetings analyze strategies on an 
ongoing basis 
Methods of Credit Controls 
Since the  s  the Reserve Bank faced the twin problems of 
making provisions for financing economic growth and ensuring price 
stability in the wake of a sharp increase in money supply emanating from 
the rapid expansion in credit  The increased public expenditure and the 
coincident rise in banks deposits began to place a greater pressure on 
the effectiveness of monetary policy  The Reserve Bank had to adopt a 
balancing approach to handle this knife-edged problem and resorted to 
the policy of a  controlled expansion  of credit to meet the twin objectives 
of making provision of credit for attaining faster rate of economic growth 
and ensuring price stability 
 Notes 
Quantitative Methods of Credit Control 
The Quantitative measures of credit control include the following 
Bank Rate Policy 
The bank rate is the official interest rate at which RBI rediscounts 
the approved bills held by commercial banks  For controlling the credit 
inflation and money supply  RBI will increase the Bank Rate  If the bank 
rate is increased  the commercial banks will have to pay a higher rate of 
interest for their borrowings from RBI  In turn  commercial banks will 
charge higher interest rate when they grant loans to their customers  Thus 
the borrowers will be discouraged to borrow  The trading and business 
activities will be reduced  The reduced money supply and price level in 
turn is brought down 
Open Market Operations 
OMO-The Open Market Operations refer to direct sales and 
purchase of securities and bills in the open market by RBI  The aim is to 
control volume of credit  By selling in the money market  the RBI tries to 
absorb the excess money supply with the commercial banks  insurance 
companies and financial institutions  During inflation  the sale of security 
by RBI will encourage commercial banks to buy  In this process  the surplus 
cash with the commercial banks are left with fewer amounts of funds  they 
cannot lend more and so borrowers will find it difficult to obtain loan 
This will bring down the economic activities and there by the income 
Variable Reserve Ratios and Rate 
a  Cash Reserve ratio  Cash Reserve ratio refers to that portion of total 
deposits in commercial banks which it has to keep with RBI as cash 
reserves  If CRR is reduced  the banks will be able to give more loans 
Increased lending by banks will lead to more economic activities 
During inflation  the CRR will be increased and this will leave the 
bank to lend only less 
b  Statutory Liquidity Ratio  It refers to that portion of deposits 
with the banks which it has to keep with itself as liquid assets  old 
 Notes 
approved government securities  etc  This ratio helps the RBI to 
control money supply with the banks 
c  Repo rate  Repo rate is a rate at which banks borrow rupees from 
RBI against approved securities to fulfill short term gap 
d  Reverse Repo rate  Reverse Repo rate is rate at which RBI would 
borrow money from banks 
If RBI wishes to control credit and discourage credit it would 
increase CRR   SLR 
Qualitative Methods of Credit Control 
Qualitative credit control is used by the RBI for selective purposes 
Some of them are 
  Margin requirements  This refers to difference between the 
securities offered and amount borrowed by the banks  The RBI will 
prescribe the percentage of margin a bank should maintain while 
granting loan  During the inflation  the RBI will increase the margin 
leaving lesser amount of cash at the disposal of the borrower  This 
will affect their borrowing capacity and there by demand for other 
goods  During depression  the margin will be reduced 
  Consumer Credit Regulations  This refers to issuing rules 
regarding down payments and maximum maturities of installment 
credit for purchase of goods  Based on the scenario  inflation or 
depression  the RBI will increase or decrease the down payment or 
any other rules 
  Control of Bank Advances  The RBI may instruct the banks not to 
lend for undesirable and unproductive purposes and direct credit 
only for productive purposes  By this way  the RBI controls bank 
advances 
  RBI Guidelines  RBI issues oral  written statements  appeals 
guidelines  warnings  etc  to the banks 
  Rationing of credit  The RBI controls the credit granted allocated 
by commercial banks  Credit rationing is a method by which the 
distribution of credit is done according to the conditions of the 
 Notes 
national economy  If there is more demand in one sector  say 
agriculture  then the RBI may fix certain percentage of loanable 
funds for that sector individually and in relation to total advances 
  Moral Suasion  It refers to psychological means and informal 
means of selective credit control  A request will be made by RBI 
to banks to cooperate with its policies  For this method  the RBI 
should have a cordial relationship with banks 
  Direct Action  This step is taken by the RBI against banks that 
do not fulfill conditions and requirements  RBI may refuse to 
rediscount their papers or may give excess credits or charge a penal 
rate of interest over and above the Bank rate  for credit demanded 
beyond a limit 
Autonomy of Central Bank Systems 
Areas of Central Bank Independence 
Central bank independence generally relates to three areas viz 
personnel matters  financial aspects  and conduct of policy 
 i  Personnel independence refers to the extent to which the 
Government distances itself from appointment  term of office and 
dismissal procedures of top central bank officials and the governing 
board  It also includes the extent and nature of representation of 
the Government in the governing body of the central bank 
 ii  Financial independence relates to the freedom of the central bank 
to decide the extent to which Government expenditure is either 
directly or indirectly financed via central bank credits  Direct or 
automatic access of Government to central bank credits would 
naturally imply that monetary policy is subordinated to fiscal 
policy 
 iii  Policy independence is related to the flexibility given to the 
central bank in the formulation and execution of monetary policy 
Recent literature has stressed the difference between goal 
independence and instrument independence 
 Notes 
 iv  Goal independence refers to a situation where the central bank 
itself can choose the policy priorities of stabilizing output or prices 
at any given point of time  thus setting the goal of monetary policy 
 v 
Instrument independence implies that the central bank is only 
free to choose the means to achieve the objective set by the 
Government 
Evolving Relationship with the Government and RBI - A Review 
Rangarajan  Then RBI Governor  defined the independence of central 
banks as  the institutional arrangements for the conduct of monetary policy 
and condemned the practice of automatic monetization of the Government s 
fiscal deficit through the issue of ad hoc treasury bills as the principal factor 
impinging on the effective conduct of monetary policy in the Indian context 
The evolving relationship between the Government and the RBI 
can be broadly divided in to four distinct phases 
First Phase 
During this phase  which may be called infancy and uncertainty 
the RBI was virtually subservient to the dictates of the Government and 
measures were taken to curb its capacity for independent actions  The 
fact that the rate of inflation was modest compared to other developing 
countries during this period is indicative of the success of macro- 
policy management and facilitated the task of the RBI in pursuing other 
developmental activities 
Second Phase 
During this period  the RBI was vigorously involved in promoting 
the institutionalization of credit to agriculture and industry in pursuant to 
the overall objectives of the respective Five-Year Plans  Another important 
objective of the RBI was the promotion and mobilization of savings by 
reinforcing the foundations of the banking system  This  however  does 
not mean that differences between the RBI and the Government over 
economic policies were totally absent  For example  the RBI did not approve 
of the substitution of financial planning by a kind of  physical planning 
 Notes 
Another major area of discord between the RBI and the Government in 
the late  s related to the financing of the cooperatives and the pattern 
of organization of the lending agencies  Interestingly  during the early 
 s  Governor Iyengar identified four areas of potential conflict 
between the Bank and the central government  These were interest rate 
policy  deficit financing  cooperative credit policies and management 
of substandard banks  This phase  from nationalization of the RBI in  
till nationalization of major commercial banks in   may be considered 
as maturing of the RBI into a full-fledged professionally managed central 
bank  perhaps one of the foremost in developing countries 
Third Phase 
The third phase that changed the contour of this relationship 
started with the nationalization of major banks in   In this regard 
the nationalization of banks and transfer of ownership to Government 
provided a captive market for the government  Simultaneously  recourse 
to the RBI credit was also high  leading to high levels of monetization 
This phase was characterized by several features to indicate considerable 
influence or dominance of Government over the RBI 
Fourth Phase 
During this phase  the relationship between the central bank 
and the Government took a new turn through a welcome development 
in the supplemental agreement between the Government and the RBI 
in September   on the abolition of the ad hoc treasury bills to be 
made effective from April   The measure eliminated the automatic 
monetization of Government deficits and resulted in considerable 
moderation of the monetized deficit in the latter half of the Nineties 
Significant achievements in financial reforms including strengthening 
of the banking supervision capabilities of the RBI have enhanced its 
credibility and instrument independence 
Conclusion 
The efficacy of the emerging operating procedures of monetary 
policy remains a matter of debate  There is very little doubt that the Reserve 
Bank is now able to set an informal corridor through two-way day-to-day 
 Notes 
liquidity management  The pass-through to the credit market  however 
does not appear very effective because of a variety of factors such as the 
overhang of high cost deposits  large non-performing assets and high non- 
operating expenses in the banking system  As a result  real interest rates 
continue to remain high  This underscores the need to further strengthen 
structural measures to impart the necessary flexibility to the interest 
rate structure in the credit markets  The phasing out of ad hoc Treasury 
Bills and the enactment of Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management 
 FRBM  legislation are two important milestones in providing safeguards 
to monetary policy from the consequences of fiscal expansion and ensuring 
better monetary-fiscal co-ordination

Money Market 
Money market means market where money or its equivalent can be 
traded  Money is synonym of liquidity  Money market consists of financial 
institutions and dealers in money or credit who wish to generate liquidity 
It is better known as a place where large institutions and government 
manage their short term cash needs  For generation of liquidity  short 
term borrowing and lending is done by these financial institutions and 
dealers  Money Market is part of financial market where instruments with 
high liquidity and very short term maturities are traded  Due to highly 
liquid nature of securities and their short term maturities  money market 
is treated as a safe place  Hence  money market is a market where short 
term obligations such as treasury bills  commercial papers and bankers 
acceptances are bought and sold 
The money market is a key component of the financial system as it 
is the fulcrum of monetary operations conducted by the central bank in its 
pursuit of monetary policy objectives  It is a market for short-term funds 
with maturity ranging from overnight to one year and includes financial 
instruments that are deemed to be close substitutes of money 
Structure of Money Market 
The structure of money market can be divided into two 
parts  viz  organized and unorganized  Organized structure includes 
 Notes 
     
Reserve bank of India 
     
DFHI  discount and finance house of India 
     
Commercial banks  Public sector banks  SBI   its associates 
Cooperative banks  Private sector banks and Foreign banks 
     
Development bank IDBI  IFCI  ICICI  NABARD  LIC  GIC 
UTI etc 
The unorganized structure include 
     
Indigenous banks 
     
Money lenders 
     
Chits  Nidhis 
     
Co-operative Sector  State and central cooperative banks  Primary 
urban banks  Primary Agri  credit societies  State  Central and 
Primary Land development banks 
Functions of Money Market 
The money market performs three broad functions 
  It provides an equilibrating mechanism for demand and supply of 
short-term funds 
  It enables borrowers and lenders of short term funds to fulfill their 
borrowing and investment requirements at an efficient market 
clearing price 
  It provides an avenue for central bank intervention in influencing 
both quantum and cost of liquidity in the financial system  thereby 
transmitting monetary policy impulses to the real economy 
The objective of monetary management by the central bank is to 
align money market rates with the key policy rate  As excessive money 
market volatility could deliver confusing signals about the stance of 
monetary policy  it is critical to ensure orderly market behaviour  from 
the point of view of both monetary and financial stability  Thus  efficient 
functioning of the money market is important for the effectiveness of 
monetary policy 
 Notes 
Features of Money Market in India 
  It is a market purely for short-term funds or financial assets called 
near money 
  It deals with financial assets having a maturity period less than one 
year only 
  In Money Market  transaction transactions can be done through oral 
communication  relevant document and written communication 
  Transactions have to be conducted without the help of brokers 
  It is not single homogeneous market  it comprises of several sub 
market like call money market  acceptance bill market 
  The players in the money market include commercial banks 
acceptance houses and NBFC  Non-Banking Financial Companies

Let us understand important money market instruments in detail 
a  Treasury Bills  T-Bills 
Treasury Bills  one of the safest money market instruments  are 
short-term borrowing instruments of the Central Government of the 
Country issued through the Central Bank  RBI in India  They are zero risk 
instruments  and hence the returns are not so attractive  It is available both 
in primary market as well as secondary market  It is a promise to pay a said 
sum after a specified period  T-bills are short-term securities that mature 
in one year or less from their issue date  They are issued with three-month 
six-month and one-year maturity periods  The Central Government issues 
T- Bills at a price less than their face value  par value  They are issued 
with a promise to pay full face value on maturity  So  when the T-Bills 
mature  the government pays the holder its face value  The difference 
between the purchase price and the maturity value is the interest income 
earned by the purchaser of the instrument  T-Bills are issued through a 
bidding process at auctions  The bid can be prepared either competitively 
or non-competitively  In the second type of bidding  return required is not 
specified and the one determined at the auction is received on maturity 
 Notes 
Whereas  in case of competitive bidding  the return required on 
maturity is specified in the bid  In case the return specified is too high then 
the T-Bill might not be issued to the bidder  At present  the Government 
of India issues three types of treasury bills through auctions  namely 
 -day   -day and  -day  There are no treasury bills issued by State 
Governments  Treasury bills are available for a minimum amount of  K 
and in its multiples  While  -day T-bills are auctioned every week on 
Wednesdays   -day and  - day T-bills are auctioned every alternate 
week on Wednesdays 
The Reserve Bank of India issues a quarterly calendar of T-bill 
auctions which is available at the Banks  website  It also announces the 
exact dates of auction  the amount to be auctioned and payment dates 
by issuing press releases prior to every auction  Payment by allottees at 
the auction is required to be made by debit to their  custodian s current 
account  T-bills auctions are held on the Negotiated Dealing System 
 NDS  and the members electronically submit their bids on the system 
NDS is an electronic platform for facilitating dealing in Government 
Securities and Money Market Instruments  RBI issues these instruments 
to absorb liquidity from the market by contracting the money supply  In 
banking terms  this is called Reverse Repurchase  Reverse Repo  On the 
other hand  when RBI purchases back these instruments at a specified date 
mentioned at the time of transaction  liquidity is infused in the market 
This is called Repo  Repurchase  transaction 
b  Repurchase Agreements 
Repurchase transactions  called Repo or Reverse Repo are 
transactions or short term loans in which two parties agree to sell and 
repurchase the same security  They are usually used for overnight 
borrowing  Repo Reverse Repo transactions can be done only between the 
parties approved by RBI and in RBI approved securities viz  GOI and State 
Government Securities  T-Bills  PSU Bonds  FI Bonds  Corporate Bonds 
etc  Under repurchase agreement the seller sells specified securities with 
an agreement to repurchase the same at a mutually decided future date 
and price  Similarly  the buyer purchases the securities with an agreement 
to resell the same to the seller on an agreed date at a predetermined price 
Such a transaction is called a Repo when viewed from the perspective of the 
seller of the securities and Reverse Repo when viewed from the perspective 
 Notes 
of the buyer of the securities  Thus  whether a given agreement is termed as 
a Repo or Reverse Repo depends on which party initiated the transaction 
The lender or buyer in a Repo is entitled to receive compensation for use 
of funds provided to the counterparty  Effectively the seller of the security 
borrows money for a period of time  Repo period  at a particular rate of 
interest mutually agreed with the buyer of the security who has lent the 
funds to the seller  The rate of interest agreed upon is called the Repo 
rate  The Repo rate is negotiated by the counterparties independently of 
the coupon rate or rates of the underlying securities and is influenced by 
overall money market conditions 
c  Commercial Papers 
Commercial paper is a low-cost alternative to bank loans  It is a 
short term unsecured promissory note issued by corporate and financial 
institutions at a discounted value on face value  They are usually issued 
with fixed maturity between   to   days and for financing of accounts 
receivables  inventories and meeting short term liabilities  Say  for example 
a company has receivables of     lakh with credit period   months  It will 
not be able to liquidate its receivables before   months  The company 
is in need of funds  It can issue commercial papers  They yield higher 
returns as compared to T-Bills as they are less secure in comparison to 
these bills  however chances of default are almost negligible but are not 
zero risk instruments  Commercial paper being an instrument not backed 
by any collateral  only firms with high quality credit ratings will find 
buyers easily without offering any substantial discounts  They are issued 
by corporate to impart flexibility in raising working capital resources at 
market determined rates  Commercial Papers are actively traded in the 
secondary market since they are issued in the form of promissory notes 
and are freely transferable in demat form 
d  Certificate of Deposit 
It is a short term borrowing more like a bank term deposit account 
It is a promissory note issued by a bank in form of a certificate entitling the 
bearer to receive interest  The certificate bears the maturity date  the fixed 
rate of interest and the value  It can be issued in any denomination  They 
are stamped and transferred by endorsement  Its term generally ranges 
from three months to five years and restricts the holders to withdraw 
 Notes 
funds on demand  However  on payment of certain penalty the money can 
be withdrawn on demand also  The returns on certificate of deposits are 
higher than T-Bills because it assumes higher level of risk  While buying 
Certificate of Deposit  return method should be seen  Returns can be based 
on Annual Percentage Yield  APY  or Annual Percentage Rate  APR 
In APY  interest earned is based on compounded interest calculation 
However  in APR method  simple interest calculation is done to generate 
the return  Accordingly  if the interest is paid annually  equal return is 
generated by both APY and APR methods  However  if interest is paid 
more than once in a year  it is beneficial to opt APY over APR 
e  Bankers Acceptance 
It is a short term credit investment created by a non financial 
firm and guaranteed by a bank to make payment  It is simply a bill of 
exchange drawn by a person and accepted by a bank  It is a buyer s promise 
to pay to the seller a certain specified amount at certain date  The same 
is guaranteed by the banker of the buyer in exchange for a claim on the 
goods as collateral  The person drawing the bill must have a good credit 
rating otherwise the Banker s Acceptance will not be tradable  The most 
common term for these instruments is   days  However  they can vary 
from   days to  days  For corporations  it acts as a negotiable time 
draft for financing imports  exports and other transactions in goods and 
is highly useful when the credit worthiness of the foreign trade party is 
unknown  The seller need not hold it until maturity and can sell off the 
same in secondary market at discount from the face value to liquidate its 
receivables 
f  Commercial Bills 
Purchase and discounting of commercial bills is a way by which 
banks provide funds for working capital required by commerce  trade and 
industry  The financial instrument trading in the bills market is the bill 
of exchange  It is a written instrument containing unconditional order 
signed by the maker  directing to pay a certain amount of money to a 
particular person  or to the bearer of the instrument  It is a negotiable self- 
liquidating instrument with low degree of risk  Its liquidity is exceeded 
only by T-bills  call loans and cash  in that order  The spread between the 
face value of the bill and ready cash paid is the discount rate  Till the bill 
 Notes 
matures  the banks can use the same process of discounting to get ready 
cash  The eligibility criterion is that the bill should arise out of a genuine 
trade transaction and the maturity period should fall within   days from 
the date of discounting 
g  Term Money 
RBI has permitted some of the Financial Institutions like IDBI 
ICICI  IFCI  HBI  SIDBI  NABARD  EXIM-Bank etc  to borrow from the 
market for a period of   months and up to a period of not more than  
months within the stipulated limits  The rate of interest on the term money 
is determined between the parties by mutual negotiation  The investment 
in term money is unsecured and the limits are fixed by RBI  The term 
money is accepted by their institutions at a discounted value  On the due 
date the payment will be equal to the face value of the instrument  which 
for all purpose consists of term deposit receipt 
h  Bank Deposits 
The banks are permitted to keep deposits with other banks for a 
period of   days and above  The rate of interest of such deposits is freely 
determined by the two banks between themselves through negotiations 
These deposits are not reckoned for the purpose of cash reserve ratio  CRR 
requirements  Like the call notice money transactions  the transactions 
relating to the bank deposit is evidenced by way of deposit receipt  These 
deposits are not transferable  but they could be prematurely closed at the 
discretion of the lender 
i  Bankers Acceptance 
A banker s acceptance is a draft against a bank ordering the bank 
to pay some specified amount at a future date  The banker s acceptance is 
very safe security and is used as a money market instrument 
j  Fringe Market 
The fringe market is a disorganized money market  deemed to 
include everything that is outside the scope of the money market  i e 
the institutional money market  The fringe market includes activities like 
 Notes 
the Inter-Corporate Deposit  ICD  market  small scale trade financing 
financing of investments in the stock market  discounting and lending 
against lOUs or promissory notes  etc  The ICDs market is the most visible 
feature of the fringe market  As its name indicates it essentially involves 
short-term borrowing and lending of funds amongst the corporations 
Generally the fringe market exist  wherever the main borrowers and lenders 
of the funds are based  i e  at the location of the industrial  corporate and 
trading establishments  The interest rates at which the funds can be lent in 
the fringe market are generally higher than those operating in the money 
market  The risk level of the fringe market is higher because the people 
who borrow at exorbitant rates are the ones who are most likely to default 
k  Call Money Market 
Call money refers to that transaction which is received or delivered 
by the participants in the call money market and where the funds are 
returnable next day  The call money transactions are also referred to as 
overnight funds  Notice money on the other hand is a transaction where 
the participants will take time to receive or deliver for more than two 
days but generally for a maximum of fourteen days  In both the cases the 
transaction is unsecured  Therefore  as a prudential measure  a counter- 
party exposure limits are listed according to which the lender lends money 
In short  resorting to the call notice money transactions reflect 
temporary mismatch of funds during the short period of one to fourteen 
days  The participants  who have surplus  lend their money to shed the 
mismatch for the relative period  The participants  who are short of funds 
would borrow funds for the relative period  The rate at which the funds 
will be deployed or borrowed will be determined on the basis of the market 
conditions at a given point of time  When the market is highly liquid 
the funds would be easily available where as the funds will be difficult to 
obtain in a tight money market conditions 
The rates are low in an easy money or liquid market and the rates 
would be high in a tight money market  A liquid market may fluctuate 
even overnight due to sudden changes in the financial environment 
change in policy of the central monetary authority or the Government 
or even due to any other external factor which has an implication on 
the financial market  The document by which the call notice money are 
 Notes 
carried out is the call  notice money receipt which is exchanged against 
Banker s Cheque Reserve Bank Cheque  The following day or on a day 
fixed according to the notice  the reversal takes place by repayment from 
the borrower to the lender against return of the call notice money receipt 
duly discharged by the lender 
Capital Market 
Definition of Capital Market 
It is a place where people buy and sell financial instruments be it 
equity or debt  It is a mechanism to facilitate the exchange of financial assets 
The capital market includes primary and secondary markets  Examples of 
secondary markets in India include BSE  NSE which constitute majority 
of the capital market transactions  At international level  we have NYSE 
LSE   TSE  which are the major Stock Exchanges  More details about 
primary and secondary markets are covered in Unit IV 
Significance of Capital Markets 
A well-functioning stock market may help the development process 
in an economy through the following channels 
     
Growth of savings 
     
Efficient allocation of investment resources 
     
Better utilization of the existing resources 
In market economy like India  financial market institutions provide 
the avenue by which long-term savings are mobilized and channeled into 
investments  Confidence of the investors in the market is imperative for the 
growth and development of the market  For any stock market  the market 
Indices is the barometer of its performance and reflects the prevailing 
sentiments of the entire economy  Stock index is created to provide 
investors with the information regarding the average share price in the 
stock market  The ups and downs in the index represent the movement of 
the equity market  These indices need to represent the return obtained by 
typical portfolios in the country  Generally  the stock price of any company 
is vulnerable to three types of news such as Company specific  Industry 
specific and Economy specific  An all-share index includes stocks from all 
 Notes 
the sectors of the economy and thus cancels out the stock and sector specific 
news and events that affect stock prices  law of portfolio diversification 
and reflect the overall performance of the company equity market and the 
news affecting it 
The most important use of an equity market index is as a benchmark 
for a portfolio of stocks  All diversified portfolios  belonging either to retail 
investors or mutual funds  use the common stock index as a yardstick 
for their returns  Indices are useful in modern financial application of 
derivatives 
Capital Market Instruments and Participants 
The capital market is a place where long term funds are 
borrowed and lent  Capital Market Instruments include Equity  Preference 
shares  Debenture  Bonds  ADRs  GDRs and Derivatives  In the equity 
segment  we have equity shares  preference shares  convertible preference 
shares  non-convertible preference shares  etc  In the debt segment  we 
have debentures  zero coupon bonds  deep discount bonds  etc  Section 
  of the Companies Act    permits public limited companies  having 
share capital  to have two kinds of shares namely - equity and preference 
Apart from the traditional securities  we have lot of innovative  eg  Sweat 
equity shares  and hybrid instruments which are coming up in the market 
More details about the equity and debt instruments are covered in Unit IV 
The foreign capital by way of issue of American Depository Receipts and 
Global Depository Receipts are covered in Unit V 
Another market we have is a derivative market  A derivative 
is a financial instrument  whose value depends on the values of basic 
underlying variable  In the sense  derivatives is a financial instrument 
that offers return based on the return of some other underlying asset  i e 
the return is derived from another instrument  For example  derivatives 
that can be structured around any uncertainty  Stock prices are uncertain 
- Lot of forwards  options or futures contracts are based on movements 
in prices of individual stocks or groups of stocks  Prices of commodities 
are uncertain - There are forwards  futures and options on commodities 
Interest rates are uncertain - There are interest rate swaps and futures 
Foreign exchange rates are uncertain - There are exchange rate derivatives 
and Weather is uncertain - There are weather derivatives  and so on 
 Notes 
Financial derivatives are financial instruments whose prices are 
derived from the prices of other financial instruments  Although financial 
derivatives have existed for a considerable period of time  they have become 
a major force in financial markets only since the early  s  In the class 
of equity derivatives  futures and options on stock indices have gained 
more popularity than on individual stocks  especially among institutional 
investors  who are major users of index-linked derivatives  Even small 
investors find these useful due to high correlation of the popular indices 
with various portfolios and ease of use  Derivative contracts have several 
variants  Depending upon the market in which they are traded  derivatives 
are classified as   exchange traded and   over the counter  The most 
common variants are forwards  futures  options and swaps 
Securities market in India has grown exponentially as measured in 
terms of amount raised from the market  number of stock exchanges and 
other intermediaries  the number of listed stocks  market capitalization 
trading volumes and turnover on stock exchanges and investor population 
Along with this  the profiles of the investors  issuers and intermediaries have 
changed significantly  The market has witnessed fundamental institutional 
changes resulting in drastic reduction in transaction costs and significant 
improvements in efficiency  transparency and safety  Indian market is now 
comparable to many developed markets 
History of Indian Capital Market 
The history of the capital market in India dates back to the 
eighteenth century when East India Company securities were traded in 
the country  Until the end of the nineteenth century  securities trading 
were unorganized and the main trading centres were Bombay  now 
Mumbai  and Calcutta  now Kolkata  Of the two  Bombay was the chief 
trading centre wherein bank shares were the major trading stock  During 
the American Civil War  -  Bombay was an important source of 
supply for cotton  Hence  trading activities flourished during the period 
resulting in a boom in share prices  This boom  the first in the history of 
the Indian capital market  lasted for a half a decade  The first joint stock 
company was established on   The bubble burst on July     when 
there was tremendous slump in share prices  Trading was at that time 
limited to a dozen brokers  their trading place was under a banyan tree 
in front of the Town Hall in Bombay  These stockbrokers organized an 
 Notes 
informal association in  -Native Shares and Stock Brokers Association 
Bombay  The stock exchanges in Calcutta and Ahmadabad  also industrial 
and trading centres came up later  The Bombay Stock Exchange was 
recognized in May   under the Bombay Securities Contracts Control 
Act    The capital market was not well organized and developed during 
the British rule because the British government was not interested in the 
economic growth of the country  As a result  many foreign companies 
depended on the London capital market for funds rather than on the 
Indian capital market 
In the post-independence period also  the size of the capital 
market remained small  During the first and second five-year plans  the 
government s emphasis was on the development of the agricultural sector 
and public sector undertakings  The public sector undertakings were 
healthier than the private undertakings in terms of paid-up capital but 
their shares were not listed on the stock exchanges  Moreover  the then 
Controller of Capital Issues  CCI  closely supervised and controlled the 
timing composition  interest rates  pricing  allotment  and floatation costs 
of new issues  These strict regulations de-motivated many companies from 
going public for almost four and a half decades 
In the  s  Century Textiles  Tata Steel  Bombay Dyeing  National 
Rayon  and Kohinoor Mills were the favourite scripts of speculators 
As speculation became rampant  the stock market came to be known as 
Satta Bazaar  Despite speculation  non-payment or defaults were not very 
frequent  The government enacted the Securities Contracts  Regulation 
Act in  It was also characterized by the establishment of a network for 
the development of financial institutions and state financial corporations 
The  s was characterized by wars and droughts in the country which 
led to bearish trends  These trends were aggravated by the ban in   on 
forward trading and badla  technically called contracts for clearing   Badla 
provided a mechanism for carrying forward positions as well as borrowing 
funds 
Financial institutions such as LIC and GIC helped to revive the 
sentiment by emerging as the most important group of investors  The first 
mutual fund of India  the Unit Trust of India  UTI  came into existence in 
  In the  s  badla trading was resumed under the disguised from of 
hand-delivery contracts-A group  This revived the market  However  the 
 Notes 
capital market received another severe setback on July     when the 
government promulgated the Dividend Restriction Ordinance  restricting 
the payment of dividend by companies  This led to a slump in market 
capitalization at the BSE by about   per cent overnight and the stock 
market did not open for nearly a fortnight 
Later the buoyancy in the stock markets when the multinational 
companies  MNCs  were forced to dilute their majority stocks in their 
Indian ventures in favour of the Indian public under FERA    Several 
MNCs opted out of India  One under and twenty-three MNCs offered 
shares were lower than their intrinsic worth  Hence  for the first time  the 
FERA dilution created an equity cult in India  It was the spate of FERA 
issues that gave a real fillip to the Indian stock markets  For the first time 
many investors got an opportunity to invest in the stocks of such MNCs 
as Colgate  and Hindustan Liver Limited  Then  in   a little   known 
entrepreneur  Dhirubhai Ambani  tapped the capital market  The scrip 
reliance textiles  is still a hot favourite and dominates trading at all stock 
exchanges 
The  s witnessed an explosive growth of the securities market 
in India with millions of investors suddenly discovering lucrative 
opportunities  Many investors jumped into the stock markets for the first 
time  The government s liberalisation process initiated during the mid- 
 s  spurred this growth  Participation by small investors  speculation 
defaults ban on badla  and resumption of badla continued  Convertible 
debentures emerged as a popular instrument of resource mobilization 
in the primary market  The introduction of public sector bonds and the 
successful mega issues of Reliance Petrochemicals and Larsen and Toubro 
gave a new lease of life to the primary market  This  in turn  enlarged 
volumes in the secondary market  The decade of the  s was characterized 
by an increase in the number of stock exchanges  listed companies  paid 
up-capital  and market capitalization 
The  s will go down as the most important decade in the 
history of the capital market of India  Liberalisation and globalization 
were the new terms coined and marketed during the decade  The Capital 
Issues  Control  Act    was repealed in May   The decade was 
characterized by a new industrial policy  emergence of SEBI as a regulator 
of capital market  advent of foreign institutional investors  euro-issues  free 
 Notes 
pricing  new trading practices  new stock exchanges  entry of new players 
such as private sector mutual funds and private sector banks  and primary 
market boom and bust  Major capital market scams took place in the 
 s  These shook the capital market and drove away small investors 
from the market  The securities scam of March    involving brokers as 
well as bankers was one of the biggest scams in the history of the capital 
market  In the subsequent years owing to free pricing  many unscrupulous 
promoters  who raised money from the capital market  proved to be fly- 
by-night operators  This led to erosion in the investors  confidence  The M 
S Shoes case  one such scam which took place in March   put a break 
on new issue activity 
The  -  securities scam revealed the inadequacies  of and 
inefficiencies in the financial system  It was the scam  which prompted 
a reform of the equity market  The Indian stock market witnessed a sea 
change in terms of technology and market prices  Technology brought 
radical changes in the trading mechanism  The Bombay Stock Exchange 
was subject to nationwide competition by two new stock exchanges-the 
National Stock Exchange  set up in   and Over the Counter Exchange 
of India  set up in   The National Securities Clearing Corporation 
 NSCC  and National Securities Depository Limited  NSDL  were set up 
in April   and November   respectively from improved clearing 
and settlement and dematerialized trading  The Securities Contracts 
 Regulation  Act    was amended in  -  for introduction of 
options trading  Moreover  rolling settlement was introduced in January 
  for the dematerialized segment of all companies  With automation 
and geographical spread  stock market participation increased 
In the late  s  the Information Technology  IT  scrips were 
dominant on the Indian bourses  These scrips included Infosys  Wipro 
and Satyam  They were a part of the favourite scrips of the period  also 
known as New Economy scrips  along with telecommunications and media 
scrips  The new economy companies are knowledge intensive unlike the 
old economy companies that were asset intensive  The Indian capital 
market entered the twenty-first century with the Ketan Parekh scam  As 
a result of this scam  Badla was discontinued from July   and rolling 
settlement was introduced in all scrips  Trading of futures commenced 
from June   and Internet trading was permitted in February   On 
July     the Unit Trust of India announced suspension of the sale and

to panic on the bourses  The government s decision to privatize oil PSUs

major VSNL took place in early February  
Foreign institutional investors have emerged as major players on 
the Indian bourses  NSE has an upper hand over its reveal BSE in terms 
of volumes not only in the equity markets but also in the derivatives 
market  It has been a long journey for the Indian capital market  Now 
the capital market is organized  fairly integrated  mature  more global 
and modernized  The Indian equity market is one of the best in the world 
in terms of technology  Advances in computer and communications 
technology coming together on Internet are shattering geographic 
boundaries and enlarging the investor class  Internet trading has become a 
global phenomenon  The Indian stock markets are now getting integrated 
with global markets 
Banking Legislations in India 
Evolution of Legislative Regulation of Banking in India 
In the very early phase of commercial banking in India  the 
regulatory framework was somewhat diffused and the Presidency 
Banks were regulated and governed by their Royal Charter  the East 
India Company and the Government of India of that time  Though the 
Company law was introduced in India way back in   it did not apply 
to the banking companies  The banking crisis of   however  had 
revealed several weaknesses in the Indian banking system  such as the low 
proportion of liquid assets of the banks and connected lending practices 
resulting in large-scale bank failures 
The recommendations of the Indian Central Banking Enquiry 
Committee  -  which looked into the issue of bank failures  paved 
the way for legislation for banking regulation in the country  Though 
the RBI  as part of its monetary management mandate  had  from the 
very beginning  been vested with the powers  under the RBI Act   
to regulate the volume and cost of bank credit in the economy through 
the instruments of general credit control  it was not until   that a 
comprehensive enactment  applicable only to the banking sector  came into 
 Notes 
existence  Prior to   the banking companies  in common with other 
companies  were governed by the Indian Companies Act    which 
itself was a comprehensive re-enactment of the earlier company law of 
  This Act  however  contained a few provisions especially applicable 
to banks 
There were also a few ad hoc enactments  such as the Banking 
Companies  Inspection  Ordinance    and the Banking Companies 
 Restriction of Branches  Act    covering specific regulatory aspects 
In this backdrop  in March   a special legislation  called the Banking 
Companies Act    applicable exclusively to the banking companies 
was passed  this Act was renamed as the Banking Regulation Act from 
March   The Act vested in the Reserve Bank the responsibility relating 
to licensing of banks  branch expansion  and liquidity of their assets 
management and methods of working  amalgamation  reconstruction and 
liquidation  Important changes in several provisions of the Act were made 
from time to time  designed to enlarge or amplify the responsibilities of 
the RBI or to impart flexibility to the relative provisions  commensurate 
with the imperatives of the banking sector developments 
It is interesting to note that till March   the Reserve Bank had 
practically no role in relation to the functioning of the urban co-operative 
banks  However  by the enactment of the Banking Laws  Application 
to Co-operative Societies  Act    certain provisions of the Banking 
Regulation Act  regarding the matters relating to banking business  were 
extended to the urban co-operative banks also  Thus  for the first time 
in   the urban co-operative banks too came within the regulatory 
purview of the RBI

Regulation and Supervision 
Regulation and supervision of the financial system has received 
renewed focus in recent years in the context of the phenomenal expansion 
of the financial sector  technology-enabled innovations in financial 
products and deepening of global integration  The strategic importance of 
the banks in the financial system make it imperative for the central bank 
 historically  the lender of the last resort and the supervisor of the banking 
system - to pursue financial stability as an important macroeconomic 
objective  although  in India  there are separate institutions  viz  the SEBI 
and the IRDA  to oversee the functioning of individual segments of the 
financial system 
A number of initiatives have been taken by the Reserve Bank in 
reorienting the supervisory and regulatory framework and aligning it 
 Notes 
with the international best practices  while providing sufficient flexibility 
to the financial institutions to respond to the growing competition and 
taking advantage of the business opportunities unfolded by technological 
advancements 
     
Narasimham Committee II made a range of recommendations for 
improving the vigour of the banking system  capital adequacy  asset 
quality  nonperforming assets  etc  as also for strengthening the 
supervisory systems 
     
The Committee observed that the issue of  autonomous status  for 
the Board for Financial Supervision  BFS  of the Reserve Bank 
should be considered to segregate the regulatory and supervisory 
functions of the apex bank  The Committee made specific 
recommendations to restructure the BFS and to set up a separate 
Board for Financial Regulation and Supervision  BFRS 
     
The committee also highlighted the need for a review of banking 
sector laws  such as  the RBI Act  the Banking Regulation Act 
the Nationalization Act and the State Bank of India Act  The 
recommendations made by the Committee are being progressively 
implemented 
     
Following the recommendations of the Narasimham Committee II 
and more recently in the context of the Basel II Accord  the Reserve 
Bank has taken several measures to strengthen its regulatory and 
supervisory framework with a view to ensuring a sound  efficient 
and vibrant financial system in the country 
     
The measures to contain the level of nonperforming assets 
 NPAs  include the setting up of Debt Recovery Tribunals for 
expeditious adjudication and recovery of debts due to banks and 
financial institutions  LokAdalats  people s courts  and Asset 
Reconstruction Companies and Corporate Debt Restructuring 
 CDR  mechanisms 
     
In order to ensure the functioning of institutions and markets on the 
basis of informed decisions  the Reserve Bank has issued guidelines 
to banks to enhance the level of transparency and disclosures with 
regard to their financial position 
 Notes 
     
Bank regulation is increasingly getting risk based with the 
realization that the traditional supervisory practices were out of 
step with the sophisticated risk management techniques 
     
The International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital 
Standards  A Revised Framework  popularly known as Basel II  has 
brought regulation and risk management to the center stage 
     
Basel II rests on three pillars  minimum capital requirements 
supervisory review process and market discipline  India has 
decided that all the commercial banks would have to be Basel II 
compliant by adopting  at a minimum  the Standardized Approach 
for credit risk and Basic Indicator Approach for operational risk 
under Pillar   As regards the supervisory review process  Pillar 
  the role of supervisors is to evaluate whether or not the banks 
are assessing their capital requirements properly in relation to their 
risks and if necessary the supervisors may intervene to mandate a 
higher capital requirement  As regards Pillar   the Reserve Bank 
has been advising banks to make disclosures in order to enhance 
market discipline 
     
A view has been expressed in certain quarters that the Indian 
regulatory framework should migrate to principles-based regulation 
from the current rules-based approach 
     
The Basel III framework introduces a paradigm shift in capital 
and liquidity standards  which was constructed and agreed to in 
relatively record time  Basel III proposals have two main objectives 
     
To strengthen global capital and liquidity regulations with the 
goal of promoting and a more resilient banking sector 
     
To improve the banking sector ability to absorb shocks arising 
from financial and economic stress  this  in turn  would reduce 
the risk of a spillover from the financial sector to the real 
economy 
     
To achieve these objectives the Basel III proposals are broken down 
into three parts on the basis of the main areas they address  Capital 
reform  including quality and quantity of capital  complete risk 
coverage  leverage ratio and the introduction of capital conservation 
buffers  and a counter cyclical capital buffer  Liquidity reform 
 Notes 
 short term and long term ratios  and other elements relating to 
general improvements to the stability of the financial system 
Conclusion 
The Indian regulatory regime for the banking sector has come a 
long way over the past six decades  The current regulatory dispensation is 
ownership neutral  nondiscriminatory and provides a level playing field 
for the market participants  There is considerable scope for improvements 
in the regulatory systems in India and we have been pursuing a policy 
of constant improvements through a participative and consultative 
approach with market participants  The policy outcomes so far  in terms 
of contribution to growth  price stability  financial stability  efficiency 
and robustness of banking sector have been significant by all standards 
of measurements  but the search of excellence  in the RBI s mission  is an 
unending journey

CASE STUDY 
Commercial Papers   An Innovative Money Market Instrument 
Commercial Paper  CP  is a short-term negotiable money market 
instrument used by Financial Institutions and Corporations to source 
funds from the public  The base rate system which came into force on July  
  in India brought about drastic changes in the Commercial Paper CP 
market in the country  Under this system  banks were not supposed to lend 
below the base rate  Market analysts noted   The introduction of the so- 
called base rate  below which no bank could lend since July   would 
give a leg up to the commercial paper market in India  Corporations and 
Non-Banking Finance Companies  NBFCs  would prefer to utilize the 
CP for short-term funding needs  Under base rate system  the cost of 
commercial paper worked out to be cheaper than the bank borrowing rate 
as the borrowers were no longer in a position to negotiate on the lending 
rate with banks  The banking system had earlier been using the Prime 
Lending Rate  PLR  for the best rated customers  Borrowers often took 
undue advantage of the system and took loans for short-term periods at 
a minimal rate of interest  This led to a situation where the banks were 
forced to quote competitive  lower rates of interest to retain customers 
This posed a serious threat to the profitability of the banks  Subsequently 
RBI introduced the  Benchmark Prime Lending Rate System   BPLR 
in place of PLR  It made banks quote BPLR  based on its affordability of 
 Notes 
credit  The BPLR was arrived at after taking into account four important 
components like average cost of deposits  operating expenses  probable 
loan losses  and a profit margin  Despite these guidelines  the bargaining 
power of the well-rated borrower forced banks to quote sub-PLR BPLR 
rates  to withstand the competition  About   of loans to well-rated 
companies were estimated to have been sanctioned at below PLR BPLR 
rates  These practices were cutting into the profit of the banks  Keeping 
this in view  RBI advised the banks to quote a base rate and to not finance 
any borrower below this rate  From the month of July   the banks were 
not allowed to lend below the base rate  Since July   the base rates 
quoted by the banks were in the range   to   Hence  companies 
found it difficult to raise credit facilities at a lower rate of interest through 
the banking system  Commercial Paper appeared to be a better alternate 
source of finance 
Question 
  Is commercial paper a better alternate source of finance  Analyse

Introduction 
Development Banks or Development Financial Institutions  DFIs 
were established mainly to provide long-term capital for industry and 
agriculture  It had been found that commercial banks  by the short-term 
nature of their deposits which they mobilize  were in a position to grant 
only short-term credit to industry and agriculture to meet their working 
capital requirements  An attempt was made  initially in Germany  to start 
industrial banks or mixed banks as they were commonly called to give 
long term credit to industry and these banks had a fair amount of success 
in the industrialization of Germany 
But in developing countries like India it was not possible to have 
mixed banking  even though there was a great demand for such institutions 
to finance economic growth  The basic reason for this was that banking 
 Notes 
habit has not fully developed and that commercial banks could not take 
heavy risks by freezing short-term depositor s money in long-term and 
medium-term loans to industry and agriculture 
It was in this context that the Government of India established a 
number of institutions since independence to provide long-term finance to 
industry  trade and agriculture  The Government of India along with RBI 
and the banking system set up IFCI  SFCs  ICICI  IDBI  IRBI  Unit Trust of 
India  LIC and GIC  All these institutions provide finance for industries 
Then we have Export-Import Bank  EXIM Bank  which specializes 
in international trade  the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural 
Development  NABARD  the Shipping Credit and Investment Company 
Ltd to finance shipping and fishing industries  etc  These institutions were 
called development banks or public sector financial institutions  They are 
now referred to as development finance institutions  DFIs 
Structure of Industrial and Agricultural Banking System in India 
The Indian agricultural and industrial banking system has travelled 
a lot and many changes have happened in tune with the requirements of 
the industry  trade  agriculture and other specialized sectors  The financial 
institutions which help industry  agriculture and other sectors in India 
can be classified into five categories and they consist of the following

Role of Industrial Finance Corporation of India  IFCI 
Genesis of IFCI 
At the time of independence in   India s capital market was 
relatively under-developed  Although there was significant demand 
for new capital  there was a dearth of providers  Merchant bankers and 
underwriting firms were almost non-existent and commercial banks were 
not equipped to provide long-term industrial finance in any significant 
manner  It is against this backdrop that the government established The 
Industrial Finance Corporation of India  IFCI  on July     as the first 
Development Financial Institution  DFI  in the country to cater to the 
long-term finance needs of the industrial sector  The newly-established 
DFI was provided access to low-cost funds through the central bank s 
Statutory Liquidity Ratio or SLR which in turn enabled it to provide loans 
and advances to corporate borrowers at concessional rates 
Liberalization - Conversion into Company in  
By the early  s  it was recognized that there was need for greater 
flexibility to respond to the changing financial system  It was also felt that 
IFCI should directly access the capital markets for its funds needs  It is 
with this objective that the constitution of IFCI was changed in   from 
a statutory corporation to a company under the Indian Companies Act 
  Subsequently  the name of the company was also changed to  IFCI 
Limited  with effect from October  
Corporate Strategy 
IFCI has been able to achieve a financial turnaround with the 
consistent support and cooperation of all its stakeholders and is now 
endeavouring to re-position itself  In addition to its core competence in 
long term lending to industrial and infrastructure sectors  IFCI aims to 
enhance its organizational value through better realization of its Non- 
performing Assets  NPAs  and unlocking of value of its investment 
portfolio including unquoted investments as well as real estate assets 
 Notes 
Indian Economy and IFCI 
Until the establishment of ICICI in   and IDBI in   IFCI 
remained solely responsible for implementation of the Government s 
industrial policy initiatives  It made a significant contribution to the 
modernization of Indian industry  export promotion  import substitution 
pollution control  energy conservation and generation through 
commercially viable and market-friendly initiatives  Some sectors that 
have directly benefited from IFCI include 
     
Agro-based industry  textiles  paper  sugar 
     
Service industry  hotels  hospitals 
     
Basic industry  iron   steel  fertilizers  basic chemicals  cement 
     
Capital   intermediate goods industry  electronics  synthetic fibres 
synthetic plastics  miscellaneous chemicals  and Infrastructure 
 power generation  telecom services 
IFCI s Economic Contribution 
IFCI s economic contribution can be measured from the following 
  By way of illustration  IFCI s assistance has been helped to create 
production capacities of   million spindles in the textile industry 
  million tons per annum  tpa  of sugar production  million tpa 
of paper and paper products    million tpa of fertilizers   
million tpa of cement    million tpa of iron and steel    million 
tpa of petroleum refining    MW of electricity    hotel 
rooms    hospital beds    port projects    telecom projects and 
  bridge project 
  The direct employment generated as a result of its financial 
assistance is estimated at almost   million persons 
  IFCI has played a key role in the development of cooperatives in 
the sugar and textile sectors  besides acting as a nodal agency in 
both sectors    cooperative societies in these sectors have been 
assisted by IFCI 
  IFCI has promoted Technical Consultancy Organizations  TCOs 
primarily in less developed states to provide necessary services to the 
 Notes 
promoters of small and medium-sized industries in collaboration 
with other banks and institutions 
  IFCI has also provided assistance to self-employed youth and 
women entrepreneurs under its Benevolent Reserve Fund  BRF 
and the Interest Differential Fund  IDF 
  IFCI has founded and developed prominent institutions like 
     
Management Development Institute  MDI  for management 
training and development 
     
ICRA for credit assessment rating 
     
Tourism Finance Corporation of India  TFCI  for promotion 
of the hotel and tourism industry

GIC Housing Finance Ltd  and 
     
Biotech Consortium India Ltd   BCIL 
  IFCI has also set up Chairs in reputed educational management 
institutions and universities

provided by it to some of today s leading Indian entrepreneurs who 
may not have been able to start their enterprises or expand without 
the initial support from IFCI

Role of Industrial Credit Investment Corporation of India 
 Erstwhile ICICI     Now ICICI Bank - Private Sector Bank 
History of Erstwhile ICICI 
The Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India Limited 
 ICICI  incorporated in the year   at the initiative of the World Bank 
the Government of India and representatives of Indian industry  with the 
objective of creating a development financial institution for providing 
medium-term and long-term project financing to Indian businesses 
Mr A Ramaswami Mudaliar elected as the first Chairman of ICICI 
Limited  ICICI emerged as the major source of foreign currency loans to 
Indian industry  Besides funding from the World Bank and other multi- 
lateral agencies  ICICI was also among the first Indian companies to raise 
funds from international markets  As a result of nationalization of major 
commercial banks and insurance companies  which were the shareholders 
of ICICI  in   over   percent of its issued share capital was held by 
public sector corporations  Despite the majority public sector shareholding 
until the   ICICI maintained the dynamism of a private sector DFI 
Because of the high growth in operations and with the development of the 
capital market  ICICI increased equity  as well as domestic and international 
borrowing  and changed its shareholding pattern  In   ICICI made 
a right-cum-public share issue of     billion  This resulted in the decline of 
the share of the public sector and the increase of individual holders 
Scope of Operations of Erstwhile ICICI 
ICICI s operational activities consisted mainly of extending 
medium- and long-term loans in local and foreign currencies to assist in 
the creation  expansion  and modernization of medium and large industrial 
enterprises  predominantly in the private sector  ICICI had played a key role 
in providing foreign exchange financing  It also makes equity investments 
underwrites new shares and debenture issues  and guarantees loans from 
other investment sources  Since the early  s  as a part of its strategy to 
provide various forms of assistance to industry  ICICI had diversified its 
activities to cover financial services  such as leasing and deferred credit 
As the Indian economy began to be liberalized in the early  s  ICICI 
needed to become a financial supermarket by offering a wide range of 
financial services to cope with growing opportunities and competition 
 Notes 
ICICI entered new areas of business  such as commercial banking and 
asset management  and expanded its existing businesses  for example 
merchant banking services  which include capital issue management  For 
regulatory and strategic reasons  specialized subsidiaries were established 
for the following activities  investment banking  commercial banking 
fund management  investor services  and broking 
In addition  ICICI had diversified its own range of activities into 
several fee-based services  including custodial services to cater to the needs 
of foreign and domestic institutional investors  To facilitate the globalization 
of Indian industry  ICICI had established new divisions to advise Indian 
corporations planning to establish operations abroad and foreign 
companies looking for local partners  ICICI also provided technology 
financing for development and commercialization of technology  ICICI 
had already played a key role in the infrastructure sector by providing 
advisory services to the Central Government and state governments and 
to government agencies in the power and telecommunications sectors  and 
has sanctioned   million for projects mainly in power and ports 
Emergence of ICICI Bank 
ICICI Bank was originally promoted in   by ICICI Limited 
an Indian developmental financial institution  and was its wholly-owned 
subsidiary  ICICI s shareholding in ICICI Bank was reduced to   through 
a public offering of shares in India in fiscal   an equity offering in the 
form of ADRs listed on the NYSE in fiscal   ICICI Bank s acquisition of 
Bank of Madura Limited in an all-stock amalgamation in fiscal   and 
secondary market sales by ICICI to institutional investors in fiscal  
and fiscal   ICICI was formed in   at the initiative of the World 
Bank  the Government of India and representatives of Indian industry 
The principal objective was to create a development financial institution 
for providing medium-term and long-term project financing to Indian 
businesses 
In the  s  ICICI transformed its business from a development 
financial institution offering only project finance to a diversified financial 
services group offering a wide variety of products and services  both 
directly and through a number of subsidiaries and affiliates like ICICI 
Bank  In   ICICI become the first Indian company and the first bank 
or financial institution from non-Japan Asia to be listed on the NYSE 
 Notes 
Reverse Merger of ICICI with ICICI Bank 
After consideration of various corporate structuring alternatives 
in the context of the emerging competitive scenario in the Indian banking 
industry  and the move towards universal banking  the managements of 
ICICI and ICICI Bank formed the view that the merger of ICICI with ICICI 
Bank would be the optimal strategic alternative for both entities  and would 
create the optimal legal structure for the ICICI group s universal banking 
strategy  The merger would enhance value for ICICI shareholders through 
the merged entity s access to low-cost deposits  greater opportunities for 
earning fee-based income and the ability to participate in the payments 
system and provide transaction-banking services  The merger would 
enhance value for ICICI Bank shareholders through a large capital base 
and scale of operations  seamless access to ICICI s strong corporate 
relationships built up over five decades  entry into new business segments 
higher market share in various business segments  particularly fee-based 
services  and access to the vast talent pool of ICICI and its subsidiaries

Bank approved the merger of ICICI and two of its wholly-owned retail 
finance subsidiaries  ICICI Personal Financial Services Limited and ICICI

Role of Industrial Development Bank of India  IDBI   Erstwhile IDBI 
   Now IDBI Bank Ltd    Other Public Sector Bank Category 
Brief History of IDBI 
Industrial Development Bank of India  IDBI  was established 
in   by the Government of India  GoI  under an Act of Parliament 
the Industrial Development Bank of India Act     the IDBI Act  as a 
wholly-owned subsidiary of Reserve Bank of India  RBI  to provide credit 
and extend other facilities for the development of industry  In   the 
ownership of IDBI was transferred to the GOI and it was entrusted with the 
additional responsibility of acting as the principal financial institution for 
coordinating the activities of institutions engaged in financing  promotion 
or development of industry 
Over the last four decades  IDBI s role as catalyst to industrial 
development has encompassed a broad spectrum of activities  IDBI had 
extended finance to all types of industrial concerns covered under the 
provisions of the IDBl Act irrespective of the size or form or sector of 
organization  IDBI primarily provided finance to large and medium 
industrial enterprises engaged or to be engaged in the manufacture 
processing or preservation of goods  mining  shipping  transport  hotel 
industry  information technology  medical and health  leasing generation 
and distribution of power  maintenance  repair  testing  servicing of 
vehicles  setting up of industrial estates as also in the research and 
development for promotion of industrial growth 
IDBI had also been assigned a special role for co-coordinating the 
activities of institutions engaged in financing  promoting or developing 
industries  In the past  the GOI had provided direct and indirect financial 
assistance and support to IDBI including access to low cost funds and 
assistance by way of restructuring of high cost liabilities  Though GOI has 
no legal obligation to provide financial assistance or extend support to 
IDBI  it had done so from time to time considering the unique role assigned 
to IDBI in the industrial development of the country  The structural 
changes in the industrial sector including the opening up of the economy 
and the ongoing disintermediation in the financial sector had changed 
the credit profile of IDBI  The sources and availability of cheap long term 
funds declined resulting in difficulties in operations as a standalone DFI 
 Notes 
Industrial Development Bank of India Limited 
In response to the felt need and on commercial prudence  it was 
decided to transform IDBI into a Bank  For the purpose  Industrial 
Development bank  transfer of undertaking and Repeal  Act     Repeal 
Act  was passed repealing the Industrial Development Bank of India Act 
  In terms of the provisions of the Repeal Act  a new company under 
the name of Industrial Development Bank of India Limited  IDBI Ltd 
was incorporated as a Govt  Company under the Companies Act    on 
September     Thereafter  the undertaking of IDBI was transferred 
to and vested in IDBI Ltd  with effect from the effective date of October 
    In terms of the provisions of the Repeal Act  IDBI Ltd  has 
been functioning as a Bank in addition to its earlier role of a Financial 
Institution 
Merger of IDBI Bank with IDBI 
To create a more conducive environment for the transition and to 
give fillip to the business operations of the new entity  IDBI Ltd  the then 
IDBI s Board decided that for effective transition to a banking company 
IDBI Ltd  should leverage on its banking subsidiary  IDBI Bank Ltd  The 
scheme of Amalgamation Merger of IDBI Bank Ltd  with IDBI Ltd became 
effective from October     after the same was approved separately by 
the respective General Body of Shareholders and by RBI  in terms of the 
provisions of the Banking Regulation Act   
The merger has brought in benefits in terms of enhanced size and 
improved quality of balance sheet  lower cost of funds  extended branch 
network  a higher technology platform  lean workforce  along with a wide 
array of retail and wholesale products  This has benefited the various 
stakeholders by increased value creation  along with the convenience of a 
universal bank  The benefits of economies of scale and the convenience of 
single-window servicing to clients is a major advantage  The opportunity 
for the Bank has come from the access to cheaper short-term retail funds 
This has enabled the Bank to lower its overall cost of liability and price the 
products competitively 
Enlarging the clientele base through market penetration  product 
diversification or market development  market segmentation and pro- 
 Notes 
viding structured products under a single roof are the other advantages 
for the Bank  Also  the enlarged capital base of the Bank has provided

crossed   crore Sum Assured on new policies

offices    divisional offices    zonal offices    satellite offices and the 
Corporate office  LIC s Wide Area Network covers   divisional offices 
and connects all the branches through a Metro Area Network  LIC has 
tied up with some Banks and Service providers to offer on-line premium 
collection facility in selected cities  LIC s ECS and ATM premium payment 
facility is an addition to customer convenience  Apart from on-line Kiosks 
and IVRS  Info Centres have been commissioned at Mumbai  Ahmedabad 
Bangalore  Chennai  Hyderabad  Kolkata  New Delhi  Pune and many 
other cities  With a vision of providing easy access to its policyholders 
LIC has launched its SATELLITE SAMPARK offices  The satellite offices 
are smaller  leaner and closer to the customer  The digitalized records 
of the satellite offices will facilitate anywhere servicing and many other 
conveniences in the future 
LIC continues to be the dominant life insurer even in the liberalized 
scenario of Indian insurance and is moving fast on a new growth trajectory 
surpassing its own past records  LIC has issued over one crore policies 
during the current year  It has crossed the milestone of issuing  
new policies by  th Oct    posting a healthy growth rate of  
over the corresponding period of the previous year  From then to now

Housing and Urban Development Corporation of India  HUDCO 
Genesis 
The housing and urban development sector plays a significant role 
in the economic and social development of a country  The access to and the 
quality of housing and urban basic services directly influence the quality 
of life of people  their productivity levels and growth potential  Before 
the establishment of HUDCO  the Government of India was operating a 
number of subsidized housing schemes and loan schemes  The subsidized 
housing schemes were meant for industrial workers  economically weaker 
section of the society and slum dwellers  while the loan schemes were 
 Notes 
targeted for the people in the low-income and middle-income groups 
as well as rental housing schemes for State Government employees  All 
these schemes were under the direct control of the Ministry of Works and 
Housing  Such a system of housing finance did not give the required thrust 
for promoting housing development activities  which in many cases were 
considered of lower priority 
Towards the close of the  s  it was realized the need of a setting 
up a housing organization in the country as the availability and cost of 
bank credit were the prime constraints in this development  Since the 
banking industry  until then  was in the hands of a few industrial houses 
the first major step taken to initiate change in favour of the poor was the 
nationalization of the banks in June   However  when the then Hon ble 
Prime Minister Smt Indira Gandhi looked for ways to improve the living 
conditions of slum-dwellers and economically less fortunate peoples  she 
found that while we had a host of All India Term Lending Institution such 
as IDBI  IFCI  ICICI etc  catering to the diverse credit and related needs of 
the Indian industry  there was no institution to provide housing finance to 
the rural and urban poor or the even to meet the credit needs of housing 
boards  development authorities and other urban bodies which were being 
setup by the State Government during the fourth Plan period 
It was in this context that a decision was taken at the highest level 
to set a Housing and Urban Development Corporation  HUDCO  which 
could take a comprehensive look at the need of the sector and find workable 
and effective solutions  This experiment of establishing a unique techno- 
financial institution and the fascinating journey it undertook during the 
last four decades would certainly qualify as one of the key developments 
in this sector in the whole world  The establishment of HUDCO in  
as a sectoral institution for comprehensively dealing with the problems of 
growing housing shortages  rising number of slums and for fulfilling the 
pressing needs of the economically weaker section of the society was one 
of the significant steps in the series of initiatives taken by Government 
Thus the setting up of HUDCO was aimed at accelerating the pace of con- 
struction and elimination of housing shortages and for orderly develop- 
ment of urban centres  The Housing and Urban Development Corporation 
Ltd   HUDCO  was incorporated on April     under the Companies 
Act   as a fully owned enterprise of the Government of India 
 Notes 
Objectives

Introduction 
In this lesson  let us understand the role of international financial 
institutions such as IBRD  IFC and IDA 
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development  IBRD 
Background 
Founded in   to help Europe recover from World War II  the 
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development  IBRD  is one 
of five institutions that make up the World Bank Group  IBRD is the 
part of the World Bank  IBRD IDA  that works with middle-income and 
creditworthy poorer countries to promote sustainable  equitable and job- 
creating growth  reduce poverty and address issues of regional and global 
importance 
Structured something like a cooperative  IBRD is owned and 
operated for the benefit of its   member countries  Delivering flexible 
timely and tailored financial products  knowledge and technical services 
and strategic advice helps its members achieve results  Through the World 
Bank Treasury  IBRD clients also have access to capital on favorable terms 
in larger volumes  with longer maturities  and in a more sustainable 
manner than world financial markets typically provide 
 Notes 
Specifically  the IBRD 
     
supports long-term human and social development needs that 
private creditors do not finance 
     
preserves borrowers  financial strength by providing support 
in crisis periods  which is when poor people are most adversely 
affected 
     
uses the leverage of financing to promote key policy and institutional 
reforms  such as safety net or anticorruption reforms 
     
creates a favorable investment climate in order to catalyze the 
provision of private capital 
     
provides financial support  in the form of grants made available 
from the IBRD s net income  in areas that are critical to the well- 
being of poor people in all countries 
Middle-income countries  where   percent of the world s poor 
live  have made profound improvements in economic management and 
governance over the past two decades and are rapidly increasing their 
demand for the strategic  intellectual and financial resources the World 
Bank has to offer  The challenge facing the IBRD is to better manage and 
deliver its resources to best meet the needs of these countries  To increase 
its impact in middle-income countries  IBRD is working closely with the 
International Finance Corporation  IFC  the Multilateral Investment 
Guarantee Agency  MIGA  the International Monetary Fund  IMF 
and other multilateral development banks  In the course of its work 
IBRD is also striving to capitalize on middle-income countries  own 
accumulated knowledge and development experiences and collaborates 
with foundations  civil society partners and donors in the development 
community 
IBRD Products and Services 
IBRD aims to reduce poverty in middle-income and creditworthy 
poorer countries by promoting sustainable development through loans 
guarantees  risk management products  and  non-lending  analytical and 
advisory services 
 Notes 
IBRD has three main business lines

How IBRD is Financed 
IBRD raises most of its funds on the world s financial markets  It 
has become one of the most established borrowers since issuing its first 
bond in   to finance the reconstruction of Europe after World War 
Two  Investors see IBRD bonds as a safe and profitable place to put their 
money and their cash finances projects in middle-income countries  The 
income that IBRD has generated over the years has allowed it to fund 
development activities and to ensure its financial strength  which enables 
it to borrow at low cost and offer clients  good borrowing terms 
IBRD became a major player on the international capital markets by 
developing modern debt products  opening new markets for debt issuance 
and by building up a broad investor base around the world of pension 
funds  insurance companies  central banks  and individuals  The World 
Bank s borrowing requirements are primarily determined by its lending 
activities for development projects  As World Bank lending has changed 
over time  so has its annual borrowing program  In   for example 
IBRD borrowing peaked at   billion with the Asian financial crisis  It is 
now projected to borrow between   to   billion a year  IBRD borrows 
at attractive rates on the capital markets thanks to its triple-A status that 
it has had with credit rating agencies since   This has enabled it to 
borrow in U S  dollars  for example  at an overall funding cost that comes 
close to that of the U S  Treasury 
 Notes 
IBRD enjoys its high credit rating because it is backed by the 
capital commitments of its   shareholder governments  It is also the 
result of IBRD s strong balance sheet  prudent financial policies  and its 
expected treatment as a preferred creditor when a country has difficulty 
in repaying its loans  IBRD has also profited from anticipating shifts in 
investor preferences and investing in the risk management and systems 
to take advantage of those trends  IBRD has to its credit a string of firsts 
in its borrowing program  These include the first currency swap in 
international markets in   through to the introduction of the first 
global bond in   to the first fully integrated electronic bond offering 
via the Internet in   In   the World Bank executed the first fully 
electronic swap auction 
Innovations by IBRD have also supported its goal of promoting 
development  Although much of its borrowing is in U S  dollars  IBRD has 
over the years offered bonds in more than   different currencies  Its issues 
in nascent capital markets have often been a catalyst for improving market 
infrastructure and efficiency  IBRD s earns an income every year from the 
return on its equity and from the small margin it makes on lending  This 
pays for IBRD s operating expenses  goes into reserves to strengthen the 
balance sheet and also provides an annual transfer to the International 
Development Association  IDA  IBRD has raised the bulk of the money 
loaned by the World Bank to alleviate poverty around the world  This 
has been done at a relatively low cost to taxpayers  with governments 
paying in   billion in capital since   to generate more than 
  billion in loans

IDA History 
The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development 
 IBRD  better known as the World Bank  was established in   to 
help Europe recover from the devastation of World War II  The success 
 Notes 
of that enterprise led the Bank  within a few years  to turn its attention 
to the developing countries  By the  s  it became clear that the 
poorest developing countries needed softer terms than those that could 
be offered by the Bank  so they could afford to borrow the capital they 
needed to grow  In the early  s  reports from the United Nations and 
the U S  government supported the establishment of a program to lend 
to poor countries on concessional terms with the backing of multilateral 
donors  After initial deliberations  the idea to create the International 
Development Association  IDA  an agency to provide  soft-loans  to 
developing countries  was floated within the Bank under the stewardship 
of President Eugene Black  Monroney Resolution received support from 
Democratic Senator Mike Monroney of Oklahoma  who was interested in 
the provision of soft-loans for developing nations with the World Bank 
as the dispenser of the aid  When appointed chairman of the Senate 
Subcommittee on International Finance  he proposed what came to be 
known as the Monroney Resolution 
Articles of Agreement for IDA 
As the resolution was passed in the U S  Senate  the U S  Treasury 
Secretary announced at the   annual Bank and Fund meetings in New 
Delhi that the U S  was seriously studying the proposal of a Bank-based 
IDA and hoped others would do the same  After consultations  which 
began among the member governments of the World Bank in   the 
Bank s Board of Governors at its Annual Meeting in   approved a 
United States resolution calling on the Bank s Executive Directors to draft

Micro Finance Institutions  MFIs 
MFIs could play a significant role in facilitating inclusion  as they 
are uniquely positioned in reaching out to the rural poor  Many of them 
operate in a limited geographical area  have a greater understanding of the 
issues specific to the rural poor  enjoy greater acceptability amongst the 
rural poor and have flexibility in operations providing a level of comfort 
to their clientele  There are several legal forms of MFIs  However  firm 
data regarding the number of MFIs operating under different forms is not 
available  It is roughly estimated that there are about   NGO-MFIs 
and more than   Company MFIs  Further  in Andhra Pradesh  nearly 
  cooperative organizations are engaged in MF activities  However 
the company MFIs are major players accounting for over  of the 
microfinance loan portfolio 
 Notes 
Definition of Microfinance and MFIs 
The proposed Microfinance Services Regulation Bill defines micro 
finance services as  providing financial assistance to an individual or an 
eligible client  either directly or through a group mechanism for 
i  an amount  not exceeding rupees fifty thousand in aggregate per 
individual  for small and tiny enterprise  agriculture  allied activi- 
ties  including for consumption purposes of such individual  or 
ii  an amount not exceeding rupees one lakh fifty thousand in 
aggregate per individual for housing purposes  or 
such other amounts  for any of the purposes mentioned at items  i 
and  ii  above or other purposes  as may be prescribed 
The proposed regulations further define an MFI as  an organization 
or association of individuals including the following if it is established 
for the purpose of carrying on the business of extending microfinance 
services 
iii 
a  a society registered under the Societies Registration Act   
b  a trust created under the Indian Trust Act  or public trust 
registered under any State enactment governing trust or public 
religious or charitable purposes 
c  a cooperative society   mutual benefit society   mutually aided 
society registered under any State enactment relating to such 
societies or any multistate cooperative society registered under the 
Multi State Cooperative Societies Act    but not including 
     
a cooperative bank as defined in clause  cci  of section   of the 
Banking Regulation Act    or 
     
a cooperative society engaged in agricultural operations or 
industrial activity or purchase or sale of any goods and services 
MF-NBFCs as BCs 
MF-NBFCs operate in a limited geographic area and have local feel 
To enable the poor to have access to savings services  MF-NBFCs may 
be recognized as Business Correspondents of banks for only providing 
savings and remittance services 
 Notes 
Relaxation in FIPB Guidelines 
     
Current guidelines used by FIPB  Foreign Investment Promotion 
Board  require a minimum of US    equity investment 
from a foreign entity  NBFCs are eligible to access such funds and 
leverage local capital market financing  MFNBFCs may be able to 
attract social investors with relatively modest means for whom such 
a high level of investment may be beyond reach  As MF-NBFCs 
initial capital needs may not be very large  the Committee is of the 
view that the minimum amount of foreign equity for MF-NBFCs 
may be reduced to a level of US   
     
To facilitate raising Indian equity  NABARD may extend equity 
support out of its MFDEF to such MF-NBFCs based on objective 
rating   criteria  NABARD may accord priority in providing equity 
support to those MF-NBFCs operating in regions featuring high 
levels of exclusion 
     
To further facilitate raising India equity  the SEBI Venture Capital 
Guidelines may permit Venture Capital Funds to invest in MF- 
NBFCs 
Tax Concessions 
To facilitate build up of reserves  MF-NBFCs may be allowed 
like Housing Finance Companies and Infrastructure Companies  tax 
concessions to the extent of  of their profits  as a proportion to their 
business portfolio in excluded districts as identified by NABARD without 
attracting tax  For this  the Committee recommends that MF-NBFCs may 
be included as eligible institutions under Section    viii  of the Income 
Tax Act 
MF-NBFCs as Micro Insurance Agents 
The lives and livelihoods of poor households are full of uncovered 
risk  Hence insurance is essential for them  To enable MF-NBFCs to offer 
risk mitigation services to the poor  the Committee recommends that the 
IRDA Micro insurance Guidelines    may permit MF-NBFCs to offer 
micro insurance services as agents of regulated life and non-life insurance 
companies 
 Notes 
Code of Conduct 
A voluntary mutual code of conduct has been prepared by some 
MFIs covering aspects including mission  governance  transparency 
interest rates  handling of customer grievances  staff conduct  recovery 
practices  etc  After due consultations within the sector  such code of 
conduct may be made mandatory for MFIs 
Accounting and Disclosure Norms 
     
The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India  ICAI  may be 
involved in formulating appropriate accounting and disclosure 
norms for MFIs  so that they can generate confidence 
     
The cost of funds for MFIs  their operating costs  risk premium 
etc  have to be studied for a better understanding of viable and 
economic rates of interest that can be charged by them  Banks 
lending to MFIs may undertake such studies and exercise a lender s 
discipline in enforcing reasonable rates of interest and acceptable 
modes of recovery 
Unifying Regulatory Oversight 
At present  all the regulatory aspects of microfinance are not 
centralized  For example  while the Rural Planning and Credit Department 
 RPCD  in RBI looks after rural lending  MF-NBFCs are under the control 
of the Department of Non-Banking Supervision  DNBS  and External 
Commercial Borrowings are looked after by the Foreign Exchange 
Department  The Committee feels that RBI may consider bringing all 
regulatory aspects of microfinance under a single mechanism  Further 
supervision of MF-NBFCs could be delegated to NABARD by RBI 
Micro Financial Sector  Development and Regulation  Bill   
The Micro Financial Sector  Development and Regulation  Bill 
  has been introduced in Parliament in March   The Committee 
feels that the Bill  when enacted  would help in promoting orderly growth 
of microfinance sector in India  For improving the effectiveness of the Bill 
the Committee makes the following suggestions 
 Notes 
     
NBFCs and Section   companies are left out of the purview of 
the proposed Bill  NBFCs are currently regulated by RBI  though 
RBI has exempted them for registration as NBFCs if they do not 
take deposits  It is recommended that Section   companies can be 
brought under the purview of this Bill 
     
Cooperative societies registered under the  MACS Act   
promulgated by some of the States   are eligible to mobilize savings 
from their members  For mobilizing savings  these societies also 
need to be registered with NABARD under the proposed Bill  Hence 
there is likely to be conflict between  MACS Act  and the proposed 
Bill  Moreover  cooperative societies provide savings and credit 
facilities to their own members  It is  therefore  suggested that the 
cooperatives can be taken out of the purview of the proposed Bill 
SIDBI Foundation for Micro Credit  SFMC 
Mission 
SIDBI Foundation for Micro Credit  SFMC  was launched by the 
Bank in January   for channelizing funds to the poor in line with 
the success of pilot phase of Micro Credit Scheme  SFMC s mission is to 
create a national network of strong  viable and sustainable Micro Finance 
Institutions  MFIs  from the informal and formal financial sector to 
provide micro finance services to the poor  especially women 
Approach 
SFMC is the apex wholesaler for micro finance in India providing a 
complete range of financial and non-financial services such as loan funds 
grant support  equity and institution building support to the retailing 
Micro Finance Institutions  MFIs  including two-tier MFIs so as to 
facilitate their development into financially sustainable entities  besides 
developing a network of service providers for the sector  SFMC is also 
playing significant role in advocating appropriate policies and regulations 
and to act as a platform for exchange of information across the sector  The 
launch of SFMC by SIDBI has been with a clear focus and strategy to make 
it as the main purveyor of micro finance in the country  Operations of 
SFMC in the coming years  are not only expected to contribute significantly 
towards development of a more formal  extensive and effective micro 
 Notes 
finance sector serving the poor in India  but also ensure sustainability at 
all levels viz  at the apex level  SFMC  at the MFI level and at the client 
level to ensure continuance of such arrangement  Most importantly  SFMC 
has strived to create a mechanism in which there should be no barriers to 
growth  Under the dispensation  there is focus on innovation and action 
research 
Uniqueness 
a  Rating of MFIs 
Most micro finance programmes are being operated by NGOs 
and are not subjected to regulation and supervision as they are registered 
as Societies or Trusts  Non-regulation of these institutions has worked 
to their detriment and these institutions are not able to have smooth 
access to funds from the financial sector which is vary of lending to such 
entities  This constraint  coupled with the fact that SFMC was launched 
with a view to upscale the flow of micro credit with enabling policy 
modifications relating to simplification of the procedures in availment of 
assistance and substantial relaxation in the security  collateral requirement 
posed a difficult challenge  Therefore  to meet the requirements of the 
revised dispensation which called for selection of suitable micro finance 
intermediaries which could be trusted with bulk assistance without 
collateral constraints  Capacity Assessment Rating  CAR  was introduced 
by SFMC as a supplementary tool to assess the risk perception  On SFMC s 
initiative  the rating of MFIs have been started by four agencies  Till March 
      ratings have been commissioned to MCRIL  CRISIL  CARE 
Access Development Services  ADS  SFMC has also organized trainings 
on CAMEL methodology of ACCION to build the internal capacity of 
SFMC officers 
b  Customized Support to MFIs 
MFIs are provided annual need based assistance  One of the unique 
features of the scheme is the comprehensive Capacity Building Support 
being provided to the MFIs  NGOs to expand their operations as well 
as to increase their efficiency  Customized financial support comprising 
of loans  capacity building grant as well as equity  quasi equity is being 
provided to the client institutions 
 Notes 
c  Minimal Security Requirement 
Credit worthiness is based on the rating of the borrowing institutions 
rather than availability of security  collateral requirements  Term Deposit 
Receipts  TDRs  issued by Scheduled Commercial Banks  SIDBI for an 
amount equivalent to        depending upon geographical area 
of operation and duration of partnership with SIDBI 
d  Methodology Neutral 
SIDBI s support is not for any specific methodology  MFIs may on 
lend directly to SHGs  individuals or route their assistance through their 
partner NGOs   MFIs  They may also adopt any other lending channel so 
as to effectively reach financial assistance to the poor clients 
e  Capacity Building Support for the Sector 
SFMC s capacity building efforts are directed not only towards MFIs 
but also towards smaller  grass root institutions engaged in micro finance 
operations  training  consultancy  rating and impact assessment etc  and 
other service providers in the form of training  seminars  workshops 
orientation and exposure visits 
f  Innovation   Action Research 
SIDBI has taken a number of initiatives in launching   facilitating 
introduction   market-making of new concepts in the sector  The launch of 
an electronic portal for information dissemination and knowledge sharing 
within the sector and development of MIS software for MFIs are some such 
initiatives  Other major initiatives include developing a common charter 
of accounts for the sector  creating gender and environment awareness 
promoting innovations and action research on emerging concepts etc 
The environment appraisal of SFMC activities was carried out by the 
Society for Participatory Research in Asia  PRA  New Delhi and covered 
areas like identification of environmental risks associated with some of 
the most relevant activities funded through the SFMC microfinance 
route  developing a format for identifying these risks in micro-project 
identification and drawing up some simple guidelines on risk mitigation 
 Notes 
The appraisal covered   partner MFIs of the Bank located in and around 
Chennai  Hyderabad  Bhubaneswar and Kolkata 
g  Opening of Specialized Microfinance Branches 
Seven dedicated microfinance branches have been opened by the 
Bank at Lucknow  Chennai  Hyderabad  Bangalore  Kolkata  Bhubaneswar 
and Guwahati to deliver micro finance services through intermediaries 
in a timely and customer-friendly manner  While Hyderabad  Chennai 
Bangalore are major hubs of microfinance activity in the country  the other 
centres viz  Lucknow  Kolkata  Bhubaneswar and Guwahati have been 
targeted with the primary objective of giving an impetus to microfinance 
programmes in the underserved areas 
Support Offered to MFIs 
a  On-lending 
In keeping with its mission  SIDBI Foundation identifies  nurtures 
and develops select potential MFIs as long term partners and provides credit 
support for their micro credit initiatives  The eligible partner institutions 
of SIDBI Foundation  therefore  comprise large and medium scale MFIs 
having minimum fund requirement of     lakh per annum  Large and 
medium scale MFIs having considerable experience in managing micro 
credit programmes  high growth potential  good track record  professional 
expertise and committed to viability are provided financial assistance for 
on-lending  Under the present dispensation  annual need based assistance 
is provided to enable MFIs to expand their scale of operations and achieve 
self sufficiency at the earliest  Lending is based strictly on an intensive 
in-house appraisal supplemented with the capacity assessment rating by 
an independent professional agency  Liberal security norms have also 
been adopted to reduce procedural bottlenecks as well as to facilitate easy 
disbursements 
b  Capacity Building 
The long-term future of the micro-finance sector depends on 
MFIs being able to achieve operational  financial and institutional 
sustainability  The constraints and challenges vary with the different types 
 Notes 
and development stage of MFIs  Most MFIs are currently operating below 
operational viability and use grant funds from donors for financing up- 
front costs of establishing new groups and covering initial losses incurred 
until the lending volume builds up to a break-even level  The MFIs are 
generally constrained in reaching a break-even level and finally achieving 
sustainability  primarily due to a narrow client and product base  high 
operational and administrative costs for delivering credit to the poor  and 
their inability to mobilize requisite resources  Moreover  lack of technical 
manpower  operational systems  infrastructure and MIS are prevalent  In 
view of the above  to scale up micro-finance initiatives at a faster pace 
a special effort is required for capacity building of the Micro Finance 
Institutions  In this background  SFMC has in the past under the DFID 
collaboration  which has since come to an end on March   provided 
need based capacity building support to the partner MFIs  in the initial 
years  to enable them to expand their operations  cover their managerial 
administrative and operational costs besides helping them achieve self- 
sufficiency in due course 
c  Liquidity Management 
In view of the fact that liquidity is a major concern of many of 
the middle level MFIs and a small working capital support can go a long 
way in their better liquidity management and thus pave way for faster 
growth  SFMC has introduced a special short term loan scheme  Liquidity 
Management Support  LMS  for the long term partners 
d  Equity 
Provision of equity capital to the NBFC-MFIs is perceived as an 
emerging requirement of the micro finance sector in India  SIDBI provides 
equity capital to eligible institutions not only to enable them to meet 
the capital adequacy requirements but also to help them leverage debt 
funds  Keeping in tune with the sectoral requirements  the bank has also 
introduced quasi-equity products viz  Optionally convertible Preference 
share capital  Optionally convertible debt and Optionally convertible 
Subordinate debt for new generation MFIs which are generally in the pre- 
breakeven stage requiring special dispensation for capital support by way 
of a mix of Tier I and Tier II capital 
 Notes 
e  Transformation Loan 
The Transformation Loan  TL  product is envisaged as a quasi- 
equity type support to partner MFIs that are in the process of transforming 
themselves   their existing structure into a more formal and regulated set- 
up for exclusively handling micro finance operations in a focused manner 
Being quasi-equity in nature  TL helps the MFIs not only in enhancing 
their equity base but also in leveraging loan funds and expanding their 
micro credit operations on a sustainable basis  The product has the feature 
of conversion into equity after a specified period of time subject to the MFI 
attaining certain structural  operational and financial benchmarks  This 
non-interest bearing support facilitates the young but well performing 
MFIs to make long term institutional investments and acts as a constant 
incentive to transform themselves into formal and regulated entities 
f  Micro Enterprise Loans 
In order to build and strengthen new set of intermediaries for 
Micro Enterprise Loans  the Bank has formulated new scheme for Micro 
Enterprise Loans  Institutions  MFIs with minimum fund requirement 
of     lakh p a  and having considerable experience in financial 
intermediation  facilitating or setting up of enterprises  providing escort 
services to SSI  tiny units  networking or active interface with SSIs etc 
and having professional expertise and capability to handle on-lending 
transactions shall be eligible under the dispensation  The institutions 
would be selected based on their relevant experience  potential to expand 
professional management  transparency in operations and well laid-out 
systems besides qualified  trained manpower  Lending to be based strictly 
on an intensive in-house appraisal supplemented with the credit rating by 
an independent professional agency  Relaxed security norms more or less 
on line with micro credit dispensation to be adopted to reduce procedural 
bottlenecks as well as to facilitate easy disbursements 
Micro Enterprise Loans Scheme - Direct Credit 
The Micro Enterprise Loan Scheme - Direct Credit provides 
need based composite loan  ranging from   to   lakh   to Micro 
Enterprises directly for acquiring capital assets and also for their working 
capital   marketing related requirements  The assistance is covered under 
the CGTMSE scheme  The scheme is currently operated by the   specialized

Loan Syndication 
Keeping in view the increased fund requirement of major partner 
MFIs  the Bank has also undertaken fee based syndication arrangement 
where loan requirement is comparatively higher

CASE STUDY 
The Making of a Successful Microfinance Institution 
Vikram Akula  Akula  the founder of one of the world s fastest 
growing microfinance institution  MFI  SKS Microfinance Private Limited 
 SKS  was recognised by the Time magazine in its list of    people who 
shape our world  in   For Akula  who had left his job as a consultant 
at McKinsey to start SKS in India  the honour came as a recognition for 
the work done by SKS in providing microfinance to the poor in India  a 
country which is reported to have the highest number of operating MFIs 
Vikram Akula set up SKS Microfinance Pvt  Ltd   SKS  in   to provide 
microfinance to the poorest sections of the Indian society that earns a per 
 Notes 
capita less than INR     per year  Negating the traditional 
assumption that microcredit is not a viable business in developing 
countries  SKS has brought in a new micro financing model in India 
which is profitable and self-sustaining 
By reducing costs through prevention of wastage at each step of 
the loan process coupled with innovative technologies and an efficient 
management system  Akula has transformed SKS into one of the fastest 
growing microfinance institutions in the world  By attracting capital from 
global financial institutions like Citibank and through its automated MIS 
system and its award winning Smart Cards Pilot Project  SKS aims to 
grow at   per annum in the future SKS Microfinance follows the Joint 
Liability Group  JLG  model 
The methodology involves lending to individual women  using 
five  member groups as the ultimate guarantor for each member  Through 
group lending  situations of adverse selection and moral hazard due to 
asymmetric information are better managed Social collateral  replaces 
asset collateral  which is lacking in the poorer segments of society  Such 
a system works because India is still a highly community-centric society 
The concept of honour and respect within society is deeply rooted 
in Indian culture and willful default invites condescending glances 
humiliation and even ostracism  The company lists some of the social 
benefits of its financial product and service offerings as  providing self- 
employed women financial assistance to support their business enterprises 
such as raising livestock  running local retail shops called kirana stores 
providing tailoring and other assorted trade and services 
Question 
  Evaluate the micro financing model of SKS Micro Finance Pvt  Ltd 
along with the reasons for its success

Financial System 
The word  system  in the term  financial system  implies a set of 
complex and closely connected or interlined institutions  agents  practices 
markets  transactions  claims  and liabilities in the economy  The financial 
system is concerned about money  credit and finance-the three terms are 
intimately related yet are somewhat different from each other  Financial 
System deals about the arrangements that can be made for raising different 
types of funds required for the business so that the economic conditions 
of the country can improve  It is the functioning of a healthy financial 
 Notes 
system on which depends the business prospects of a country  With more 
expansion of business and production in the country  the service sector 
will improve and more employment opportunities will be created  The 
financial system helps the primary sector  the agriculture  secondary 
sector  the industry  and the service sector 
Besides  Financial System deals about  a  various financial 
institutions   b  with their financial services   c  financial markets which 
enable individual  business and government concerns to raise finance  and 
 d  various instruments issued in the financial markets for the purpose of 
raising financial resources 
Thus  financial system consists of 
     
Financial Markets 
     
Financial Instruments assets 
     
Financial Institutions intermediaries and their services 
Role of Financial System in Economic Development 
The economic development of a nation is reflected by the progress of 
the various economic units  broadly classified into corporate  government 
and household sector  While performing their activities  these units will 
be placed in a surplus  deficit  balanced budgetary situations  A financial 
system or financial sector functions as an intermediary and facilitates the 
flow of funds from the areas of surplus to the areas of deficit 
Thus  a Financial System is a composition of various institutions 
markets  regulations and laws  practices  money manager  analysts 
transactions and claims and liabilities  Economic growth and development 
of any country depends upon a well-knit financial system  Financial 
system comprises a set of sub-systems of financial institutions financial 
markets  financial instruments and services which help in the formation 
of capital  Thus a financial system provides a mechanism by which savings 
are transformed into investments and it can be said that financial system 
play an significant role in economic growth of the country by mobilizing 
surplus funds and utilizing them effectively for productive purpose 
 Notes 
The financial system is characterized by the presence of integrated 
organized and regulated financial markets  and institutions that meet 
the short term and long term financial needs of both the household and 
corporate sector  Both financial markets and financial institutions play 
an important role in the financial system by rendering various financial 
services to the community  They operate in close combination with each 
other 
Functions of Financial System 
A financial system performs the following functions 
a  Increase the Savings 
     
It provides a measure for managing and controlling the risk involved 
in mobilizing savings and allocating credit 
     
It promotes the process of capital formation by bringing together 
the supply of saving and the demand for investible funds 
     
It helps in lowering the cost of transaction and increase returns 
b  Mobilization of Savings 
     
It is a link between savers and investors  It utilizes mobilized savings 
of savers  who are not organized  scattered  in more efficient and 
effective manner 
     
It provides payment mechanism for exchange of goods and services 
     
It facilitate for the transfer of resources across geographic 
boundaries 
     
It provides detailed information to the operators  players in the 
market such as individuals  business houses  Governments etc 
c  Proper Investment 
     
It assists in the selection of the projects to be financed and also 
reviews the performance of such projects time to time 
     
It channelizes flow of saving into productive investment 
 Indian Financial System 
India s financial system is a very strong and efficient one which is 
evidenced by India s flourishing stock markets  fast-growing mutual funds 
and capable banking sector 
Indian financial system consists of financial market  financial

Shortcomings of Indian Financial System 
The Indian financial system s shortcomings fall largely into three areas 
     
First  formal financial institutions attract only half of India s 
household savings 
     
Second  these financial institutions allocate more than half of 
the capital to the economy s least productive areas  state-owned 
enterprises  SOEs  agriculture  and the unorganized sector  made 
up mostly of tiny businesses 
     
Third  since the financial system is inefficient in both of its main 
task mobilizing savings and allocating capital  Indian borrowers 
pay more for capital and depositors receive less than they do in 
comparable economies 
 Notes 
Review of Indian Financial System 
Saving Trends 
India has a surprisingly small share of the economy s total capital 
despite a  -year-old stock market  a long history of private banks  and 
generally well-developed public institutions  The relative shallowness of the 
financial system  measured by comparing the value of all Indian financial 
assets with GDP  exemplifies the problem  The country s financial depth is 
significantly lower than that of other Asian economies  notably China  The 
detailed examination revealed how much saving and investment occurs 
outside the formal financial system  The country s households save  
percent of their disposable income at a very high rate by international 
standards but invest only half of these savings in bank deposits and other 
financial assets 
Of the other half  they invest   percent in housing and put the 
remainder into machinery and equipment for the   million tiny household 
enterprises that make up the economy s unorganized sector  As a result 
Indian households account for   percent of the economy s total physical 
investment  a surprisingly high proportion  Yet with a few exceptions 
household businesses are below efficient scale  lack technology and 
business know-how  and have low levels of productivity  Indian households 
bought more than   billion worth of gold  arguably another form of 
nonfinancial savings  They are now the world s largest consumers of gold 
India s economy would grow faster if the financial system attracted more 
of the country s savings and channelled them into larger  more productive 
enterprises 
Finance to the Least Productive Investments 
India s financial system is better at allocating capital than are 
its counterparts in many other emerging markets  It has some high- 
performing private and foreign banks  and its stock of non-performing 
loans is manageable  It has well-run equity markets that list mostly 
private companies and a dynamic private corporate sector that includes 
some world-class competitors  especially in business process outsourcing 
information technology  and research and development 
 Notes 
The private corporate sector  as the most productive part of the 
economy  should be the main recipient of funding from the financial 
system  But most of the funding goes to the government and to investments 
it designates as priorities  Private corporations receive just   percent of 
the country s total commercial credit and that level hasn t increased since 
  The rest goes to SOEs  agriculture  and the tiny businesses in the 
unorganized sector  This pattern of capital allocation impedes growth 
because SOEs are  on average  only half as productive as private ones and 
require twice as much investment to achieve the same additional output 
Productivity in the agricultural and unorganized sectors is only one- 
tenth as high as it is in India s modern private sector  and their investment 
efficiency is commensurately low 
Reforms that enabled the financial system to channel a larger 
portion of the available credit to private companies would raise the 
economy s productivity  State-owned companies and household enterprises 
would then have to improve their operations to compete successfully for 
financing  If such reforms were accompanied by complementary reforms 
to India s labour and product markets  the country would get more output 
for each rupee invested 
Government Control 
The government s tight control of the financial system explains its 
poor allocation of capital  Regulations oblige banks and other intermediaries 
to direct a high proportion of their funding to the government and its 
priority investments  Banks must hold   percent of their assets in 
government bonds  and in practice the state-owned banks that dominate 
the sector choose to hold even more  Government policies require banks 
to direct   percent of their loans to agriculture  household businesses 
and other priority sectors  Directed loans have relatively high default rates 
and are costly to administer because of their small size  Besides diverting 
credit from the more productive private sector  these policies reduce the 
overall level of lending  since the unprofitable directed loans of banks 
must expand in proportion to their discretionary loans  Banks therefore 
lend just   percent of their deposits  compared with   percent for Thai 
  percent for South Korean  and   percent for Chinese banks 
 Notes 
The government maintains strict controls on the financial system 
to achieve social-welfare objectives  such as ensuring that credit flows to 
rural areas and keeping levels of public-sector employment robust  It also 
uses these policies to finance a persistently large budget deficit 
Overcoming the Political Obstacles 
Some of India s regulators understandably resist reform of the 
financial system because they fear that change involves risks and political 
trade-offs  They worry  for instance  that the abolition of directed lending 
would stifle growth in the rural economy and thus potentially increase 
unemployment in the countryside  But India s rural poor  as well as its 
entrepreneurs  would be better served if the financial system could freely 
allocate all available capital to more productive businesses capable of 
creating jobs  These extra revenues would help the government control 
its deficit and still leave money for social programs to support rural living 
standards  which would no longer have to be maintained by diverting 
capital from the financial system  If its total liberalization seems a step 
too far  the government could  as a transitional measure  promote bank 
lending to the priority areas by providing market-based incentives  such 
as tax breaks or subsidies  rather than by fiat 
Costly Intermediary 
The government s influence on the financial system also lowers 
its efficiency and raises the cost of financial intermediation  Apart from 
China  India now has the highest level of state ownership of banks in any 
major economy and even China is now seeking foreign investment in 
most of its major commercial banks  The prevalence of state-owned banks 
means that they experience little competitive pressure to improve the way 
they operate  They meet their costs by maintaining high margins between 
their lending and deposit rates  If India developed a vibrant corporate- 
bond market and the financial system offered the mix of bonds and bank 
loans seen in other emerging economies  companies large and small would 
enjoy substantially lower funding costs  Even India s flourishing equity 
markets are constrained by heavy regulation elsewhere in the financial 
sector  These markets would have still greater success if domestic financial 
intermediaries  with their long-term mind-set  held more shares  but they 
are now required to invest in government bonds 
 Notes 
Key Reforms 
An integrated program to reform the financial system could 
substantially raise India s growth rate  If the system improved its allocation 
of capital  captured more savings  and reduced its operating inefficiencies 
the country s real GDP could expand  Since many problems of India s 
financial system cut across its markets  the government must carefully 
integrate the necessary reforms  which will primarily affect the banking 
sector  the corporate-bond market  and domestic institutional investors  To 
achieve the full potential  reforms in one area will require complementary 
changes in others for instance  changes in capital account and foreign- 
investment policies 
Financial Intermediation 
The term financial intermediary may refer to an institution 
firm or individual who performs intermediation between two or more 
parties in a financial context  Typically the first party is a provider of 
a product or service and the second party is a consumer or customer 
Financial intermediaries are banking and non-banking institutions which 
transfer funds from economic agents with surplus funds  surplus units  to 
economic agents  deficit units  that would like to utilize those funds  FIs 
are basically two types 
Bank Financial Intermediaries  BFIs - Central banks and 
Commercial banks  and Non-Bank Financial Intermediaries  NBFIs - 
insurance companies  mutual trust funds  investment companies  pensions 
funds  discount houses and forex agencies  Financial intermediaries can 
be Banks  Financial adviser or broker  Insurance Companies  life and 
non-life  Mutual Funds and Pension Funds  The borrower who borrows 
money from the Financial Intermediaries Institutions pays higher amount 
of interest than that received by the actual lender and the difference 
between the Interest paid and Interest earned is the profit for Financial 
Intermediaries Institutions 
Financial Intermediaries are broadly classified into two major 
categories 
  Fee-based or Advisory Financial Intermediaries 
  Asset Based Financial Intermediaries 
 Notes 
Fee-Based Advisory Financial Intermediaries 
These Financial Intermediaries  Institutions offer advisory 
financial services and charge a fee accordingly for the services rendered 
Their services include Issue Management  Underwriting  Portfolio 
Management  Corporate Counseling  Stock Broking  Syndicated Credit 
Arranging Foreign Collaboration Services  Mergers and Acquisitions 
Debenture Trusteeship and Capital Restructuring 
Asset-Based Financial Intermediaries 
These Financial Intermediaries Institutions  finance the specific 
requirements of their clientele  The required infra-structure  in the form 
of required asset or finance is provided for rent or interest respectively 
The financial institutions may be regulated by various regulatory 
authorities  In addition  regulatory authorities may impose specific 
standards of conduct requirements on financial intermediaries when 
providing services to investors 
Role of Financial Intermediaries 
Micro Finance 
Finding innovative ways to provide financial services to the poor 
so that they can improve their productive capacity and quality of life is the 
role of the financial intermediaries in the   st century  Most of the poor 
live in the rural areas  and are engaged in agricultural activities or a variety 
of micro-enterprises  The poor are vulnerable to income fluctuations and 
hence are exposed to risk  They are unable to access conventional credit 
and insurance markets to offset this  Providing efficient micro-finance to 
the poor is important  Efficient provision of savings  credit and insurance 
facilities can enable the poor to smoothen their consumption  manage 
risks better  gradually build assets  develop micro-enterprises  enhance 
income earning capacity  and generally enjoy an improved quality of life 
Efficient micro-finance services can also contribute to improvement of 
resource allocation  development of financial markets and system  and 
ultimately economic growth and development 
 Notes 
Restructuring of Assets 
Financial intermediaries appear to have a key role in the 
restructuring and liquidation of firms in distress  In particular  there 
is rich evidence that financial intermediaries play an active role in the 
reallocation of displaced capital  meant both as the piece-meal reallocation 
of assets and  more broadly as the sale of entire bankrupt corporations to 
healthy ones 
Pension Funds 
Pension funds may be defined as forms of institutional investor 
which collect pool and invest funds contributed by sponsors and 
beneficiaries to provide for the future pension entitlements of beneficiaries 
They thus provide means for individuals to accumulate saving over their 
working life so as to finance their consumption needs in retirement  either 
by means of a lump sum or by provision of an annuity  while also supplying 
funds to end-users such as corporations  other households  via securitized 
loans  or governments for investment or consumption

Learning Objectives 
     
To understand the components  operations and benefits of financial 
markets 
     
To understand the need  role and functioning of primary market 
     
To understand the functioning of secondary market 
Financial Markets 
In the last lesson  you have studied the components of Indian 
financial system and understood that financial market is one of the 
components 
Financial market is a place or a system where financial assets or 
instruments are created and exchanged by market participants  One of the 
barometers to measure the economic health of a nation is to look at the 
efficiency of the financial market of the country  Financial markets play a 
significant role in performing the resource management in an economy 
through various financial assets namely equity  debt  currency and other 
quasi instruments  Financial markets facilitate the price discovery and 
provide liquidity of financial assets  Financial market performs the crucial 
role of capital creation that is acting as a bridge between providers of 
finance and the seekers of finance 
The financial assets  also called financial claims or financial 
securities are issued by the seekers of finance  They issue the instruments 
to investors who have surplus money to invest  Between the two parties 
there are financial intermediaries who act who act as conduits between the 
investors and issuers  Thus  there are four important elements of securities 
markets namely investors  issuers  intermediaries and regulators  The 
issuers can be government or corporate houses  The government issues 
gilt- edged securities whereas the corporate issue shares  debentures 
etc  depending on the time period for which the fund is required  and 
the financial instruments could be short term and long term  Depending 
 Notes 
on the participants  the financial markets are classified as primary and 
secondary market 
Components of Financial Markets 
a  Money market 
The money market is a wholesale debt market for low-risk  highly- 
liquid  short-term instruments  Funds are available in this market for 
periods ranging from a single day up to a year  This market is dominated 
mostly by government  banks and financial institutions  The following are 
the money market instruments 
     
Call Notice Money 
     
Treasury Bills 
     
Term Money 
     
Certificate of Deposit 
     
Commercial Papers 
i 
Call  Notice-Money Market  Call Notice money is the money 
borrowed or lent on demand for a very short period  When money 
is borrowed or lent for a day  it is known as Call  Overnight 
Money  Intervening holidays and or Sunday are excluded for this 
purpose  Thus money  borrowed on a day and repaid on the next 
working day   irrespective of the number of intervening holidays 
is  Call Money  When money is borrowed or lent for more than a 
day and up to   days  it is  Notice Money  No collateral security 
is required to cover these transactions 
ii  Inter-Bank Term Money  Inter-bank market for deposits of 
maturity beyond   days is referred to as the term money market 
The entry restrictions are the same as those for Call Notice Money 
except that  as per existing regulations  the specified entities are 
not allowed to lend beyond   days 
iii  Treasury Bills  Treasury Bills are short term  up to one year 
borrowing instruments of the union government  It is an IOU 
of the Government  It is a promise by the Government to pay a 
stated sum after expiry of the stated period from the date of issue 
  days i e  less than one year  They are issued at a 
 Notes 
discount to the face value  and on maturity the face value is paid to 
the holder  The rate of discount and the corresponding issue price 
are determined at each auction 
iv  Certificate of Deposits  Certificates of Deposit  CDs  is a 
negotiable money market instrument issued in dematerialized 
form or as a Usuance Promissory Note  for funds deposited at a 
bank or other eligible financial institution for a specified time 
period  Guidelines for issue of CDs are presently governed by 
various directives issued by the Reserve Bank of India  as amended 
from time to time  CDs can be issued by 
a  scheduled commercial banks excluding Regional Rural Banks 
 RRBs  and Local Area Banks  LABs  and 
b  Select all-India Financial Institutions that have been permitted 
by RBI to raise short-term resources within the umbrella limit 
fixed by RBI  Banks have the freedom to issue CDs depending 
on their requirements  An FI may issue CDs within the overall 
umbrella limit fixed by RBI  i e  issue of CD together with other 
instruments viz  term money  term deposits  commercial papers 
and inter corporate deposits should not exceed   per cent of 
its net owned funds  as per the latest audited balance sheet 
v 
Commercial Paper  CP is a note in evidence of the debt obligation 
of the issuer  CP is thus an innovative unsecured promissory 
note privately placed with investors at a discount rate to face 
value determined by market forces  CP is freely negotiable by 
endorsement and delivery  A company shall be eligible to issue CP 
provided - 
a The tangible net worth of the company  as per the latest audited 
balance sheet  is not less than   crore 
b The working capital  fund-based  limit of the company from 
the banking system is not less than   crore and 
c The borrowed account of the company is classified as a Standard 
Asset by the financing bank s  The minimum maturity period 
of CP is   days  The minimum credit rating shall be P-  of 
CRISIL or such equivalent rating by other agencies 
 Notes 
b  Capital Market 
Now let us look into the capital market which mainly involves 
creation of long term instruments  The capital market generally consists 
of the long term financial instruments  The instruments used in the equity 
segment include equity shares  preference shares  convertible preference 
shares  non-convertible preference shares  etc  and in the debt segment 
include debentures  zero coupon bonds  deep discount bonds  etc  Section 
  of the Companies Act    permits public limited companies  having 
share capital  to have two kinds of shares namely - equity and preference 
The various capital market instruments are explained below 
i 
Equity share capital  An equity interest in a company may be said 
to represent a share of the company s assets and a share of any 
profits earned on those assets after other claims have been met  The 
equity shareholders are the owners of the business  they purchase 
shares  the money is used by the company to buy assets  the assets 
are used to earn profits  which belong to the ordinary shareholders 
After satisfying the rights of preference shares  the equity shares 
shall be entitled to share in the remaining amount of distributable 
net profits of the company  The dividend on equity shares is not 
fixed and may vary from year to year depending upon the amount 
of profits available  The rate of dividend is recommended by the 
Board of Directors of the company and declared by shareholders 
in the Annual General Meeting  Equity shareholders have a right 
to vote on every resolution placed in the meeting and the voting 
rights shall be in proportion to the paid-up capital  Equity capital 
can either be  i  With voting rights  or  ii  with differential rights 
as to dividend  voting or otherwise in accordance with such rules 
and subject to such conditions as may be prescribed 
 ii  Preference share capital  Preference share is a hybrid security 
because it has features of both ordinary shares and bonds 
Preference shareholders have preferential rights in respect of 
assets and dividends  In the event of winding up the preference 
shareholders have a claim on available assets before the ordinary 
shareholders  In addition  preference shareholders get their stated 
dividend before equity shareholders can receive any dividends  The 
dividends on preference shares are fixed and they must be declared 
 Notes 
before a legal obligation exists to pay them  The fixed nature of 
dividend is similar to that of interest on debentures and bonds 
The declaration feature is similar to that of equity shareholders 
dividends  The general forms of preference shares are as follows 
     
Cumulative and Non-cumulative Preference Shares  The 
cumulative preference share gives a right to demand the unpaid 
dividend of any year  during the subsequent years when the 
profits are ample 
     
Cumulative Convertible Preference Shares  The cumulative 
convertible preference  CCP  share is an instrument that 
embraces features of both equity shares and preference shares 
but which essentially is a preference share  The CCPs are 
convertible into equity shares at a future specified date at a 
predetermined conversion rate once it is converted into equity 
shares  it passes all the characteristics of an equity share 
     
Participating and Non-participating Preference Shares 
Participating preference shares are those shares which are 
entitled to a fixed preferential dividend and  in addition  carry 
a right to participate in the surplus profits along with equity 
shareholders after dividend at a certain rate has been paid to 
equity shareholders 
     
Redeemable and Irredeemable Preference Shares  Subject 
to an authority in the articles of association  a public limited 
company may issue redeemable preference shares to be 
redeemed either at a fixed date or after a certain period of 
time during the life time of the company  The Companies 
Act    prohibits the issue of any preference share which is 
irredeemable or is redeemable after the expiry of a period of 
twenty years from the date of issue 
iii  Deferred Founders Shares  A private company may issue deferred 
or founder s shares  Such shares are normally held by promoters 
and directors of the company  That is why they are usually 
called  founders shares  These shares are usually of a smaller 
denomination  say one rupee each  However they are generally 
given equal voting rights with equity shares which may be of higher 
denomination  say   each  Thus  by investing relatively lower 
 Notes 
amounts  the promoters may gain control over the management 
of the company  As regards the payment of dividends to holders of 
such shares  the articles usually provide that these shares will carry 
a dividend fixed in relation to the profits available after dividends 
have been declared on the preference and equity shares 
iv  Sweat Equity Shares  Under section  A of the Companies Act 
  a company can issue sweat equity shares to its employees 
or directors at discount or for consideration other than cash for 
providing knowhow or making available rights in the nature of 
intellectual property rights or value addition etc 
c  Hybrid Market and Instruments 
Hybrid instruments have both the features of equity and debenture 
This kind of instruments is called as hybrid instruments  Examples are 
convertible debentures  warrants etc  Financing from capital markets - 
There are two ways a company can raise money from the financial markets 
namely - Debt and Equity 
i 
Foreign Exchange Market  Forex Market  The third important 
element of financial market is the forex market  The Forex market 
deals with the multicurrency requirements  which are met by the 
exchange of currencies  Depending on the exchange rate that is 
applicable  the transfer of funds takes place in this market  This 
is one of the most developed and integrated market across the 
globe  In India till  -  the forex market had been highly 
regulated as the government had strict import- export policy 
The erstwhile FERA  Foreign exchange regulation Act  enacted 
in   acted tough on foreign exchange violations  From  
onwards  India brought in number of policy changes with respect 
to Foreign Direct Investment  FDI  foreign portfolio investments 
and other aspects of trade  One of the important milestones was 
the current account convertibility of INR  Indian Rupees  That 
would mean the foreign exchange payments and receipts can be 
converted at market determined rate such that individuals and 
companies have the freedom to transact in foreign currency for 
non-capital creation activities such as foreign travel  medical 
expenses  business expenses etc  contrasting to current account 
 Notes 
convertibility is the capital account convertibility which involve 
creation of long term assets like house properties  loan etc  Even 
though the exchange rate has been market determined  from 
time to time RBI intervenes in spot and forward market  if it feels 
exchange rate has deviated too much 
Financial Intermediaries in the Financial Market 
The financial intermediaries are operating both in organized and 
unorganized sectors  The unorganized sector of the Indian financial 
market consists mainly of Indigenous bankers  money lenders  Nidhi s 
and chit funds  Some of the important intermediaries operating in the 
financial markets include  investment bankers  underwriters  stock 
exchanges  registrars  depositories  custodians  portfolio managers 
mutual funds  financial advisors  financial consultants  primary dealers 
satellite dealers  self regulatory organizations  etc  Though the markets are 
different  there may be a few intermediaries offering their services in more 
than one market  e g  underwriter  However  the services offered by them 
vary from one market to another  The Table below analyzes the various 
intermediaries and their role

Primary Markets 
Having learnt the difference between money market and capital 
market  let us move to primary market which is one of the components of 
capital market  Capital market is the place where long term requirements 
of funds are met by issuing various instruments  The Primary market is 
the segment in which new issues are made whereas secondary market is 
the segment in which outstanding securities are traded  It is for this reason 
that the Primary Market is also called new issues market or IPO  Initial 
Public Offer FPO  Follow on Public Offer  market and the Secondary 
market is called Stock Market  New issue market is not only a platform 
for raising finance to establish new enterprises but also for expansion  
diversification   modernizations of existing units  The issues of shares by 
the company can be classified as 
 a  IPO  Initial Public Offer 
 b  FPO  Follow on Public Offer 
Functions of New Issue Market Primary Market 
The main function of new issue market is to facilitate transfer of 
resources from savers to the users  The savers are individuals  commercial 
banks  insurance companies  public limited companies and the government 
The new issue market plays an important role of mobilizing the funds from 
the savers and transfers them to borrowers for production purposes  an 
important requisite of economic growth  The main function of new issue 
market can be divided into a triple service functions 
 a  Origination 
 b  Underwriting 
 c  Distribution 
Origination 
Origination refers to the work of investigation  analysis and 
processing of new project proposals  Origination starts before an issue 
is actually floated in the market  Technical  economic and financial 
viability are studied at this stage to ensure soundness of the project  This 
is a preliminary investigation undertaken by the sponsors of the issue 
 Notes 
Other advisory services depending of type of issue are provided such as 
magnitude  time of floating  price  methods and techniques of selling are 
provided at this stage of an issue  These services improve the quality of the 
issue 
Underwriting 
Underwriting is an agreement whereby the underwriter promises 
to subscribe to a specified number of shares or debentures or a specified 
amount of stock in the event of public not subscribing to the issue  If the 
issue is fully subscribed then there is no liability for the underwriter  If a 
part of share issues remain unsold  the underwriter will buy the shares 
Thus underwriting is a guarantee for the marketability of shares 
Method of Underwriting 
An underwriting agreement may take any of the following three forms 
 i 
Standing behind the issue  Under this method  the underwriter 
guarantees the sale of a specified number of shares within a 
specified period  If the public do not subscribe to the specified 
amount of issue  the underwriter buys the balance in the issue 
 ii  Outright purchase  The Underwriter  in this method  makes 
outright purchase of shares and resale them to the investors 
 iii  Consortium method  Underwriting is jointly done by a group of 
underwriters in this method  The underwriters form a syndicate 
for this purpose  This method is adopted for large issue 
Advantages of Underwriting 
Underwriting assumes great significance as it offers the following 
advantages to the issuing company 
     
The issuing company is relieved from the risk of finding buyers for 
the issue offered to the public  The company is assured of raising 
adequate capital 
     
The company is assured of getting minimum subscription within 
the stipulated time  a statutory obligation to be fulfilled by the 
issuing company 
 Notes 
     
Underwriters undertake the burden of highly specialized function 
of distributing securities 
     
Provide expert advice with regard to timing of security issue  the 
pricing of issue  the size and type of securities to be issued etc 
     
Public confidence on the issue enhances when underwritten by 
reputed underwriters 
The underwriters in India may be classified into two categories 
     
Institutional underwriters 
     
Non   institutional underwriters 
The Institutional Underwriters are 
     
Life Insurance Corporation of India  LIC 
     
Unit Trust of India  UTI 
     
Industrial Development Bank of India  IDBI 
     
Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India  ICICI 
     
Commercial banks and general insurance companies 
The pattern of underwriting of the above institutional underwriters 
differs vastly in India  LIC and UTI have purchased industrial securities 
from the new issue market with a view to hold them on their own 
portfolio  They have a preference for underwriting shares in large and well 
established firms  The development banks have given special attention to 
the issues in backward states and industries in the priority list  The thrust 
of the development banks is also towards small and new issues which do 
not have adequate support from other institutions  General insurance 
companies have shown preference in underwriting the securities of fairly 
new issues 
The non-institutional underwriters are brokers  They guarantee 
shares only with a view to earn commission from the company floating 
the issue  They are known to-off load the shares later to make a profit  The 
brokers work profit motive in underwriting industrial securities  After the 
elimination of forward trading  stock exchange broker has begun to take 
an underwritten to the total private capital issue varies between   percent 
to   percent 
 Notes 
Distribution 
Distribution is the function of sale of securities to ultimate investors 
This service is performed by brokers and agents who maintain regular and 
direct contact with the ultimate investors 
Methods of floating of new issues  The various methods which are 
used in the floating of securities in the new issue market are 
     
Public issues 
     
Offer for sale 
     
Placement 
     
Rights issues 
The following figure shows the classification of issues

i 
Public issues  Under this method  the issuing company directly 
offers to the general public institutions a fixed number of shares 
at a stated price through a document called prospectus  This is 
the most common method followed by join stock companies to 
raise capital through the issues of securities  According to the 
companies act    every application form must be accompanied 
by a prospectus  Now  it is no longer necessary to furnish a copy 
of the prospectus along with every application forms as per the 
companies Amendment Act    Now  an abridged prospectus is 
being annexed to every share application form 
 Notes 
Merits of Issue Through Prospectus 
     
Sale through prospectus has the advantage of inviting a large section 
of the investing public through advertisement 
     
It is a direct method and no intermediaries are involved in it 
     
Shares  under this method  are allotted to a large section of 
investors on a non-discriminatory basis  This procedure helps in 
wide dispersion of shares and to avoid concentration of wealth in 
few hands 
Demerits of Issue Through Prospectus 
     
It is an expensive method  The company has to incur expenses 
on printing of prospectus  advertisement  banks  commission 
underwriting commission  legal charges  stamp duty  listing fees 
and registration charges 
     
This method is suitable only for large issues 
ii  Offer for sale  The method of offer of sale constitute outright sale 
of securities through the intermediary of issue houses or share 
brokers  In other words  the shares are not offered to the public 
directly  This method consist of two stages  the first stage is a 
direct sale by the issuing company to the issue house and brokers 
at an agreed price  In the second stage  the intermediaries resell 
the above securities to the ultimate investors  The issue houses 
or stock brokers purchase the securities at a negotiated price and 
resell at a higher price  The difference in the purchase and sale 
price is called turn or spread 
Advantages  The advantages of this method are that the company 
is relieved from the problem of printing and advertisement of prospectus 
and making allotment of shares  Offer of sale is not common in India  This 
method is used generally in two instances 
     
Offer by a foreign company of a part of it to Indian investors 
     
Promoters diluting their stake to comply with requirements of stock 
exchange at the time of listing of shares 
iii  Follow on Public Offering  FPO  When an existing listed 
company either makes a fresh issue of securities to the public or 
 Notes 
makes an offer for sale of securities to the public for the first time 
through an offer document  such issues are called as  Follow on 
Public Offering  Such public issue of securities or offer for sale to 
public is required to satisfy the stock exchange listing obligations 
along with SEBI guidelines 
iv  Rights Issue  RI  When a listed company proposes to issue 
securities to its existing shareholders  whose names appear in the 
register of members on record date  in the proportion to their 
existing holding  through an offer document  such issues are called 
 Rights Issue  This mode of raising capital is best suited when the 
dilution of controlling interest is not intended 
v 
Preferential Issue  A preferential issue is an issue of equity shares 
or of convertible securities by listed companies to a select group of 
persons which is neither a rights issue nor a public issue  The issuer 
company has to comply with the provisions of the Companies Act 
as well as  SEBI s guidelines with reference to preferential issues  A 
company which makes any public or rights issue or an offer for sale 
can issue shares only in dematerialized form  A company shall not 
make a public or rights issue of shares unless all the existing partly 
paid shares have been fully paid-up or forfeited  A company which 
is making public issue of securities shall make an application to 
the stock exchange for listing of those shares 
Book Building 
It is a capital issuance process which results towards a price 
discovery and also to assess demand analysis of the security  It is a process 
used for marketing equity shares of a company  The book building process 
includes the following steps 
     
The Issuer nominates a merchant banker as book runner 
     
Specifies issue size and floor price 
     
Appoints syndicate members 
     
Investors place orders into the electronic book  termed as the 
process of bidding   Bids are entered   at  or  above  the floor price 
     
Retail investors can bid at a cut-off price 
     
The price opted by majority of bidders shall be decided as the 
subscription price

promoters  contribution through the offer document  shall not 
exceed five   times its pre-issue net worth 
In case an unlisted company does not satisfy any of the above criteria 
it can come out with a public issue only through the Book-Building process

sixty percent   of the issue size to the Qualified Institutional Buyers 
 QIBs  failing which the full subscription monies shall be refunded 
     
If change in name  at least   revenue for preceding   year should 
be from the new activity 
     
The issue size does not exceed   times the pre-issue net worth 
To provide sufficient flexibility and also to ensure that genuine 
companies do not suffer on account of rigidity of the parameters  SEBI has 
provided two other alternative routes to company not satisfying any of the 
above conditions  for accessing the primary market 
Entry Norm II 
     
Issue shall be through book building route  with at least   to be 
mandatorily allotted to the Qualified Institutional Buyers  QIBs 
     
The minimum post-issue face value capital shall be   crores or 
there shall be a compulsory market-making for at least   years or 
Entry Norm III 
     
The  project  is appraised and participated to the extent of   by 
FIs Scheduled commercial banks of which at least   comes from 
the appraiser s 
     
The minimum post-issue face value capital shall be   crores or 
there shall be a compulsory market-making for at least   years In 
addition to satisfying the aforesaid eligibility norms  the company 
shall also satisfy the criteria of having at least   prospective 
allottees in its issue 
Green Shoe Option 
Green Shoe Option denotes  an option of allocating shares in 
excess of the shares included in the public issue  It is an option allowing 
the Issuing Company to issue additional shares when the demand is high 
for the shares when the flotation is on  SEBI guidelines allows the Issuing 
company to accept oversubscription  subject to a ceiling  say   of the 
offer made to public  In certain cases  the Green Shoe Option can be even 
more than   It is extensively used in international IPOs to stabilize the 
 Notes 
post listing price of new issued shares  The concept has been introduced 
in the Indian capital market and is used in initial public offerings through 
book building process  SEBI has allowed the use of the option with a view to 
boost the investors  confidence and to put a check for speculative practices 
causing short-term volatility in post listing price  The Green Shoe Option 
facility would bring in price stability of initial public offerings 
Kinds of Offer Documents 
An offer document means  prospectus  in case of a public issue or an 
offer for sale and  Letter of offer  in case of rights issue  which is required 
to be filed with the Registrar of Companies  ROC  and Stock Exchanges 
An offer document covers all the relevant information to help an investor 
in making wise investment decisions 
Draft Prospectus 
A company before making any public issue of securities shall file a 
draft prospectus with SEBI  through an eligible merchant banker  at least 
  days prior to the filing of prospectus with the Registrar of Companies 
If any specific changes are suggested by SEBI within the said   days  the 
Issuing Company or the lead merchant banker shall carryout such changes 
in the draft prospectus before filing the prospectus with ROC 
Draft Letter of Offer 
A listed company  before making any rights issue for an amount 
exceeding   lakhs  including premium  shall file a draft letter of offer 
with SEBI  at least   days prior to the filing of the letter of offer with 
regional stock exchange and shall carry changes as suggested by SEBI 
before the filing of the draft letter of offer with regional stock exchange 
Prospectus 
A company issuing shares to public must issue a  prospectus  The 
prospectus is an  invitation  to offer  It is an invitation to the public to take 
shares or debentures in the company or deposit money in the company 
Section   of the Companies Act    defines prospectus as  any 
document described or issued as a prospectus and includes any notice 
circular  advertisement or other document inviting deposits from the 
 Notes 
public or inviting offers from the public for the subscription or purchase 
of any shares in  or debentures of  a body corporate 
Abridged Prospectus 
Section   of the Companies Act    defines abridged 
prospectus means  a memorandum containing such salient features of 
a prospectus as may be prescribed  An abridged prospectus means the 
memorandum as prescribed in Form  A under sub-section   of section 
  of the Companies Act  It contains all the salient features of a prospectus 
A company cannot supply application forms for shares or debentures 
unless the form is accompanied by abridged prospectus 
Shelf Prospectus 
Sometimes  securities are issued in stages spread over a period of 
time  particularly in respect of infrastructure projects where issue size is 
large as huge funds have to be collected  In such cases  filing of prospectus 
each time will be very expensive  In such cases  section  A of the 
Companies Act    allows a prospectus called  Shelf Prospectus  to be 
filed with Registrar of Companies  At subsequent stages only  Information 
Memorandum  is required to be filed  The shelf prospectus shall be valid 
for a period of   year from the date of opening of first issue of securities 
under that prospectus 
Information Memorandum 
The Information Memorandum shall contain all material facts 
relating to new charges created  changes in the financial position as 
have accrued between the first offer  previous offer and the succeeding 
offer  The Information Memorandum shall be filed with a period of  
months prior to making of second or subsequent offer of securities under 
Shelf Prospectus  The Information Memorandum shall be issued to the 
public along with Shelf Prospectus filed at the first stage of offer  Where 
an update of Information Memorandum is filed every time an offer of 
securities is made  such memorandum together with the Shelf Prospectus 
shall constitute the Prospectus 
 Notes 
Red-Herring Prospectus 
A prospectus is said to be a red-herring prospectus which contains 
all information as per prospectus contents but does not have information 
on price of securities offered and number of securities  quantum  offered 
through such document  Thus  a red-herring prospectus lacks price and 
quantity of the securities offered  This is used in book building issues 
only  In the case of book built issues  it is a process of price discovery 
and the price cannot be determined until bidding process is completed 
Hence  such details are not shown in Red-herring prospectus filed with 
ROC in terms of the provisions of the Companies Act  Only on completion 
of the bidding process  the details of the final price are included in the 
offer document  The offer document filed thereafter with ROC is called a 
 prospectus 
Secondary Markets 
Secondary market  popularly known as stock exchange is the place 
where the issued shares and other instruments are traded for subsequent 
sale  One of the criteria in investment management which is considered as 
very important next to risk assessment is the liquidity  After the investors 
get the shares allotted through the primary market they need some platform 
or market place to provide liquidity for their investment  Thus  secondary 
market offers liquidity to investment made in the primary market  Both 
primary and secondary markets co-exist  i e  to say one depends on the 
other for its survival and growth 
There are two broad segments of the stock markets 
     
The organised stock exchanges and 
     
The Over-the-Counter  OTC  market 
The primary middlemen in the stock market are brokers and 
dealers  The distinction between them is  the broker acts as an agent 
whereas the dealer acts as a principal in the transaction  Stock markets are 
said to reflect the overall health of the country s economy  On the other 
hand  major economic indicators determine stock market movements to a 
large extent  From a thorough analysis of the various economic indicators 
and its implications on the stock markets  it is known that stock market 
 Notes 
movements are largely influenced by broad money supply  inflation  credit 
deposit ratio and fiscal deficit apart from political stability 
Besides  fundamentals  factors like corporate performance 
industrial growth  etc  always exert a certain amount of influence on the 
stock markets  Because the stock market involves the trading of securities 
initially sold in the primary market  it is providing liquidity to the 
individuals who acquired these securities  The trends in stock market will 
have impact on the primary market 
The secondary market in India comprises of   Stock Exchanges 
and more than   listed companies out of which BSE has about  
and NSE has  companies listed with them as on  th February  
A large volume of transactions on the secondary markets are transacted 
through BSE and NSE  Presently  the BSE   NSE put together account for 
more than   of the total turnover as compared to less than   by the 
other Stock Exchanges 
Role of Secondary Market 
There are two main reasons why individuals transact in the 
secondary market  Information Motivated Reasons  Information 
motivated investors believe that they have superior information about 
a particular security than other market participants  This information 
leads them to believe that the security is not being correctly priced by 
the market  If the information is good  this suggests that the security is 
currently under-priced  and investors with access to such information will 
want to buy the security  On the other hand  if the information is bad  the 
security will be currently overpriced  and such investors will want to sell 
their holdings of the security 
Liquidity Motivated Reasons  Liquidity motivated investors  on the 
other hand  transact in the secondary market because they are currently in 
a position of either excess or insufficient liquidity  Investors with surplus 
cash holdings  e g  as a result of an inheritance or adequate savings of 
their income  will buy securities  where as investors with insufficient cash 
 e g  to purchase a car or any other assets  will sell their securities 
 Notes 
Types of Securities in the Stock Market 
The Securities which are traded in the secondary market may be 
classified as follows 
On the Basis of Issuer 
Securities may be classified as Industrial securities  Government 
securities and financial intermediaries securities 
a   
Industrial securities issued by industrial and common undertakings 
in the private and public sector whereas government securities 
include securities issued by State governments  municipalities and 
public utilities 
b   
Government securities are generally considered risk-free  low return 
securities compared to the Industrial securities 
c   
Financial Intermediaries Securities  Besides these two classes of 
issues  the Financial Intermediaries are emerging as the third 
important group  The securities issued by Financial Institutions 
and Banks would fall  in terms of risk-return features  somewhere 
in between the industrial securities and government securities 
On the Basis of Maturity 
Securities may be classified into short term and long term or 
Money Market and Capital Market securities  Treasury bills  commercial 
bills  commercial papers  certificate of deposits are short- term or money 
market securities  Equities  Preference shares  Debentures and Bonds are 
long term or capital market securities 
On the Basis of Settlement of Deals 
Securities may be classified into Forward securities and Cash 
securities  Forward securities are those in which the settlement date can 
be shifted from one settlement date to other by paying the badla charges 
Cash securities are those for which settlement dates cannot be shifted 
The Forward securities are known by different names viz  specified shares 
or group A shares or Forward section  Cash securities are also known as 
Non-specified shares or group B shares or cash section

Stock Market in India 
From scattered and small beginnings in the   th Century  India s 
stock market has risen to great heights  In   we had   stock exchanges 
in the country  There were around   listed companies and the invested 
population stood around   million  You might be interested in knowing 
more about the growth of stock market in India  What functions does it 
perform  What is the form of organization of stock exchange in India 
How are they administered  What is the trading system followed on these 
exchanges  We shall discuss these and other questions in the following 
sections 
Role and Functions of Stock Exchanges 
The history of stock exchanges shows that the development of 
joint stock enterprise would never have reached its present stage but 
for the facilities which the stock exchanges provide for dealing with the 
securities  Stock exchanges have a very important function to fulfill in 
the country s economy  The stock exchange is really an essential pillar of 
the private sector corporate economy  It discharges essential functions in 
the process of capital formation and in raising resources for the corporate 
sector 
Liquidity and Marketability of Securities 
The stock exchange provides a market place for purchase and sale 
of securities viz  shares  bonds  debentures etc  It  therefore  ensures the 
free transferability of securities which is the essential basis for the stock 
enterprise system  The private sector economy cannot function without 
the assurance provided by the exchange to the owners of shares and 
bonds that they can be sold in the market at any time  At the same time 
those who invest their surplus funds in securities for long-term capital 
appreciation or for speculative purpose can also buy scripts of their choice 
in the market 
Capital Formation 
The stock exchange provides the linkage between the savings in the 
household sector and investment in corporate economy  It mobilizes savings 
 Notes 
and channelizes them in the form of securities into those enterprises which 
are favoured by the investors on the basis of such criteria as future growth 
prospects  good returns and appreciation of capital 
Fair Price Determination 
By providing a market quotation of the prices of shares and bonds  a 
sort of collective judgement simultaneously reached by many buyers and 
sellers in the market  the stock exchange serves the role of barometer  not 
only of the state of health of individual companies  but also of the nation s 
economy 
The changes in share prices are brought about by a complex set 
of factors  all operating in the market simultaneously  Share values as a 
whole are subject to secular trends set by the economic programme of the 
nation  and governed by factors like general economic situation  financial 
and monetary policies  tax changes  political environment  international - 
economic and financial development  etc 
Membership  Organization and Management 
Natures of the century-old traditional stock exchanges are a 
highly organized and smoothly functioning network in the world  The 
membership of stock exchanges initially comprised of individuals and 
partnership firms  Later on the corporate entities and financial institutions 
were also allowed to become members  A number of financial institutions 
are now members of Indian Stock Exchanges 
Over the years  stock exchanges have been initiated in various 
forms  For example  while the Ahmedabad Stock Exchange and M P 
 Indore  Stock Exchange were started as Non-profit making association 
of persons  the Calcutta Stock Exchange  Delhi Stock Exchange  U P  Stock 
Exchange  Cochin Stock Exchange  Gauhati Stock Exchange  Bangalore 
Stock Exchange  Jaipur Stock Exchange and  Mangalore  Stock Exchange 
were established as public limited companies  Quite a few others have been 
started as Company limited by guarantee 
The entrance fee is different for different stock exchanges 
Membership deposit and annual fees also varies from exchange to 
exchange  The entrance fee is different for different members among 
various exchanges based on their status like individual or corporate 
 Notes 
The internal governance of exchange rests in a governing board 
comprising members of the board and Executive Director  The Members 
of the governing boards include brokers and SEBI Nominees called Public 
Representatives 
The Chairman is expected to ensure the position of Executive 
Director can t be expected to be very strong because if he really tries to 
be may bring him into conflict with influential broker-members who may 
also be on the exchange s board which determines Executive Director s 
terms and conditions of service and his re-appointment on this term  It 
is not human nature to displease one s appointing authorities and it may 
be too much Executive Director s to be strict under the present scheme of 
things  Subject to the previous approval of the law  governing bodies of 
stock exchanges have wide powers to make bye-laws  Governing bodies 
furnish  censure and also expel any member  and authorized clerk and 
employee  It has to adjudicate disputes  Above all  it has the power to 
make  amend  suspend and enforce rules  bye-regulations and supervises 
the entire functioning of a stock exchange 
To rationalize the functioning of the stock exchanges during 
the year   all the exchanges in India were de-mutualized under a 
compulsory scheme brought out by SEBI in the year   Except NSE 
all other exchanges were managed by the brokers who were members of 
the exchange by having major stake in the composition of the Governing 
Board 
After the demutualization  management of the exchange rests with 
the owners  non-brokers  with more than   representation in the board 
and minority representation of the Trading Members and SEBI nominees 
All the exchanges have become from Not-for profit organization to that of 
for-profit organizations  Those exchanges which have failed to complete 
the demutualization within the stipulated time frame as given by SEBI 
were cancelled of their recognition as an exchange and hence  they have 
lost their identity as exchange and cease to exist 
Trading System 
Trading on stock exchanges is done through brokers and dealers 
All members can act as brokers and for this purpose they have to maintain 
 Notes 
a minimum security deposit and additional security deposit also called 
as base capital which will decide on the trading exposure that the said 
broker will be allowed to  Brokers act as agents for buying and selling on 
behalf of their clients  for which they receive brokerage commission at 
stipulated rates 
The maximum brokerage that can be charged is restricted to  
of the value of transaction done and there is no minimum stipulated but 
it cannot be nil  except when the transactions are done for charitable 
organizations  Dealers act as principals and buy and sell securities on 
their own accounts  However  members cannot enter into contract with 
any person other than the member without prior permission of the 
governing Body 
The Trading system of NSE has enhanced its efficiency  liquidity 
and transparency  by introducing a nation-wide online fully-automated 
screen based trading system  SBTS  where a member can input into the 
computer trading terminal  the quantities of the securities he wanted to 
buy or sell and the prices at which he likes to transact and the transaction 
is executed as soon as it finds a matching sale or buy order from a counter 
party  SBTS electronically matches orders on a strict price time priority 
and hence cuts down on time  cost and risk of error  as well as on fraud 
resulting in improved operational efficiency 
It allows faster incorporation of price sensitive information into 
prevailing prices  thus increasing the informational efficiency of markets 
It enables market participants  irrespective of their geographical locations 
to trade with one another simultaneously  improving the depth and li- 
quidity of the market  It provides full anonymity by accepting orders  big 
or small  from members without revealing their identity  thus providing 
equal access to everybody  It also provides a perfect audit trail  which helps 
to resolve disputes by logging in the trade execution process in entirety 
An Overview of Stock Exchanges in India 
a  Bombay Stock Exchange of India Ltd 
The Bombay Stock Exchange is known as the oldest exchange in 
Asia  It traces its history to the  s  when stockbrokers would gather 
under banyan trees in front of Mumbai s Town Hall  The location of 
 Notes 
these meetings changed many times  as the number of brokers constantly 
increased  The group eventually moved to Dalal Street in   and in 
  became an official organization known as  The Native Share   Stock 
Brokers Association  In   the BSE became the first stock exchange to 
be recognized by the Indian Government under the Securities Contracts 
Regulation Act 
The Bombay Stock Exchange developed the BSE Sensex in  
giving the BSE a means to measure overall performance of the exchange 
In   the BSE used this index to open its derivatives market  trading 
Sensex futures contracts  The development of Sensex options along with 
equity derivatives followed in   and   expanding the BSE s trading 
platform  Historically an open-cry floor trading exchange  the Bombay 
Stock Exchange switched to an electronic trading system in   It took 
the exchange only fifty days to make this transition 
b  National Stock Exchange of India Ltd 
The National Stock Exchange of India Limited  NSE  was 
promoted by IDBI  ICICI  IFCI  GIC  LIC  State Bank of India  SBI Capital 
Markets Limited  SHCIL and IL   FS as a Joint Stock Company under 
the Companies Act    on November   The Government of 
India has granted recognition with effect from April   initially for 
a period of five years  The GOI has appointed IDBI as a lead promoter  To 
form the infrastructure of NSE  IDBI had appointed a Hongkong Bound 
consulting firm M s  International Securities Consulting Limited for 
helping in setting up of the NSE 
The main objective of NSE is to ensure comprehensive nationwide 
securities trading facilities to investors through automated screen based 
trading called NEAT and automatic post trade clearing and settlement 
facilities  The NSE encourages corporate trading members with dealer 
networks  computerized trading and short settlement cycles  It has three 
segments  one dealing with wholesale debt instruments  the second to 
deal with capital market instruments called cash segment and the third 
for Futures and Options or Derivatives Market  The Clearing Corporation 
of India Limited  CCIL  an Electronic Clearing and Depository System 
 ECDS  set up by the Stock Holding Corporation of India Limited 
 SHCIL  provides the requisite clearing and settlement systems  The 
 Notes 
recommendations of the High Power Committee on setting up of the 
National Stock Exchange  a  Model Exchange  at New Mumbai to act as 
a National Stock Exchange  NSE  to provide access to all investors from 
across the country on an equal footing  and work as Integral component 
of the National Stock Market System  Hence  NSE is having the following 
vital features 
     
NSE is promoted by Financial Institutions  Mutual Funds  and 
financed on a self-sustaining basis through levy of membership 
fees  The capital outlay of   crores of rupees was financed by 
admitting   members with an entry fee of   lakhs each  Fees 
for corporate and Institutional members were at a higher level of 
  lakhs 
     
NSE is a company incorporated under the Companies Act of  
It is constituted by the Board of Directors  Board  and managed 
by it    per cent of the Managing Board of the Exchange comprise 
of professionals who are not members  These professionals must 
be from a cross section of finance and industry  and must actively 
contribute to ensuring that the stock exchange functions in a 
balanced and fair manner 
     
It is trading on large   medium sized securities of equity shares and 
debt instruments 
     
It is a separate ring altogether  For the first time in our country  debt 
instruments were traded to become an active part in the secondary 
market of the nation 
     
NSE made its debut with the debt market  The debt market is 
predominantly a market in Government Securities  The Central 
Government moving over to auctions at market-related rates 
of interest  the primary market has become active with the well 
informed and fine-tuned bidding at the auctions 
     
It is having full support from the National Clearing and Settlement 
divisions  SHCIL and the Securities Facilities Support Corporation 
It is using modern computer technology for the clearance and 
settlement procedures 
     
Better transparency system for the securities trading   settlement 
 Notes 
In the very first year of its operation  NSE became the leading stock 
exchange in the country  impacting the fortunes of other exchanges and 
forcing them to adopt SBTS also  Today India can boast that almost  
trading take place through electronic order matching  Technology was 
used to carry the trading platform from the trading hall of stock exchanges 
to the premises of brokers  NSE carried the trading platform further to the 
PCs at the residence of investors through the Internet and to handheld 
devices through WAP for convenience of mobile investors  This made a 
huge difference in terms of equal access to investors in a geographically 
vast country like India 
The trading network is depicted in above  NSE has main computer 
which is connected through Very Small Aperture Terminal  VSAT 
installed at its office  The main computer runs on a fault tolerant STRATUS 
mainframe computer at the Exchange  Brokers have terminals installed at 
their premises which are connected through VSATs leased lines modems 
An investor informs a broker to place an order on his behalf  The broker 
enters the order through his PC  which runs under Windows NT and sends 
signal to the Satellite via VSAT leased line modem  The signal is directed 
to mainframe 
Both BSE and NSE have national presence and they dominate the 
stock markets  All other exchanges have created a platform by having 
either an alliance with or cross holding with these two premier exchanges 
or trading facility provided to their members through a subsidiary of the 
main exchanges 
c  Over The Counter Exchange of India  OTCEI 
Indeed in mid-eighties itself the G S  Patel Committee on Stock 
Exchange reforms and the Abid Holi Committee on Capital Markets had 
recommended for the creation of a second tier stock market that will 
solve some of the problems of present stock exchanges  Over The Counter 
Exchange of India  OTCEI  was been promoted by  UTI  IDBI  IFCI  LIC 
GIC  SBI Capital Market and Canbank Financial Services as a non profit- 
making company under Section   of the Companies Act    The 
OTCEI is a recognized Stock Exchange under section   of the Securities 
Contracts  Regulation  Act    Hence companies listed on the OTC 
Exchange enjoy the same status as companies listed on any other stock 
exchanges in the country 
 Notes 
OTC Exchange of India has picked the model from the NASDAQ 
system  National Association of Security Dealers-Automated Quotations 
prevalent in the United States of America  Modifications suited to Indian 
conditions been adopted from OTC in America was an offshoot of their 
government s efforts to regulate the unlisted securities act  The Indian 
version of NASD National Associations of Securities Dealers is what is 
called OTC Exchange of India  Unlike in the regular exchange  listing on 
OTCEI is a national listing from day one 
Wherever and whenever counters start operating in the country 
they can trade in all the scripts of OTCEI  Separate listing in those regular 
places is not needed at all  All said and done the OTCEI did not take off 
and was not successful due to many reasons like lower end technology  low 
liquidity  less participation by investors in small cap companies  etc 
d  Inter-connected Stock Exchange of India 
Inter-connected Stock Exchange of India Limited  ISE  has been 
promoted by   Regional stock exchanges to provide trading linkage 
connectivity to all the participating exchanges to widen their market  Thus 
ISE is a national level exchange providing trading  clearing  settlement 
risk management and surveillance support to the Inter-Connected Market 
System  ICMS 
ISE aims to address the needs of small companies and retail 
investors with the guiding principle of optimizing the infrastructure and 
harnessing the potential of regional markets to transform these into a 
liquid and vibrant market through the use of technology and networking 
The participating exchange in ISE has in all about   traders 
In order to leverage its infrastructure as also to expand its nation- 
wide reach  ISE has also appointed dealers across various cities other than 
the participating exchange centres  These dealers are administratively 
supported through strategically located regional offices at Delhi  Calcutta 
Chennai and Nagpur 
ISE  thus expects to emerge as a low cost national level exchange 
in the country for retail investors and small intermediaries  ISE has also 
floated a wholly-owned subsidiary namely  ISE Securities and Services 
 Notes 
Limited  ISS  to take membership of NSE and other premier exchanges  so 
that traders and dealers of ISE can access other markets in addition to the 
local market and ISE 
This will provide the investors in smaller cities with a solution 
for cost-effective and efficient trading in securities  Core objectives of 
the Inter-connected Stock Exchange include creation of single integrated 
national level solution with access to multiple markets for providing high 
quality  low cost services to millions of investors across the country  a 
liquid and vibrant national level market for all listed companies in general 
and small capital companies in particular and providing trading  clearing 
and settlement facilities to the traders and dealers across the country at 
their doorstep with decentralized support system  Some of the features 
which make ISE a new age stock exchange are as follows 
     
ISE is a national level recognised stock exchange having moderate 
listing fees and granting listing and trading permission to small and 
medium sized companies having a post public issue paid-up capital 
of     crore to     crore  subject to the appointment of market 
makers  besides companies with a capital of above     crore 
     
All traders and dealers of ISE have access to NSE through ISE 
Securities and Services Ltd   ISS  which ensures continuous 
attention of investors 
     
Proposing to introduce the  IPO Distribution System  for offering 
primary market issue 
     
ISE has set up an  Investors Grievance and Service Cell  which looks 
after all types of complaints of investors located across the country 
and provides decentralised support 
     
Listing of stocks with ISE would give the company an advantage 
of being identified as a technology-savvy and Investor-friendly 
company 
Demutualization of Stock Exchanges 
Historically stock exchanges were formed as  mutual  organizations 
which were considered beneficial in terms of tax benefits and matters of 
compliance  They are generally  not-for-profit  and tax exempted entities 
 Notes 
The trading members who provide broking services  also own  control and 
manage such exchanges for their common benefit  but do not distribute 
the profits among themselves  The ownership rights and trading rights are 
clubbed together in a membership card which is not freely transferable 
and hence this card at times carries a premium  In contrast  in a  demutual 
exchange  three separate sets of people own the exchange  manage it and 
use its services 
The ownership usually vests in management constituting a board of 
directors which is assisted by a professional team  A completely different 
set of people use trading platform of the exchange  These are generally  for- 
profit  and taxpaying entities  The ownership rights are freely transferable 
Trading rights are acquired   surrendered in terms of transparent rules 
Membership cards do not exist  These two models of exchanges are 
generally referred to as  club  and  institution  respectively 
The most important development in the capital market is 
demutualization of the stock exchanges  Demutualization means 
segregating the ownership from management  This move was necessitated 
by the fact that brokers in the management of the stock exchange were 
misusing their position for personal gains  Demutualization would bring 
in transparency and prevent conflict of interest in the functioning of the 
stock exchanges  Now  all the stock exchanges in India are demutualised 
entities

 Notes 
Mutual Funds 
A mutual fund is a type of professionally managed collective 
investment vehicle that pools money from many investors to purchase 
securities  While there is no legal definition of the term  mutual fund  it 
is most commonly applied only to those collective investment vehicles that 
are regulated and sold to the general public  They are sometimes referred 
to as  investment companies  or  registered investment companies  Most 
mutual funds are  open-ended  meaning investors can buy or sell shares 
of the fund at any time  Hedge funds are not considered a type of mutual 
fund 
There is a three tier structure in the administration of mutual 
fund companies  viz  sponsors  trustee and asset management companies 
 AMCs  The trustee collects money from the investors and the AMCs 
invest the same in the securities market  The investment decisions are 
being taken by professionally qualified fund managers  The investments 
are held in the form of units and the investors are called unit holders 
The returns from the investments are distributed to the unit holders after 
deducting the expenses of AMCs  All the mutual funds are subject to the 
SEBI guidelines  The following figure explains the operation of mutual 
fund 
Figures showing the operation of mutual fund 
One can make money from a mutual fund in three ways 
     
Income is earned from dividends on stocks and interest on bonds 
A fund pays out nearly all of the income   it receives over the 
year to the unit holders in the form of a distribution 
 Notes 
     
If the fund sells securities that have increased in price  the fund has 
a capital gain  Most funds also pass on these gains to investors in a 
distribution 
     
If fund holdings increase in price but are not sold by the fund 
manager  the fund s shares increase in price  One can then sell his 
her mutual fund shares for a profit 
Benefits of Investing in a Mutual Fund 
     
Small investments  With mutual fund investments  money can be 
spread in small bits across varied companies  This way you reap the 
benefits of a diversified portfolio with small investments 
     
Professionally managed  The pool of money collected by a 
mutual fund is managed by professionals who possess considerable 
expertise  resources and experience  Through analysis of markets 
and economy  they help pick favourable investment opportunities 
     
Spreading risk  A mutual fund usually spreads the money in 
companies across a wide spectrum of industries  This not only 
diversifies the risk  but also helps take advantage of the position it 
holds 
     
Transparency and interactivity  Mutual funds clearly present their 
investment strategy to their investors and regularly provide them 
with information on the value of their investments  Also  a complete 
portfolio disclosure of the investments made by various schemes 
along with the proportion invested in each asset type is provided 
     
Liquidity  Closed ended funds can be bought and sold at their 
market value as they have their units listed at the stock exchange 
In addition to this  units can be directly redeemed to the mutual 
fund as and when they announce the repurchase 
     
Choice  A wide variety of schemes allow investors to pick up those 
which suit their risk   return profile 
     
Regulations  All the mutual funds are registered with SEBI  They 
function within the provisions of strict regulation created to protect 
the interests of the investor 
 Notes 
Classification of Mutual Funds 
Every investor has a different investment objective  Some go for 
stability and opt for safer securities such as bonds or government securities 
Those who have a higher risk appetite and yearn for higher returns may 
want to choose risk-bearing securities such as equities  Hence  mutual 
funds come with different schemes  each with a different investment 
objective  There are hundreds of mutual fund schemes to choose from 
Hence  they have been categorized as mentioned below 
     
By structure  Closed-Ended  Open-Ended Funds  Interval funds 
     
By nature  Equity  Debt  Balance or Hybrid 
     
By investment objective  Growth Schemes  Income Schemes 
Balanced Schemes  Index funds 
a  Types of Mutual Funds by Structure 
i  Close ended fund scheme  A close ended fund or scheme has a 
predetermined maturity period  eg   -  years  The fund is open 
for subscription during the launch of the scheme for a specified 
period of time  Investors can invest in the scheme at the time 
of the initial public issue and thereafter they can buy or sell the 
units on the stock exchanges where they are listed  In order to 
provide an exit route to the investors  some close ended funds give 
an option of selling back the units to the mutual fund through 
periodic repurchase at NAV related prices or they are listed in 
secondary market 
ii  Open ended fund scheme  The most common type of mutual fund 
available for investment is an open-ended mutual fund  Investors 
can choose to invest or transact in these schemes as per their 
convenience  In an open-ended mutual fund  there is no limit to 
the number of investors  shares  or overall size of the fund  unless 
the fund manager decides to close the fund to new investors in 
order to keep it manageable  The value or share price of an open- 
ended mutual fund is determined at the market close every day 
and is called the Net Asset Value  NAV 
iii  Interval schemes  Interval schemes combine the features of open- 
ended and close-ended schemes  The units may be traded on the 
 Notes 
stock exchange or may be open for sale or redemption during 
pre-determined intervals at NAV related prices  FMPs or Fixed 
maturity plans are examples of these types of schemes 
b  Types of Mutual Funds by Nature 
i  Equity mutual funds  These funds invest maximum part of their 
corpus into equity holdings  The structure of the fund may vary 
for different schemes and the fund manager s outlook on different 
stocks  The Equity funds are sub-classified depending upon their 
investment objective such as Diversified equity funds  Mid-cap 
funds  Small cap funds  Sector specific funds and Tax savings 
funds  ELSS  Equity investments rank high on the risk-return grid 
and hence  are ideal for a longer time frame 
ii  Debt mutual funds  These funds invest in debt instruments to 
ensure low risk and provide a stable income to the investors 
Government authorities  private companies  banks and financial 
institutions are some of the major issuers of debt papers  Debt 
funds can be further classified into Gilt funds  Income funds 
MIPs  Short term plans and Liquid funds 
iii  Balanced funds  They invest in both equities and fixed income 
securities which are in line with pre-defined investment objective 
of the scheme  The equity portion provides growth while debt 
provides stability in returns  This way  investors get to taste the 
best of both worlds 
c  Types of Mutual Funds by Investment Objective 
i  Growth schemes  Also known as equity schemes  these schemes 
aim at providing capital appreciation over medium to long term 
These schemes normally invest a major portion of their fund in 
equities and are willing to withstand short-term decline in value 
for possible future appreciation 
ii  Income schemes  Also known as debt schemes  they generally 
invest in fixed income securities such as bonds and corporate 
debentures  These schemes aim at providing regular and steady 
income to investors  However  capital appreciation in such schemes 
may be limited 
 Notes 
iii  Index schemes  These schemes attempt to reproduce the 
performance of a particular index such as the BSE Sensex or the 
NSE   Their portfolios will consist of only those stocks that 
constitute the index  The percentage of each stock to the total 
holding will be identical to the stocks index weight age  And hence 
the returns from such schemes would be more or less equivalent to 
those of the Index 
Indian Fiscal System 
Fiscal system of a country refers to the revenue and capital resources 
that can be raised by government  the procedure to be observed in raising 
and spending funds and in case of a federation such as ours the provision 
that governs the relationship of the constituent unit of federation  It 
includes within its purview taxation  expenditure  debt management 
and inter-governmental fiscal relation  Indian fiscal system is based on 
the constitution of India which is federal in character  The constitution 
envisages two layers of government  the Union of central government and 
the state government  Local bodies do not find a place in the constitution 
and the function and resources allotted to them are delegated by the state 
government 
Division and Functions 
The constitution distributes the legislative function and resources 
into three lists 
     
The Union list  defence  foreign relation  railway  currency 
     
The state list  education  medical public health  police  law   order 
     
The concurrent list  trade union  planning   price policy 
The taxes over which there is legislative jurisdiction of centre 
extends fall under four groups 
     
Group I  The taxes which are levied and collected by the union and 
the proceeds are retained by it  These are corporation tax  custom 
duties  and taxes on capital value of asset of individual 
 Notes 
     
Group II  The taxes levied and collected by the union but the 
proceeds of which are shared with the states  These are Income tax 
and excise duties 
     
Group III  The taxes which are levied and collected by the union 
and the proceeds are assigned to states with in which they are levied 
These are succession and estate duties in respect to property other 
then agriculture land  taxes on goods and passenger carried railway 
sea and air 
     
Group IV  The taxes which are levied by the union but the proceeds 
are of which are collected and retained by state  These are stamp 
duties and duties on excise on medicine and toilet preparation 
containing alcohol 
Expenditure of Government 
The total expenditure consists of revenue expenditure  
and capital expenditure   Revenue expenditure is administrative 
expenditure  and capital expenditure is spent towards capital or asset 
formation  The total expenditure may also be classified into plan  
and non-plan expenditure  
Non Plan expenditure include Interest payment  Defense 
expenditure  Subsidies  Grant to state and UT government  Grant to 
foreign government and Other non plan expenditure 
Expenditure of Central Government include General Service 
Organ of state  Tax collection  Police   Pension  Write off loan  Others 
Social Service  Education  Sports   Youth affairs  Health and family 
welfare  Water supply  Housing  Information and broadcasting  Labour 
and employment  Welfare of ST SC   OBC  Others Economic Services 
Agriculture   Allied activities  Rural development  Irrigation and flood 
control  Energy  Industry   minerals  Transport  Communication  Science 
Technology   Environment and Postal Services Loan  and Advances 
Receipt of Central Government 
Receipt of Central Government includes tax revenue  non-tax 
revenue and capital receipts 
 Notes

Corporation Tax  Interest tax  Expenditure Tax  Custom Duty  Union Ex- 
cise Duties  Wealth Tax  Gift Tax  Other Tax  Taxes on UT  and Service Tax 
Non-tax revenue include Fiscal Service  Interest Receipt  Dividend 
and profit  Other general service  Social service  Economic Service  UT 
without Legislature  and Grant in aid   contribution 
Capital Receipts include receipts from International debt Market 
External assistance  Recovery of Loan  Small saving  State provident fund 
Special deposit  Disinvestment and Others 
Deficits 
a  Budget Deficit  Budget Deficit   Total Expenditure   Total 
Revenue  The excess of revenue expenditure over revenue receipts 
It shows the deficit of government on current account 
Revenue Deficit   Revenue Expenditure   Revenue Receipts   The 
excess of all expenditure over all types of receipts including borrowings 
b  Fiscal Deficit  Fiscal Deficit   Revenue Deficit   Capital 
expenditure  The excess of expenditure over revenue receipts 
and non debt capital receipts  It represents the total borrowing 
requirement of the central government 
Primary Deficit   Gross Fiscal deficit   Interest Payments  Fiscal 
deficit net of interest payments  It is the non interest deficit and reflects 
the current fiscal of the government 
Monetised Deficit  The part of fiscal deficit which is financed by 
RBI through printing of notes 
Impact of Fiscal Deficit on the Economy 
     
The fiscal deficit measures the shortfall in government ability to 
fund its expenditure through regular sources  Sources of funds for 
a government are of kind- revenue and capital 
 Notes 
     
Fiscal Deficit is important to annual budget  The budget is the 
government annual report  which differs from corporate annual 
report in one key area-a budget gives projection or next year s 
number alongside its performance for a finished year 
     
Fiscal Deficit represents the extent to which the government needs 
fund  but does not have them  Government of India is the largest 
borrower in India  Annual borrowings of Government are probably 
larger than that of entire corporate sector 
     
Besides  borrowing the government has another way of finding 
funds it does not have  Being the law maker of the land gives the 
government the power to create money which is simply printing 
additional notes  This is called monetization 
     
Fiscal Deficit to some extent is fine  One typically looks at ratio 
of FD to gross domestic product  This ratio should ideally remain 
around   for a country like India  says the IMF  A much higher 
number is bad news  The government has large role to play in the 
economy in areas like infrastructure  education  social support 
 India does not have this  defence  civil administration  and so on 
Government needs are likely to more than its income in a growing 
economy 
     
Fiscal Deficit has a lot of impact on government policy  For example 
if it turns out to be very high in a year  the government will have to 
either borrow a lot or print a lot of money  Borrowing a lot will push 
up interest rate there by making the economy costlier and reducing 
competitiveness of goods produced vis- -vis those made by other 
country  Printing lots of money breeds inflation  which is also bad 
beyond a point 
     
Sustained high deficits can lead to very high accumulation of debt 
by the government leading to what is called internal debt trap 
     
Fiscal Deficit can be kept within a limit either through increasing 
revenue or cutting expenses or both  Revenue can be increased in 
three fashions - increase tax rate or tax more things or reduce tax 
evasion  In cutting expenses Government of India has traditionally 
taken easier route  like cutting infrastructure spending instead 
harder ones like cutting subsidies or freezing recruitment

CASE STUDY 
Failed IPO shows that manipulators have withdrawn from the game 
Vaswani Industries Ltd s Initial Public Offering  IPO  was closed 
for subscription on  rd May and share allotment details were published 
on  th May   After the allotment was published on the registrar s 
website  retail investors were upset to see that they had received many 
more shares than what had been allocated  Even though the issue was 
subscribed   times in the retail category  investors got share allotment 
of equivalent to   times over-subscription in this category  SEBI started 
its investigation after getting complaints from high net-worth individuals 
and retail investors 
The market regulator has collected bidding data from the registrar 
to the issue  Link in time  and has written to the two exchanges - NSE 
and BSE- to stop listing of the stock till it completes the investigations 
into the bidding and the subsequent withdrawal of applications  How did 
this happen The game starts when greedy promoters shop for investment 
bankers who would promise the highest IPO price for their shares 
Invariably  the issues get a poor retail response and in the first couple of 
days after an IPO opens for subscription  panic sets in 
The investment bankers then helpfully bring in financiers who 
demand a   to   discount to put in applications  These financiers 
also have the capability of making   to   retail applications if 
required  Yes  the multiple applications scam is thriving  but has only got 
more sophisticated to evade detection  Our sources say that investment 
bankers are an integral part of this racket  Another aspect of the scam is 
pure extortion  Here  some unscrupulous financiers prey on IPOs that get 
a poor response on opening 
They then put in large applications to corner the retail quota  On 
issue-closing day  they call the company and its investment bankers and 
threaten to withdraw their application unless they are given a cash payoff 
With little time to rustle up genuine applications  a couple of promoters 
have succumbed to the blackmail  In either case  with a block of thinly- 
traded stock in their control  the price manipulators financiers get to work 
 Notes 
once the stock gets listed  They rig the shares up and down  liquidate their 
entire stake and walk out  With the market in doldrums  the manipulators 
and financiers have withdrawn from the game  That s why the issue has 
failed miserably 
Question 
  Discusses the various irregularities happened in the Vaswani IPO to 
inflate demand and mislead Retail Individual Investors  RIIs  and

Accountant certifies that the orders in fact were firmly booked 
and execution began during the period of agreement and the 
technical assistance was available on a continuing basis even

Approval of Collaboration Proposals 
Approval for Foreign Collaboration   Joint Venture 
At present in India most of the Foreign Collaboration or Joint 
Venture does not require any approval prior approval from Government 
of India  However any Joint Venture or Foreign Collaboration where the 
Foreign Equity Participation exceeds the prescribed limit allowed for 
automatic route would require prior approval as per the provisions of 
FEMA and Government Investment Policy 
Approval for Foreign Technology Agreements 
The Government now provides for automatic approval most of the 
technology agreements as subject to FEMA  Applications for automatic 
approval must be made to the Reserve Bank of India  RBI  and must 
clearly state the description of the goods to be manufactured in the Indian 
Trade Classification System  After RBI approval  the entrepreneurs may 
approach authorized dealers for foreign exchange release along with 
a copy of the technology agreement  All other proposals must comply 
with general procedures in force  In order to give Indian industries more 
freedom in negotiating foreign technology agreements  the government no 
longer requires the companies to obtain approval for the hiring of foreign 
technicians and foreign testing of indigenously developed technologies

 Lesson   - Offshore Country Funds  Foreign Venture 
Capital Investments  Other Foreign Investments  
International Capital Markets 
Learning Objectives 
     
To understand the meaning and advantages of offshore country 
funds 
     
To understand the provisions relating to Foreign Venture Capital 
Investments 
     
To get an insight into the other forms of Foreign Investments 
     
To understand the phases in internationalization of capital markets 
Offshore Country Funds 
An  offshore  investment vehicle is located in a different country 
than the one where you live  There is another  more informal definition of 
 offshore  an investment entity that is located in a country that specializes in 
hosting  offshore  entities  Some of the best-known examples are Bermuda 
the Cayman Islands  the Channel Islands  and Malta  Thus  An offshore 
fund can be defined as a collective investment scheme domiciled in an 
Offshore Financial Centre such as the British Virgin Islands  Luxembourg 
or the Cayman Islands  it is typically sold exclusively to  foreign  investors 
 those not of the domestic fund sponsor s country of origin 
Thus  a common example could involve an offshore fund managed 
or sponsored by a U S -based money manager  organized under the laws 
of the Cayman Islands and sold exclusively to non-U S  investors  For the 
purposes of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act   of the UK  an 
offshore fund is one which is governed by the Offshore Fund Rules set 
out in that Act  The vast majority of offshore funds are organized under 
the laws of the Cayman Islands  with the British Virgin Islands being the 
second most popular domicile 
 Advantages 
Offshore funds offer eligible investors significant tax benefits 
compared to many high tax jurisdictions  An offshore fund can be 
managed similarly however without the high taxes otherwise involved with 
a similarly managed U S  organized fund  Where income is repatriated 
 paid or transferred  to high tax jurisdictions  however  such income is 
usually taxed at normal rates as foreign sourced or arising income  Many 
of these tax-haven locations are considered investor-friendly and are 
internationally regarded as financially secure  Many offshore jurisdictions 
notably the British Virgin Islands  offer a zero-tax regime for investment 
funds which are domiciled there  which allows the fund to reinvest that 
part of its investment portfolio s gains which would otherwise have been 
lost to tax  In addition  the regulatory regime in these offshore jurisdictions 
is deliberately light  with emphasis placed on the importance of balancing 
effective regulation for the benefit of the protection of investors on the 
one hand  with the establishment of a regime in which the conduct of 
investment business is fast and simple  A number of offshore jurisdictions 
have recently tightened the regulation of offshore funds

International Capital Markets 
A capital market is basically a market where long term funds are 
borrowed and lent  International capital market is a market in which 
governments  companies  and people borrow and invest across national 
boundaries  In addition to the benefits and purposes of a domestic capital 
market  international capital markets provide the following benefits 
a  Higher returns and cheaper borrowing costs  These allow 
companies and governments to tap into foreign markets and access 
new sources of funds  Many domestic markets are too small or 
too costly for companies to borrow in  By using the international 
capital markets  companies  governments  and even individuals can 
borrow or invest in other countries for either higher rates of return 
or lower borrowing costs 
b  Diversifying risk  The international capital markets allow 
individuals  companies  and governments to access more 
opportunities in different countries to borrow or invest  which in 
turn reduces risk  The theory is that not all markets will experience 
contractions at the same time 
Components of International Capital Markets 
The structure of the international capital markets falls into two 
components primary and secondary  The primary market is where 
new securities  stocks and bonds are the most common  are issued  If a 
corporation or government agency needs funds  it issues  sells  securities 
to purchasers in the primary market  Big investment banks assist in this 
issuing process as intermediaries  The vast majority of capital transactions 
take place in the secondary market  The secondary market includes stock 
exchanges  the New York Stock Exchange  the London Stock Exchange 
and the Tokyo Nikkei  bond markets  and futures and options markets 
among others  The important components of international capital markets 
include 
i 
International Equity Markets  Companies sell their stock in the 
equity markets  International equity market consists of all the stock 
traded outside the issuing company s home country  Many large 
global companies seek to take advantage of the global financial 
 Notes 
centers and issue stock in major markets to support local and 
regional operations  For example  Arcelor Mittal is a global steel 
company headquartered in Luxembourg  it is listed on the stock 
exchanges of New York  Amsterdam  Paris  Brussels  Luxembourg 
Madrid  Barcelona  Bilbao  and Valencia  While the daily value of 
the global markets changes  in the past decade the international 
equity markets have expanded considerably  offering global firms 
increased options for financing their global operations  The key 
factors for the increased growth in the international equity markets 
are the following 
     
Growth of developing markets  As developing countries 
experience growth  their domestic firms seek to expand 
into global markets and take advantage of cheaper and more 
flexible financial markets 
     
Drive to privatize  In the past two decades  the general trend 
in developing and emerging markets has been to privatize 
formerly state-owned enterprises  These entities tend to be 
large  and when they sell some or all of their shares  it infuses 
billions of dollars of new equity into local and global markets 
Domestic and global investors  eager to participate in the 
growth of the local economy  buy these shares 
     
Investment banks  With the increased opportunities in 
new emerging markets and the need to simply expand their 
own businesses  investment banks often lead the way in the 
expansion of global equity markets  These specialized banks 
seek to be retained by large companies in developing countries 
or the governments pursuing privatization to issue and sell the 
stocks to investors with deep pockets outside the local country 
     
Technology advancements  The expansion of technology into 
global finance has opened new opportunities to investors and 
companies around the world  Technology and the Internet 
have provided more efficient and cheaper means of trading 
stocks and  in some cases  issuing shares by smaller companies 
b  International Bond Markets  Bonds are the most common form of 
debt instrument  which is basically a loan from the holder to the 
issuer of the bond  The international bond market consists of all the 
 Notes 
bonds sold by an issuing company  government  or entity outside 
their home country  Companies might access the international 
bond markets for a variety of reasons  including funding a new 
production facility or expanding its operations in one or more 
countries  There are several types of international bonds 
i 
Foreign Bond  A foreign bond is a bond sold by a company 
government  or entity in another country and issued in the 
currency of the country in which it is being sold  There are foreign 
exchange  economic  and political risks associated with foreign 
bonds  and many sophisticated buyers and issuers of these bonds 
use complex hedging strategies to reduce the risks  For example 
the bonds issued by global companies in Japan denominated in 
yen are called samurai bonds  As you might expect  there are 
other names for similar bond structures  Foreign bonds sold in 
the United States and denominated in US dollars are called Yankee 
bonds  In the United Kingdom  these foreign bonds are called 
bulldog bonds  Foreign bonds issued and traded throughout 
Asia except Japan  are called dragon bonds  which are typically 
denominated in US dollars  Foreign bonds are typically subject to 
the same rules and guidelines as domestic bonds in the country 
in which they are issued  There are also regulatory and reporting 
requirements  which make them a slightly more expensive bond 
than the Eurobond  The requirements add small costs that can add 
up given the size of the bond issues by many companies 
ii 
Eurobond  A Eurobond is a bond issued outside the country in 
whose currency it is denominated  Eurobonds are not regulated 
by the governments of the countries in which they are sold  and 
as a result  Eurobonds are the most popular form of international 
bond  A bond issued by a Japanese company  denominated in US 
dollars  and sold only in the United Kingdom and France is an 
example of a Eurobond 
iii  Global Bond  A global bond is a bond that is sold simultaneously in 
several global financial centers  It is denominated in one currency 
usually US dollars or Euros  By offering the bond in several 
markets at the same time  the company can reduce its issuing costs 
This option is usually reserved for higher rated  creditworthy  and 
typically very large firms

Phases in the Internationalization of Capital Markets 
One of the most important developments since the  s has been 
the internationalization  and now globalization  of capital markets  The 
phases in the internationalization of capital markets include the following 
   The International Capital Market of the Late  s was Composed 
of a Number of Closely Integrated Markets with an International 
Dimension 
Basically  the international capital market includes any transaction 
with an international dimension  It is not really a single market but a number 
of closely integrated markets that include some type of international 
component  The foreign exchange market was a very important part of the 
international capital market during the late  s  Internationally traded 
stocks and bonds have also been part of the international capital market 
Since the late  s  sophisticated communications systems have allowed 
people all over the world to conduct business from wherever they are 
The major world financial centers include Hong Kong  Singapore  Tokyo 
London  New York  and Paris  among others 
   The Need to Reduce Risk Through Portfolio Diversification Explains 
in Part the Importance of the International Capital Market During 
the Late  s 
A major benefit of the internationalization of capital markets is 
the diversification of risk  Individual investors  major corporations  and 
individual countries all usually try to diversify the risks of their financial 
portfolios  The reason is that people are generally risk-averse  They would 
rather get returns on investments that are in a relatively narrow band 
than investments that have wild fluctuations year-to-year  All portfolio 
investors look at the risk of their portfolios versus their returns  Higher 
risk investments generally have the potential to yield higher returns  but 
there is much more variability  Portfolio diversification looks at the risk 
versus the return available to get the highest return possible at the lowest 
possible risk  When an investor or a company invests in many different 
assets  stocks  bonds  mutual funds  etc  risk is reduced because there 
is less reliance on any single asset  By using world markets  risk can be 
reduced even more 
 Notes 
   The Principal Actors in the International Capital Markets of the Late 
 s were Banks  Non-Bank Financial Institutions  Corporations 
and Government Agencies 
Commercial banks powered their way to a place of considerable 
influence in international markets during the late  s  The primary 
reason for this was that they often pursued international activities that 
they would not have been able to undertake in their home countries 
Commercial banks undertook a broad array of financial activities during 
the late  s  Non-bank financial institutions became another fast-rising 
force in international markets during the late  s  Insurance companies 
pension and trust funds  and mutual funds from many countries began 
to diversify into international markets in the  s  Together  portfolio 
enhancement and a widespread increase in fund contributors have 
accounted for the strength these funds had in the international marketplace 
   Changes in the International Marketplace Resulted in a New Era of 
Global Capital Markets During the Late  s  which were Critical to 
Development 
First  citizens around the world  and especially the Japanese  began 
to increase their personal savings  Second  many governments further 
deregulated their capital markets since   This allowed domestic 
companies more opportunities abroad  and foreign companies had the 
opportunity to invest in the deregulated countries  Finally  technological 
advances made it easier to access global markets  Information could be 
retrieved quicker  easier  and cheaper than ever before  This allowed 
investors in one country to obtain more detailed information about 
investments in other countries  and obtain it quite efficiently  So  in the 
late  s we witnessed the globalization of markets - i e  the increased 
integration of domestic markets into a global economy  This differed 
from the process of internationalization  which connected less integrated 
domestic markets of the past with offshore markets  The global capital 
markets became critical to development in an open economy 
Sources of Capital 
There are two sources of capital  private sources and public sources 
Both sources are very important to the economies of the world  Capital 
 Notes 
flows result when funds are transferred across borders  the flows are 
recorded in the balance of payments account 
a  Private Sources of Capital  Foreign direct investment and portfolio 
investment  both debt and equity flows  are important sources of 
private capital  They are already explained in the earlier lessons 
b  Public Sources of Capital  Public sources of capital include official 
non-concessional loans of both multilateral and bilateral aid and 
official development assistance  ODA  ODA is made up of grants 
and concessional multilateral and bilateral loans 
     
Official non-concessional loans  multilateral   bilateral aid 
Official non-concessional multilateral aid consists of loans 
from the World Bank  regional development banks  and other 
intergovernmental agencies such as multilateral organizations 
The term  non-concessional  refers to the fact that these loans 
are based on market rates  must be repaid  and are not partly 
grants  By contrast  official non-concessional bilateral aid 
is loans from governments and their central banks or other 
agencies  Export credit agency loans are also included here 
 Bilateral  refers to the fact that the entities providing the 
funding provide aid only in their home country 
     
ODA  official grants and concessional loans  ODA refers 
in part to official public grants that are legally binding 
commitments and provide a specific amount of capital available 
to disburse for which no repayment is required  Concessional 
bilateral aid refers to aid from governments  central banks  and 
export credit agencies that contains a partial grant element  
or more  or partially forgives the loan  Similarly  concessional 
multilateral aid contains a partial grant  or forgiveness of the 
loan  Multilateral aid comes from the World Bank  regional 
development banks and intergovernmental agencies 
c  Private Capital Became Very Important to Development in 
the Late  s  During the  s  the sources of capital for 
developing countries changed drastically  Private funding  however 
skyrocketed  Clearly  there was a fundamental change in the 
sources of funds for developing countries to draw from during the 
late  s  Why did this major change occur  As stated previously 
 Notes 
international portfolio diversification became more prevalent 
every day  Insurance companies  mutual funds  pension funds  and 
securities houses were looking to diversify  They also had more 
funds than ever to invest  Worldwide  portfolios were absorbing an 
increasing share of aggregate savings  These portfolios were coming 
more and more under the control of professional fund managers 
As overall international portfolio diversification grew  so too did 
the share of international portfolio diversification that went to developing 
countries  Capital flows to developing countries acted as catalysts 
propelling the world closer to a seamless global marketplace during the late 
 s  The growth of global institutional investors resulted in capital flows 
to emerging markets based more on short-term liquidity and performance 
than long-term business ventures  To protect themselves from the risks of 
these volatile cash flows  developing countries can take some precautionary 
measures  The central bank can intervene in foreign exchange markets and 
capital controls can be imposed 
Conclusion 
India has been able to provide an enabling environment to foreign 
investors in several respects  Deep reforms in capital markets aided by 
an efficient regulatory architecture have facilitated portfolio investments 
Transfer and acquisition of shares are taking place according to investor- 
friendly guidelines  Foreign exchange regulations have been aligned to 
global standards through FEMA  In the near future  it is hoped that more 
foreign capital would flow

CASE STUDY 
Clash of the titans  Overlapping and contradictory foreign 
investment regulations in India 
The SEBI and RBI have been working independently towards 
rationalising the existing investment regime to make it more investor- 
friendly  This shift in attitude is evident with the introduction by SEBI 
of Qualified Foreign Investors  QFIs  as a new class of investors  the 
promulgation of the SEBI  Alternative Investment Fund  Regulations 
  and permission granted by RBI to Foreign Venture Capital Investors 
 FVCIs  to participate in secondary transactions  In addition  RBI has 
allowed FVCIs to be active participants in stock exchanges which seems 
to encroach on the monopoly of Foreign Institutional Investors  FIIs 
regulated by SEBI FVCIs were permitted invest in venture capital funds 
and Indian venture capital undertakings  which are defined to mean 
companies not listed on a recognised stock exchange and to invest up to a 
third of their investible funds in preferential allotment by listed companies 
RBI s circular dated   March   extended this  allowing FVCIs to 
invest in eligible securities by way of private arrangement  purchase from 
a third party or by investing in securities on a recognised stock exchange 
Although the RBI Circular issued in this respect attempts to liberalise 
investments made by FVCIs in India  it is subject to provisions of SEBI 
Regulations  which currently don t allow FVCIs to invest in the manner 
permitted by RBI s Circular 
The SEBI s AIF Regulations  defines an Alternative Investment Fund 
 AIF  to mean any fund established or incorporated in India which collects 
funds from domestic and or foreign investors for investing the funds in 
accordance with a defined investment policy  However  the consolidated 
Foreign Direct Investment Policy effective from   April   does not 
permit foreign investments in AIFs  While  the Department of Industrial 
Policy and Promotion  DIPP  has in the last one year  issued clarifications 
and made changes to the FDI Policy  none of the press notes issued till date 
mention the possibility of foreign investments in AIFs  In addition to this 
the AIF Regulations created a category of AIFs that would be eligible for 
tax benefits  However  the government has not announced any benefits or 
conditions for funds to qualify as such AIFs so far  A similar disconnect is 
seen in the regime for QFIs who were allowed to invest in the Indian equity 
 and debt markets to boost foreign investment in the country  However 
this route hasn t seen much success due to the skepticism surrounding the 
tax risk for depositories whose clients are QFIs 
Question 
  What is the problem in this case  Give suggestions to solve the 
problem
